**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED MARCH 20, 2017**


**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

## NewCo Sab MidCo S.A.S.


### €180,000,000 % Senior Notes due 2025

NewCo Sab MidCo S.A.S., a société par actions simplifée incorporated under the laws of France (the “Issuer”), is offering €180,000,000 in aggregate principal
amount of its % senior notes due 2025 (the “Notes”). The Issuer will issue the Notes as part of the financing for the direct and indirect acquisition (the
“Acquisition”) by the direct subsidiary of the Issuer of substantially all the outstanding shares issued by Financière Gaillon 0 S.A.S. (the “Target”), the acquisition or
refinancing of other securities issued by the Target, as well as the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of the Target’s subsidiaries.

The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes at a rate of % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each and, commencing on, 2017.
The Notes will mature on, 2025. Prior to, 2020, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium.
Prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity
offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum, provided that at least 60% of the original principal amount of the Notes remains
outstanding. At any time on or after, 2020, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum.
In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (including accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any) upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events
constituting a change of control, each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a
specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event.

Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date (as defined
herein), deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering (as defined herein) into an escrow account for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The release of escrow
proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition pursuant to the terms of the FG Acquisition
Agreement (as defined herein) promptly following the release of the funds from the escrow account. The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance by the French Ministère de l’Economie, de l’Industrie et du Numérique and antitrust clearance in certain
jurisdictions, and the performance of certain closing actions. If the conditions to the release of escrow proceeds have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow
Longstop Date (as defined herein) or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special
mandatory redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, such special mandatory redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.”_


The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by BidCo on the Issue Date and by each Post-Completion Date Guarantor (as defined herein) within
120 days from the Acquisition Completion Date. The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer.

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by a first-ranking pledge over the escrow account in which the gross proceeds of the Offering will be deposited and
the rights of the Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement (as defined herein), by a first-ranking pledge over the share capital of the Issuer and by a second-ranking
pledge over the shares in BidCo held by the Issuer (the “Issue Date Collateral”). On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by a second-ranking
pledge over the receivables owed to the Issuer by BidCo in respect of any proceeds loan pursuant to which the proceeds from the Offering are provided by the
Issuer to BidCo (the “Completion Date Collateral” and together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”). The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees
(as defined herein) and the Collateral will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_


There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The Channel Islands Securities Exchange Authority Limited (the “Exchange”) for the
listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.

**Investing in the Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32.**


**Issue Price of the Notes:** **% plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**


**The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities**
**Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and are being offered and sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in**
**reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.**
**Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes may be relying on the exemption**
**from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Notes are not transferable except in accordance with the**
**restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions.”**

The Notes will be in registered form and will initially be issued in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and will only be
transferable in minimum principal amounts of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be represented on issue by one or more
Global Notes (as defined herein), which we expect will be delivered through Euroclear SA/VA (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme
(“Clearstream”) on or around, 2017 (the “Issue Date”).

countries), plans, projects to enhance efficiency, impact of governmental regulations or actions,
litigation outcomes and timetables, future capital expenditures, liquidity requirements, the
successful integration of acquisitions and joint ventures into our Group, and objectives of
management for future operations, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. When
used in this Offering Memorandum, the words “believe,” “anticipate,” “should,” “intend,”
“plan,” “will,” “expect,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “strategy” and similar expressions identify
these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or
achievements or industry results to be materially different from those contemplated, projected,
forecasted, estimated or budgeted, whether expressed or implied, by these forward-looking
statements. These factors include those set forth in the section of this Offering Memorandum
captioned “Risk Factors,” which include, among others:

- price regulation that may be affected by efforts to reduce government spending on healthcare;

- continued weakness in economic conditions;

- our corporate structure and the manner in which we exercise control over the operations of
certain of our French subsidiaries due to regulatory constraints;

- legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities;

- the dependence of our Central Lab business on the pharmaceutical industry;

- failure to establish and comply with appropriate quality standards in the provision of our
testing services;

- the execution of our growth strategy through the acquisition of other businesses;

- our ability to integrate acquired businesses and realize planned synergy benefits;

- uncertainty with respect to the amount and the timeframe for synergies and other benefits
expected to be realized from the Acquisition;

- our dependence on our senior management team;

- difficulty in recruiting specialized clinical pathologists;

- the competitive environment in which we operate;

- the internalization of testing by hospitals and regional laboratory hubs, as well as the
development of new, more cost effective tests that can be directly performed by the customers
of our Specialized Testing business;

- failures of our information technology systems;

- failure to timely or accurately bill for our services;

- financial difficulties of our clients or third party payers requiring us to write off bad debts;

- the volatile nature of our Central Lab backlog;

- failure to comply with and liabilities arising under environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations;

- disruption, failure or unsuitable delivery of sample transportation services;

- our dependence on our facility in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France;

- failure to comply with privacy laws and information security policies;

- our exposure to risks related to litigation;

- our exposure to liabilities not covered by our insurance policies;

- labor disruptions and negotiation of collective bargaining agreements;

- our reliance on the operating companies of our Group, some of which we do not control, for
revenues to make payments on the Notes or the Guarantees;

- our significant leverage, which may make it difficult to operate our businesses;

- the covenants contained in the Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, which
limit our operating and financial flexibility;

- fluctuations in interest rates; and

- other risks associated with the Acquisition, our financing, the Notes and our structure discussed
under “Risk Factors.”

The risks included herein are not exhaustive. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible
for us to predict all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place
undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering
Memorandum to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in factors affecting
these statements.

# Presentation of Financial and Other Information

#### Presentation of Financial Information

The Issuer was incorporated on January 13, 2017 for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions
(as defined herein) and performing certain activities related thereto. Substantially the entire
share capital of the Target, an indirect parent company of Cerba HealthCare, will be sold to
BidCo, which is the direct subsidiary of the Issuer, on the Acquisition Completion Date in
connection with the Transactions and, as part of the Post-Completion Mergers, Cerba HealthCare
will be merged into BidCo. The Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities
of its own and does not have any business operations, material assets or liabilities other than
those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Indebtedness—The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies_
_that have no revenue-generating operations of their own and will depend on cash from the_
_operating companies of our Group to be able to make payments on the Notes or the_
_Guarantees.” Consequently, only limited historical financial information relating to the Issuer is_
available, and no financial information with respect to the Issuer is included in this Offering
Memorandum, except for certain limited “as adjusted” financial data presented on a
consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions. All historical financial
information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of Cerba HealthCare and its
consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,”
“our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum
are to Cerba HealthCare and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The historical financial
information provided in this Offering Memorandum does not include the Target and certain
other intermediate holding companies above Cerba HealthCare.

The existing intermediate holding companies above Cerba HealthCare (i.e., Cerberus Nightingale
1 (the “Existing Senior Notes Issuer”), Cerberus Nightingale 2 and Financière Gaillon 13) are
holding companies with no revenue generating activities of their own and do not engage in any
activities other than those relating to holding the shares of their subsidiaries. The only assets of
Cerba HealthCare, the Existing Senior Notes Issuer, Cerberus Nightingale 2 and Financière Gaillon
13 are the shares in their subsidiaries, Cerberus Nightingale 2, Financière Gaillon 13, Cerba
Healthcare and Cefid S.A., respectively, and de minimis cash. Except for the Existing Senior
Secured Notes issued by Cerba HealthCare and the Existing Senior Notes issued by the Existing
Senior Notes Issuer, the only liabilities of Cerba Healthcare, the Existing Senior Notes Issuer,
Cerberus Nightingale 2 and Financière Gaillon 13 are debt owed to their direct parent entities.
On an unconsolidated basis, Cerba HealthCare, the Existing Senior Notes Issuer, Cerberus
Nightingale 2 and Financière Gaillon 13 have historically experienced losses. Following the PostCompletion Mergers, Cerba HealthCare, the Existing Senior Notes Issuer, Cerberus Nightingale 2
and Financière Gaillon 13 will merge into BidCo.

This Offering Memorandum includes the following financial information:

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Cerba HealthCare as of, and for the year
ended, December 31, 2014, prepared in accordance with IFRS;

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Cerba HealthCare as of, and for the year
ended, December 31, 2015, prepared in accordance with IFRS; and

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Cerba HealthCare as of, and for the year
ended, December 31, 2016, prepared in accordance with IFRS.

In the future, we will report consolidated financial statements and other information for the
Issuer and its subsidiaries prepared under IFRS, although we intend to also provide certain
financial information about Cerba HealthCare in order to facilitate the analysis of our financial
performance for the periods ending prior to January 1, 2019. The fiscal year of the Issuer ends on
December 31 of each calendar year and the first annual consolidated financial statements for the

xi


-----

Issuer will be available in respect of the year ended December 31, 2018. The consolidated
financial statements of Cerba HealthCare in this Offering Memorandum have not been adjusted
to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statements, balance sheets or cash flow
statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a
result of the Transactions. However, the Issuer will account for the Acquisition using the purchase
method of accounting under IFRS and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection
with the Transactions to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the
Acquisition Completion Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different
carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance sheet, which may include
intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and
depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial
statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be
comparable to Cerba HealthCare’s consolidated financial statements included in this Offering
Memorandum. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements.”_

The Acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under IFRS 3
“Business Combinations,” the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets
transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair
value of any asset or liability incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expressed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair
market values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair
value of the acquirer’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Since
the Acquisition has not been consummated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we
have not identified the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities to be assumed at the date of
the Acquisition. In accordance with IFRS, we have up to twelve months from the Acquisition
Completion Date to finalize the allocation of the purchase price.

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data
presented in millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject
to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum
may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and amounts
reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are
calculated using the numerical data in our consolidated financial statements or the tabular
presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this Offering Memorandum, as
applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

#### Pro Forma Financial Information

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2016, adjusted to give effect to the nine companies
that we acquired between January 1, 2016 and February 10, 2017 and the one company that we
have agreed to acquire (pursuant to a letter of intent signed in 2016), as if such acquisitions had
completed on January 1, 2016, and estimated cost savings and synergies from these and the two
prior years’ acquisitions on an annual run rate basis and to eliminate the transaction and
restructuring costs associated with such acquisitions (collectively, the “Pro Forma Financial
Information”). The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and does not represent what our actual results would have been had such
acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2016, nor does it purport to project our results of operation
at any future date. The Pro Forma Financial Information included in this Offering Memorandum
has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S.
Securities Act, IFRS or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Neither the adjustments nor

xii


-----

the resulting Pro Forma Financial Information have been audited in accordance with French
generally accepted accounting standards, International Accounting Standards or U.S. generally
accepted accounting standards. In evaluating the Pro Forma Financial Information, you should
carefully consider our audited historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum.

The Pro Forma Financial Information is based upon available information and assumptions that
we believe are reasonable but are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have
actually been achieved if the acquisitions had been completed on the dates indicated, or
indicative of the results that may be achieved in the future. The Pro Forma Financial Information
is provided for information purposes only.

#### Non-IFRS Financial Measures

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, including EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and certain coverage ratios that are not
required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. Such measures and ratios may not reflect
accurately our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur debt and should not be considered as
alternatives to operating income/(loss) or profit/(loss) or any other performance measures derived
from or in accordance with IFRS, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting
principles or as alternatives to net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities. The financial
information contained in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the
reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. As used in this
Offering Memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings:

EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 represents operating income/
(loss) plus the income statement line items for net change in depreciation and amortization,
and goodwill impairment. We present EBITDA including profit (loss) attributable to
non-controlling interests.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for certain items, either positive or negative,
which our management considers to be non-recurring in nature as well as certain non-cash
items that management does not consider to be representative of the underlying
performance of the business, including:

  - expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions completed during the period (advisory
fees and other one off items) and restructurings, as well as all costs, fees and other
expenses incurred in connection with share capital increases or new indebtedness;

  - certain non-recurring litigation costs;

  - other non-cash items such as movement in pension and other provisions; and

  - certain accounting adjustments.

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the full
period effect on our EBITDA from the nine companies that we acquired between January 1,
2016 and February 10, 2017 and the one company that we have agreed to acquire (pursuant
to a letter of intent signed in 2016), as if such acquisitions had been completed on January 1,
2016, estimated cost savings and synergies from these and the two prior years’ acquisitions
on an annual run rate basis and an elimination of the transaction and restructuring costs
associated with such acquisitions. See “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and
_Other Information—Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy estimates, among others, relating to cost
reductions and other benefits expected to arise from the nine companies that we acquired

xiii


-----

between January 1, 2016 and February 10, 2017 and the one company that we have agreed to
acquire (pursuant to a letter of intent signed in 2016), and acquisitions completed in the two
prior years, as well as adjustments for related costs to implement these acquisitions. The
estimates present the expected future impact of these transactions and the integration of these
companies into our existing business on a run-rate basis. Such estimates are based on a number
of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s
judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the synergies arising
from these acquisitions are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant
business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates.

We present Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for informational purposes only.
This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the
acquisitions or other transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates
indicated. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring
will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The
calculations for Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on various
assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives), management
estimates and the unaudited management accounts of the acquired businesses. These amounts
have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent
accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give
an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired
businesses or other transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our
consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.

We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they
are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt.
These measures are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be
considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any
other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA and its variants as
presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from similarly titled measures used by other
companies and from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in the sections entitled “Description of
_the Notes” of this Offering Memorandum and in the Indenture. For a reconciliation of EBITDA,_
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss), see “Summary—
_Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

We also present net sales on a like-for-like basis, which we calculate as the variation of net sales
generated in any two subsequent years within a perimeter of locations as of January 1 of the first
of these two years. This approach results in a growing like-for-like portfolio over time and does
not allow for like-for-like comparison across all periods presented in this Offering Memorandum.
These like-for-like figures may deviate from the presentation of organic growth in our historic
and future financial reporting, which is computed on a dynamic basis, comparing against the
perimeter at the end of the relevant prior-year period. Like-for-like net sales are prepared by our
management and provide a useful measure of our ongoing organic performance but are not
included in our historical financial information or prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported
under IFRS. Some of the limitations of each of these non-IFRS measures are:

- they do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;

xiv


-----

- they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments, on indebtedness;

- they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated
and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and

- other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA differently than as presented in this Offering
Memorandum, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and the
related ratios presented throughout this Offering Memorandum should not be considered as
measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or reduce indebtedness.

#### As Adjusted Financial Information

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain as adjusted financial information for the Issuer,
which is based on the consolidated financial information for Cerba HealthCare, on an as adjusted
basis to reflect certain effects of the Transactions on the indebtedness, cash position and interest
expense of the Issuer as of and for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016. See
“Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and
_Operating Data.” This as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative_
purposes only and does not represent what our actual interest expense would have been had the
Offering occurred on January 1, 2016 or what our actual cash position or indebtedness would
have been had the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2016, nor does it purport to project
our indebtedness, cash position or interest expense at any future date. The adjusted financial
information has not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statement,
balance sheet or cash flow statement that might occur as a result of application of the
acquisition method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the comparability of the Issuer’s
future consolidated financial statements with the combined financial statements contained in
this Offering Memorandum. The as adjusted financial information has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus
Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying
the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting adjusted financial information have been audited or
reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

The contents of any website, including the websites of the Sponsors, Cerba HealthCare or any
member of the Group, do not form any part of this Offering Memorandum.

# Industry and Market Information

Unless otherwise expressly indicated or noted below, all information regarding markets, market
size, market share, market position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to our
business contained in this Offering Memorandum is based on estimates prepared by us based on
certain assumptions and our knowledge of the industry in which we operate, as well as data
from various market research publications, publicly available information and industry
publications, including reports published by various third-party sources. Industry publications
generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be
reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have
not independently verified such data. We use a combination of data provided by the French
Court of Audit (Cour des Comptes), the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic
Studies (INSEE), the Directorate for Research, Studies, Assessments and Statistics (DREES), the
French National Health Insurance Fund (CNAMTS) for the French market, the Belgian National
Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (INAMI) for the Belgian market, the Statistics Portal
of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the Luxembourg market and other industry sources.

In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade
associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate market related analysis and
estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding the industry
in which we operate, our position in the industry, our market share and the market shares of
various industry participants based on experience, our own investigation of market conditions
and our review of industry publications, including information made available to the public by
our competitors. While we have examined and relied upon certain market or other industry data
from external sources as the basis for our estimates, including an industry report prepared by a
major third party consulting firm, which was commissioned by Cerba HealthCare in connection
with the sale process resulting in the Acquisition, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have
verified that data independently. We and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you of the accuracy
and completeness of, and take no responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while we believe our
internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent
source and we and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you as to their accuracy. Our estimates
involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including
those discussed under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”

Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained
therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and
completeness of such information is not guaranteed. Where we have found information from
different sources to be conflicting, we have used the information that we believe to be the most
accurate and prepared on a basis consistent with the other sources we have used.

France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the UAE, our Routine Lab operations perform a wide variety
of clinical tests (including blood chemistry analyses, urinalyses, blood cell counts and

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,396 full-time equivalent employees and we
employed approximately 415 clinical pathologists. Over the course of our history, we have
developed our business through strategic acquisitions of regional laboratories, such as our
acquisitions of JS Bio, Cerballiance Provence, Cerballiance Hauts-de-France, Cerballiance Réunion
and Novescia, as well as through selective purchases of larger testing platforms for access to new
markets, such as our acquisitions of a majority stake in Menalabs in the United Arab Emirates in
2016, LLAM in Luxembourg in 2011 and BARC in Belgium in 2007.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated total net sales of €634.1 million. Over the
same period, our Routine Lab business generated net sales of €385.8 million (60.9% of our total
net sales), our Specialized Testing business generated net sales of €179.3 million (28.3% of our
total net sales) and our Central Lab business generated net sales of €25.0 million (3.9% of our
total net sales), each prior to elimination of intercompany sales, which accounted for negative
€26.7 million and included €0.7 million of net sales generated by our operations in the United
Arab Emirates. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of €145.5 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
of €161.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Summary—Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

#### Our Competitive Strengths

Our business benefits from a number of competitive strengths, including:

**_Integrated, Efficient and Diversified Business Model_**

We operate an integrated, efficient and diversified business model based on strong and
recognized medical expertise, as well as proven industrial and organizational know how. Our
reputation for scientific excellence, inherited from our historical specialty business founded in
1967 in France as well as our Central Lab business founded in 1985 in Belgium, benefits the entire
organization through cross selling, cost synergies, training, technical support and sharing of best
practices, as well as quicker and easier access to technology and to top-trained clinical
pathologists. We believe our reputation for scientific excellence is particularly valuable to our
Specialized Testing and Central Lab businesses and is a significant strength as we look to
continue taking part in the consolidation of the routine lab market. Our reputation boosts our
credibility as a market consolidator. Through its link with the medical and pharmaceutical
communities, our Central Lab business provides us with insights into new clinical pathology tests
being developed in the industry. The strong medical expertise of our Group and its exposure to
rare pathologies also help attract and retain top-trained clinical pathologists. We believe our
Central Lab business leverages our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing infrastructure, equipment
and clinical pathologists to perform safe and cost effective testing of new drugs, thereby
generating significant cost synergies.

Our business model also benefits from our strong experience in managing large scale technical
and logistical networks, which allows us not only to expand our different businesses organically
and geographically, but also to optimize internal synergies between them. In particular, our
strong logistics expertise, based on outsourced operations managed by in-house experts, allows
us to optimize our size and organization in a cost and operationally effective way.

Our presence across all segments of the industry also allows us to benefit from the entire life
cycle of a test, from its early and confidential use, as part of a drug trial in Central Lab, to its
more common use in Specialized Testing through to its massive dissemination as a routine test.
Finally, our integrated business model has allowed us to better absorb pricing pressures and
improve profitability by negotiating more advantageous purchasing conditions with our reagent
and equipment suppliers. We regularly invest in the latest technological advances in our field and
are able to attract and retain leading clinical pathologists.

**_Leading Market Positions Across Routine, Specialty and Central Lab Testing_**

We are the only clinical pathology laboratory in Europe with leading market positions in all its
European geographies and across all three segments of the clinical laboratory services industry
based on revenue. We believe that we are the largest private network of clinical pathology
laboratories in France in terms of 2016 run-rate revenues, one of the two national scale networks
and one of the top four private players in Europe by net sales, based on management estimates.
We also believe that, based on management estimates for 2016, we were among the three
largest private providers of routine testing in Belgium and the largest private ambulatory care
routine laboratories in Luxembourg. In Specialized Testing, our historical core business, we
believe that we were co-leader of the market in France based on management estimates for
2016, with customers in more than 50 countries across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.
Finally, we believe we are a significant player in the Central Lab market worldwide, based on
management estimates for 2016. Our position in the three segments in which we operate enables
us to attract top-trained clinical pathologists and to be at the forefront of both technological and
medical advancements in the clinical pathology industry as a result of our close relationships with
the medical and scientific communities. Our position as a leader has made us a key player in the
consolidation of the routine market.

We believe we offer one of the largest catalogs of routine and specialized clinical tests in Europe,
with over 2,500 tests as of December 31, 2016, of which approximately 1,500 are highly
specialized in molecular clinical pathology, immunology, cellular clinical pathology, bacteriology,
hormonology, oncology and rare biochemistry. As of December 31, 2016, we employed
approximately 415 clinical pathologists who perform and interpret clinical tests processed on our
technical platforms and assist external clinical pathologists and doctors in their diagnostics.

**_Resilient and Growing Market Underpinned by Strong Fundamentals and Further_**
**_Growth Opportunities_**

The European clinical laboratory services market has been characterized by resilient growth over
the past several years, including through economic downturns, benefiting from favorable
demographic and scientific trends. The private clinical laboratory testing market in France is
estimated to have experienced approximately 2.5% compound annual growth from 2006 to
2011, reflecting the net effect of tariff decreases and the combined growth effect of volume and
mix. From 2011 to 2014 the market experienced a 0.6% average decrease in value as a
consequence of new test coefficient reductions. From 2014 onwards, the market stabilized due to
a three-year agreement capping the growth of overall testing spending at 0.25% per year from
2014 to 2016. In Belgium, the total clinical laboratory testing market experienced annual growth
between 1% and 2% since 2012, and the ambulatory biology market in Luxembourg grew at a
rate of approximately 8% per year over the last 10 years.

Past growth of the routine and specialty testing markets has been supported by strong
demographic trends in our geographical markets. Contrary to certain other European countries,
the population in France, our main market, continues to grow. In the meantime, as life
expectancy continues to increase in Europe generally, the number of people aged 60 and over
(an age from which many people request and need more medical treatments) increases too. In
addition, as birth rates remain relatively high in our markets, particularly in France, pregnant
women also generate a significant volume of medical testing.

Public health and scientific trends have also been key drivers of the growth of the routine and
specialty testing markets. As it is often less expensive to prevent a disease than to treat it,
governments have pursued policies that favor preventive care, in addition to encouraging more
accurate and sophisticated tests to facilitate early detection. We believe, based on publicly
available information, that from 2010 to 2020, the percentage of overall healthcare expenditure
worldwide dedicated to diagnosis, prediction and disease monitoring will increase from


3


-----

approximately 30% to 40%. Finally, chronic diseases, which generally require regular testing for
monitoring purposes, have increased in recent years likely due to certain lifestyle trends, such as
low levels of physical activity, malnutrition, stress and pollution.

We believe that in addition to these favorable demographic and public health fundamentals,
other trends support an increase in the volume of medical testing, and thus support the future
growth of our different markets. In particular:

- we believe that new tests will emerge as technologies develop and personalization of
prevention and treatment will become the norm, further offering growth opportunities for our
specialized testing segment; we believe that the market continues to shift progressively to
preventive care, early detection and companion diagnostics;

- we also believe that the consolidation of the routine laboratory testing market in Europe is
continuing, in particular in France, which is still fragmented, with approximately 2,195 legal
entities or approximately 3,876 collection centers as of December 2014;

- state budget reductions, as well as regulatory liberalization, create pressure to outsource
routine and specialized tests from the public sector; in 2015, revenue from the private French
clinical laboratory testing totaled approximately €4.3 billion, representing approximately 60%
of the overall French clinical laboratory testing market; and

- with respect to the central lab market, we believe that the pharmaceutical industry’s need to
market new drugs to replace aging blockbusters, as well as the further outsourcing of
pharmaceutical companies’ R&D capabilities, continues to increase demand for central lab
testing.

**_Significant Barriers to Entry_**

The European testing markets in which we operate are characterized by national regulatory and
structural specificities which make them more difficult and costly to penetrate for potential new
entrants. We believe that scientific reputation, technical capabilities, market and regulatory
knowledge, as well as critical size, all of which are characteristics of Cerba, are key elements that
will be necessary to be able to fully benefit from future growth opportunities.

We believe our Group is well known for scientific excellence and cutting edge technical knowhow. Inherited from our historical core specialty lab business founded in 1967 in France and our
central lab business founded in 1985 in Belgium, this reputation, which has allowed us to
establish strong relationships with the scientific community and to establish a renowned brand
name in the medical laboratory testing industry, constitutes an invaluable advantage over
potential new entrants, in particular in Central Lab where referral processes are long and
difficult.

We operate in a highly regulated market with stringent regulations and strict accreditation
procedures governing the granting or the renewal of a license to operate a laboratory. Securing
these mandatory accreditations entails significant investment and lengthy and complex processes
making it increasingly difficult for new entrants to penetrate the market. For example, the
existing administrative authorization process for the establishment and operation of clinical
laboratories in France will be replaced in November 2020 by a new accreditation procedure,
COFRAC accreditation, that will introduce new, stricter requirements pursuant to the ISO
standard. COFRAC accreditation is being implemented gradually and, since November 2016, 50%
of the tests performed by a laboratory already have to be accredited. We are compliant with this
requirement. In November 2018, 70% of the tests performed by a laboratory will have to be
accredited. The COFRAC accreditation process is costly and time consuming. As such, it constitutes


4


-----

a significant barrier to entry for new entrants and a significant burden for existing small labs. In
addition, the legal constraints in the French market regarding mandatory shareholding of clinical
pathologists with which we believe we already comply, constitute a significant barrier to entry
into the French routine market. The stringent price regulations applicable to the routine and
specialty markets in which we operate also constitute serious obstacles for new entrants as these
price constraints favor well established and large players who benefit from their existing
reputation and large scale to implement a cost effective model. Finally, we believe that in France,
new networks would be difficult to create as the opening of new laboratories or collection
centers requires several regulatory approvals, which are only rarely obtained as the market is
already well covered by a large number of laboratories.

We also believe that size and scale, which would be highly difficult and costly to achieve in the
short term for any new entrant, are key strengths for larger market participants like us. We
believe that larger participants, with well-established and integrated logistical capabilities, are
better equipped and positioned to treat high volume testing in a more cost effective way, to
consolidate the routine market where necessary, to secure loyalty from outsourcing (for specialty
lab) and commercial (for central lab) partners, to optimize synergies within the different testing
businesses and, finally, to seize growth opportunities in new geographical markets.

Finally, we believe that the logistics organization of our Specialized Testing business is a valuable
asset that would be difficult for new entrants to replicate. For cost and operational efficiency, we
have outsourced the operation of our logistics network to a trusted partner, which is ISO
accredited and is in charge of the collection and transportation of samples. While we have
outsourced this aspect of the logistics for our Specialized Testing Business, we maintain in-house
the management and proprietary mapping of the network. This model, as well as our strong inhouse logistics expertise and experience, allow us to collect an average of approximately 24,000
samples per day, from more than 3,000 locations worldwide, and to ensure that all tubes arrive
before 7 a.m. in our specialty laboratory in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, near Paris, France, to be tested
and the results returned to clients within 24 hours.

**_Proven Consolidation Strategy with a Structured Approach to Acquisitions_**

Founded as a specialty laboratory in 1967, we have since then expanded into new businesses and
new geographies through acquisitions. With our acquisition of BARC in 2007, we expanded into
the central laboratory testing business as well as the routine laboratory testing business in
Belgium. We have continued to expand our Routine Lab business through several strategic
acquisitions in highly populated geographic areas of France (such as Cerballiance Hauts-de-France
in the Lille metropolitan area in 2009, Cerballiance Paris (formerly CBCV) in the Paris area in 2010,
Cerballiance Provence (formerly Biotop Développement) in the Marseille area in 2010, JS Bio in
the Provence–Alpes–Côte d’Azur area in 2014 and Novescia in 2015), and Luxembourg (such as
Ketterthill Laboratories, which we acquired through our acquisition of LLAM in 2011),
complemented by a series of bolt-on acquisitions. While strategic acquisitions are more complex
and less frequent, they enable us to expand into new geographic zones, such as the acquisition
of a majority stake in Menalabs in the United Arab Emirates in 2016 and of DeltaMedica in Italy
in February 2017, or into complementary segments, such as the acquisition of Antagène S.A., a
veterinary laboratory in France, in August 2016. Significant portions of the European clinical
laboratory services market, especially the French market, remain fragmented. These markets
present opportunities for consolidation and growth. The laboratories we acquire through these
strategic acquisitions often serve as technical platforms regional clusters and perform the entire
clinical laboratory testing for the region. We complement these strategic acquisitions with
smaller bolt-on acquisitions of laboratories that we transform into collection centers where
samples are collected from patients and sent to the technical platforms for testing. Through this
regional clusterization strategy built around technical platforms, we have built a very dense
network of laboratories centered around eleven regional clusters in France, two in Belgium and
one in Luxembourg. From a single collection center in 2007, we have grown to operate


5


-----

approximately 360 collection centers with a staff of approximately 415 clinical pathologists as of
December 31, 2016. We have completed 59 acquisitions from 2009 to 2016. In the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 alone, we completed three, seven and five acquisitions,
respectively, of which respectively two, five and four were bolt-on acquisitions.

In addition, certain regulatory changes, such as the introduction of mandatory accreditation and
higher quality standards in France, generally benefit larger laboratory companies or networks
like ours. Since 2007, we have been an active consolidator in the routine lab market, and we
believe we are well positioned to capitalize on additional opportunities in France as well as in
potential new markets. We have a dedicated team of four professionals focused on finding,
evaluating and executing external growth opportunities and have developed a structured
approach to acquisitions that capitalizes on the expertise and market knowledge of our senior
management and local laboratory doctors. The laboratory companies we acquire are often clients
or competitors of ours with whom we have had prior business interaction. This in-depth
knowledge of the industry helps us pre-select suitable acquisition targets. Our track record
demonstrates a disciplined approach to acquisitions, including the setting of internal acquisition
multiple targets and high due diligence standards, which include the participation of our senior
executives at various stages of the acquisition process. We believe that the fragmentation of the
French clinical laboratory market, together with the slow-growth economy in the past several
years, allows us to complete acquisitions of clinical laboratories at attractive prices.

Post-acquisition, we generally implement cost reduction initiatives aimed at increasing the
profitability of the clinical laboratories we acquire through economies of scale and the sharing of
best practices with the rest of the network. Historically, we have been able to extract a
substantial amount of synergies from our acquisitions. Certain synergies from bolt-on acquisitions
can be realized upon closing of the acquisition such as savings on reagent costs. We also achieve
reductions in technical and administrative expenses as we shift technical and administrative
functions to our technical platforms and redeploy the personnel of the acquired entity across our
network of technical platforms, which can be a lengthy process taking more than 24 months
after acquisition in certain cases. However, due to voluntary departures resulting from the
redeployment process of our workforce to our regional platforms, some cost reductions relating
to personnel can be quickly realized. In 2016, we have re-branded our entire network in France
under the brand Cerballiance to develop the reputation of the Group, introduce the new brand
to all clients and unite the employees around our brand.

**_Track Record of a Strong and Sustained Financial Performance, with High Margin and_**
**_Strong Cash Flow Generation_**

We have demonstrated sustained net sales compound annual growth of 18.2% between the year
ended December 31, 2009 (predecessor of Cerba HealthCare) and the year ended December 31,
2016. This sales growth has been underpinned by our acquisition strategy as we have sought to
increase our market share in the Routine Lab testing market.

Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2016 increased from
22.7% to 23.0%, demonstrating our ability to rapidly integrate acquired companies, realize
synergies and gain greater operating leverage through our increased scale. We have developed
and are implementing numerous cost initiatives that allow us to further control our costs by
optimizing our relationships with our suppliers, our logistics operations and our information
technology systems. This disciplined investment and cost control strategy has allowed us to
achieve a significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA margins over the years.

Finally, our business benefits from relatively low capital expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and
working capital requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, our net
capital expenditures (excluding asset acquisitions), were €9.5 million, €23.0 million and
€22.8 million, respectively. As a percentage of our net sales, capital expenditure (excluding asset


6


-----

acquisitions) amounted to 2.4%, 4.1% and 3.6% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015
and 2016, respectively. Due to this favorable business model, we were able to generate strong
cash flow as reflected by our cash conversion rate of 89.5% for 2014, 79.7% for 2015 and 84.3%
for 2016 (cash conversion rate, expressed as a percentage, is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus
capital expenditure (excluding asset acquisitions), divided by Adjusted EBITDA), generating the
capacity to de-lever while continuing to support our acquisition strategy.

**_Well_** **_Regarded and_** **_Experienced Management Team_** **_at_** **_Group Level and Unique_**
**_Governance and Ownership Structure at Operational Level_**

We benefit from the experience and industry know how of our current senior management
team. In particular, Catherine Rondot Courboillet, our CEO and a highly regarded industry
specialist in Europe, Jérôme Thill, our deputy CEO, Sylvie Cado, head of our Specialized Testing
business, Philippe Buhl, head of our Routine Labs in France and Cyril Dubreuil, our sales and
business development director, each of whom has more than eight years of experience in the
industry. Our management team has an average of 20 years’ industry experience and an average
of 16 years’ experience in the Group.

Moreover, our ownership model is based on a strong entrepreneurial culture, where more than
100 laboratory doctors and managers are shareholders of our structure, at our holding company
level and at the different operating laboratories levels. Our ownership model and structure gives
us overall strategic control, while also incentivizing doctors and managers to fully contribute to a
common commercial, scientific and industrial project and greatly rewarding commitment,
development and innovation. For example, in 2013, we were the first medical lab to bring highly
innovative non-invasive pre-natal testing to market in Europe. We believe that our ownership
structure is key to the strength and success of our model.

Following completion of the Acquisition, we also expect our business to benefit from the market
expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our future shareholders, Partners
Group and PSP Investments.

#### Our Strategy

Based in particular on our strong scientific reputation and expertise, our strategy mainly consists
of becoming a leading network in the French routine lab market through consolidation, while
maintaining our unique positioning in the European specialty and central lab businesses. The key
elements of our strategy are:

**_Drive Organic Volume Growth Across Our Business Segments_**

The core of our Group’s strategy consists of developing organically each of our different business
segments through coordinated but tailored action plans.

With respect to our Routine Lab business, our strategy encompasses operational and functional
alignment between our regional clusters, which is facilitated by the deployment of a dedicated
team. These alignment efforts include the standardization of our routine industrial processes
with respect to technical platform operations, quality assurance and information systems. The
dedicated team in charge of this integration strategy also focuses on improving the management
of our routine staff and the organization of our networks. We are also further developing our
retail strategy through relocation of our laboratories into new, more attractive or convenient
locations, and a rebranding of our entire network in France under the Cerballiance brand. Our
strategy with respect to the organic growth of our Routine Lab business includes the selection of
those of our youngest laboratory doctors with the most promising managerial capabilities; we
will provide them with high quality business school training, with the aim of further improving
the management of our laboratories at the local level. Finally, we have a dedicated team of key
account managers focusing on accelerating the penetration of and recruitment of key customers,


7


-----

such as public hospitals and retirement homes, through partnerships. While such partnerships are
time consuming and expensive to negotiate, due to reasons such as national referencing, site by
site negotiations and entry costs, they offer attractive long-term contracts with secured high
volumes.

In the Specialized Testing market, we are committed first to maintaining our leadership through
the renewal of our catalog of tests, the acceleration of compliance with new ISO regulations and
the improvement of our logistics services, in particular at the international level. We intend to
continue to particularly focus our efforts on profitable organic growth driven mainly by new
tests and, to a lesser degree, by the expansion of our international activity. As a result, we aim to
innovate through new technologies, new tests and enhanced services for customers through
partnerships with hospitals and biotech companies, and through the work of our scientific and
medical committee. We also believe that the combination of our scientific and logistics expertise
positions us well to benefit from future national screening campaigns and epidemics testing. We
also aim to further expand our export activity, leveraging our reputation and logistics capabilities
to reach more customers, including in selective new geographical markets. Our focus on
profitable organic growth also implies the further development of synergies between our
Specialized Testing business and our Central Lab activities, in particular through biomarkers
innovations. Finally, we intend to further foster the general profitability of our Specialized
Testing business, including through the further automation of our processes (such as invoicing
and samples encoding) and the better optimization of new regulations.
Finally, we intend to continue developing our Central Lab business through the further
differentiation of the positioning of BARC. In particular, we aim at capturing organic growth
opportunities of our Central Lab business by broadening our product selection from safety to
tailor made biomarkers and leveraging our strong scientific knowledge and capabilities as well as
our proven specialist approach implemented by a unique team of clinical pathologists, including
through the co-development of new tests with clients. We also intend to further develop our
Central Lab business by further strengthening our position in Europe and Africa, working to
establish a position in Asia, improving client services and adaptability including through price
transparency and competitiveness, strengthening our pure testing player approach (that is, our
ability to intervene in all clinical trial phases) and continuing our certification program and our
tailor made reporting approach. Finally, we intend to further strengthen our worldwide lab
networks to capture new contracts and expand our customer base.

**_Selectively Pursue Acquisitions_**
In the French routine lab market, we are organized in eleven regional clusters, which we intend
to expand further. In regions where we are already present, our expansion strategy will include
selected small- and mid-size bolt-on acquisitions that fit into and complement the existing local
networks organized around technical platforms, similar to the acquisition of JS Bio in 2014. To
expand into new regions, we intend to pursue acquisitions of existing regional clusters followed
by further bolt-on acquisitions in line with our clusterization strategy but also to implement
more significant strategic transactions with larger players, such as the acquisition of Novescia in
2015 or Menalabs in 2016. Our strategic focus will be to pursue bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen
and increase our local market share and the density of our regional network. As in the past, we
aim to generate immediate synergies from bolt-on acquisitions by transforming the acquired
small laboratories into collection centers that feed samples to a technical platform where test
analysis is centralized.

In the past, we completed a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our geographical
coverage and gain critical mass in markets outside France. Although our acquisition strategy is
currently focused on the French routine market, we may explore opportunities to purchase larger
laboratory networks in other European countries or to pursue bolt-on acquisitions in regions
adjacent to the markets where we currently operate. As such, our focus will be on regions with
growing and aging populations as well as regions with greater per capita spending on healthcare
services.

-----

Finally, expansion into additional business segments will be another important growth driver for
us in the coming years. We aim to become a national player in the veterinary laboratory market
in France through leveraging our large network of collection centers. We have acquired a second
veterinary laboratory in France in 2016 to further expand our service offering.

**_Continue to Deliver Operating Efficiencies_**

We also intend to continue to take advantage of the economies of scale provided by our
presence in all three segments of the laboratory testing market and by the size of our network to
streamline our operations and administrative functions and to control costs. We are aiming in
particular at controlling costs through the further rationalization of our network (in particular in
France by establishing technical platforms surrounded by a sophisticated and condensed network
of collection centers), the further industrialization and automation of our processes and the
optimization of synergies between our segments and geographies. We also intend to continue
leveraging our size to obtain favorable commercial conditions from suppliers. In cooperation
with our main logistical partners, we are continuing to improve our logistical organization and
optimize samples collection and transportation, seeking logistical synergies between our national
and international activities and between our three business segments. Finally, we continuously
work on the further integration of our laboratories, in particular with respect to those acquired
most recently. In particular, we will seek to optimize our operating costs through the
implementation of group agreements and processes with respect to IT, cars, rentals, external fees
and utilities.

#### The Transactions

**_The Acquisition_**
On February 8, 2017, BidCo, an entity indirectly owned by the Sponsors, entered into the FG
Acquisition Agreement to acquire from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding share capital
of the Target and the Sellers’ Bonds. Prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, BidCo will enter
into the Manco Acquisition Agreement to acquire at least 96% of the issued and outstanding
share capital of Manco from certain managers of the Group. We currently expect the Acquisition
to complete at the end of April 2017. The consummation of the Acquisition is, however, subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance by the French Ministère de
_l’Economie, de l’Industrie et du Numérique and antitrust clearance in certain jurisdictions, and_
the performance of certain closing actions. Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreements,
BidCo has agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the required clearances following the
signing of the Acquisition Agreements. If these conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the
Acquisition Longstop Date, and such date has not been extended by the parties, the Acquisition
Agreements may be terminated.

The Acquisition Agreements contain customary warranties and indemnities given by the Sellers as
to capacity, title and certain disclosure matters as well as customary covenants given by the
Sellers regarding, among other things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of the Group
pending closing of the Acquisition. The Sellers’ liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to
certain thresholds and limitations. The FG Acquisition Agreement includes a feature whereby the
purchase price will increase with the time period that elapses until the Acquisition Completion
Date. As a result, the ultimate purchase price will be dependent on the timing of the Acquisition
Completion Date.

The Issuer, the direct parent of BidCo, holds 100% of the share capital of BidCo. Each of BidCo
and the Issuer is a société par actions simplifiée incorporated and existing under the laws of
France. BidCo and the Issuer are indirectly owned and controlled by the Sponsors, and were
incorporated by affiliates of the Sponsors as acquisition vehicles for the Transactions. Neither
BidCo nor the Issuer has any business operations or material assets or liabilities other than those
incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions.

**_The Financing and Equity Contribution_**
The consummation of the Acquisition (including the repayment or satisfaction and discharge of
certain existing indebtedness owed by the Target and certain of its subsidiaries, as well as
estimated transaction fees and expenses) is expected to require an aggregate of €1,761.4 million
in debt and equity financing.

The Acquisition and the related transaction fees and expenses will be financed through (i) (A) the
issuance of the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of €180.0 million and (B) a drawing
under the Senior Term Loan in the amount of €794.0 million ((A) and (B) collectively, the
“Financing”) and (ii) (X) €743.3 million of cash funding to be provided by the Sponsors to the
Issuer indirectly through UK TopCo by way of equity contributions (approximately €10.0 million
of which will be reserved for future management participation in the Group pursuant to a
management equity participation program) and (Y) €44.1 million of equity contribution by
certain managers of the Group in the Issuer of all or part of their existing investments in Manco,
indirectly through TopCo ((X) and (Y) collectively, the “Equity Contribution”). The Issuer will
advance the proceeds of the Offering to BidCo by way of a proceeds loan (the “BidCo Proceeds
Loan”) and contribute the proceeds from the Equity Contribution to BidCo.

The proceeds of the Financing and the Equity Contribution will be used as further described
under “—Sources and Uses of the Transactions.” We refer to the application of the proceeds of
the Financing and Equity Contribution to the redemption of the Existing Notes and repayment of

certain other existing indebtedness, including certain financial securities issued by the Target, as
the “Refinancing.” We refer to the Acquisition and the Refinancing collectively as the
“Transactions.” See “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Description of Other Indebtedness,”
“Description of the Notes.”

**_Escrow Account_**
Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross
proceeds from the Offering into the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer. The Escrow
Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and will be pledged on a first-ranking basis in
favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.

The release of the escrow proceeds from the Escrow Account is subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition promptly following release of
the escrow proceeds from the Escrow Account. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” If these conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the_
Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject
to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price for the Notes will
be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but not including, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption.”_

Pursuant to the Shortfall Agreement, in the event of a special mandatory redemption, the Public
Sector Pension Investment Board (directly or indirectly through a wholly owned subsidiary
thereof) and one or more investment funds advised or managed by Partners Group AG will each
be required to make an equity contribution to the Issuer in such aggregate amounts as required
in order to enable the Issuer to pay any funding shortfall, including escrow account fees and
costs, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the
Notes on such special mandatory redemption date. The obligation of each of the Sponsors to
make such equity contributions will be several, and not joint, and will be made on a pro rata
basis in proportion to the Sponsors’ respective total equity commitments in UK TopCo. Under the
Shortfall Agreement, the Sponsor contribution shall be contributed, directly or indirectly, to the
capital of the Issuer for deposit into the Escrow Account. Under no circumstance may the Trustee
cause the Sponsor contribution to be paid directly to the Trustee or any other person. The rights
of the Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement will be pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of
the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.

The holders of the Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the Shortfall Agreement, and
must rely on the Issuer’s sole right to enforcement under the Shortfall Agreement. See
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition—If the conditions precedent to the release of the_
_escrow proceeds are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means_
_that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.”_

estimates of fees and expenses and the actual fees and expenses as of the completion of the various transactions referred to in
the table above, as well as the actual date on which the Acquisition Completion Date occurs. To the extent either the Notes or the
Senior Term Loan is issued with original issue discount, the amount of fees and expenses will increase.

#### Recent Developments

**_Current Trading_**
Based on management accounts for January 2017, we anticipate that our net sales and EBITDA
increased slightly compared to January 2016 on a like-for-like basis.

The foregoing information is based solely on preliminary internal information used by
management and management estimates and remains subject to our normal end-of-quarter and
end-of-year review process. As a result, this information may change. In particular, during the
course of our review process we could identify items that would require us to make adjustments,
which might be material.

(1) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Sponsors will directly or indirectly hold all of the share capital of UK TopCo, which
will indirectly hold (through wholly owned or majority owned intermediate holding companies) substantially all of the share
capital of the Target (other than the indirect shareholding being acquired by management). See “Principal Shareholders and
_Related Party Transactions.”_

(2) On the Acquisition Completion Date (i) the Sponsors will indirectly through UK TopCo provide an aggregate €743.3 million to
BidCo and (ii) certain managers of the Group will indirectly through TopCo contribute a portion of their shares in Manco (the
existing management investment vehicle of the Group) equal to €44.1 million to BidCo, in each case by way of the Equity
Contribution.

(3) The Sponsors intend to establish a management equity participation program on or after the Acquisition Completion Date,
pursuant to which certain managers who are employees of the Group may indirectly hold, through a management pooling
vehicle, a portion of the share capital of the Target. See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Management
_Equity Participation Program.”_

(4) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Issuer will advance the BidCo Proceeds Loan to BidCo.

(5) On the Acquisition Completion Date, BidCo will use the proceeds from the Equity Contribution, the BidCo Proceeds Loan and
the Senior Term Loan to (i) fund the purchase price for the Acquisition, (ii) advance the Cerba Proceeds Loans to Cerba HealthCare
(in the amount of approximately €783.1 million) and Cerba Selafa (in the amount of approximately €65 million) for repayment of
certain existing indebtedness of the Group pursuant to the Refinancing and (iii) pay transaction fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions. The Cerba Proceeds Loan made to Cerba HealthCare will be extinguished in connection with
the Post-Completion Merger 5.

(6) The Notes will be general, senior obligations of the Issuer. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by first- and secondranking security interests in the Issue Date Collateral, as applicable. On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will be
secured by second-ranking security interests in the Completion Date Collateral. For a description of the Collateral, see “The
_Offering.” On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by BidCo. Within 120 days from the_
Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will also be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Post-Completion Date
Guarantors. The laws of certain jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized limit the amount of obligations that may be
guaranteed, or in respect of which security interests may be provided as well as the enforceability of Guarantees and the rights to
the security securing the Notes and the Guarantees. For more information on limitations to the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of the Guarantors and security provider, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

(7) The Senior Credit Facilities provide for aggregate borrowings of up to €969.0 million (equivalent) in the form of a Senior Term
Loan in an aggregate principal amount of €794.0 million and a Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of
€175.0 million. The Post-Completion Date Guarantors will guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities on a senior basis. See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

(8) Upon consummation of the Post-Completion Mergers, Manco, the Target and certain intermediate holding companies
between the Target and Cefid (i.e., Cerba HealthCare, the Existing Senior Notes Issuer, Cerberus Nightingale 2 and Financière
Gaillon 13) will merge into BidCo, after which Cefid will be directly and wholly owned by BidCo.

(9) The Post-Completion Date Guarantors will be CERBA Selafa, LLAM S.A., Cerballiance Provence, Cerballiance Paris Sud,
Cerballiance Paris, Cerballiance Côte d’Azur and Cerballiance Rhône Alpes. The Post-Completion Date Guarantors accounted for
76.7% of our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, and held 64.4% of our total assets (excluding goodwill, equity
investments in subsidiaries and intercompany transactions) as of December 31, 2016. The subsidiaries of Cerba HealthCare that
will not guarantee the Notes accounted for 23.3% of our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, and held 35.6% of our
total assets (excluding goodwill, equity investments in subsidiaries and intercompany transactions) as of December 31, 2016. As of
December 31, 2016, our subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Notes had total debt, when excluding shareholder debt, the Existing
Notes and the Sellers’ Bonds (each of which we expect to repay as part of the Transactions) and intercompany loans, of €35.3
million.

(10) Restrictions imposed on the ownership of each of our French laboratory subsidiaries by French law limit (i) persons who are
not clinical pathologists and entities that are not laboratory companies from holding more than 25% of a laboratory company’s
share capital and (ii) external clinical pathologists and entities that are laboratory companies from holding more than 49.9% of
the voting rights in a laboratory company. We hold our French laboratory companies indirectly through Cefid. Cefid holds the
statutory maximum of 25% of the share capital of Cerba Selafa. However, the by-laws of Cerba Selafa allow Cefid to hold 99.96%
of its financial rights (i.e., the rights to receive dividends and other distributions). Cerba Selafa, as a laboratory company, holds,
directly or indirectly, approximately the statutory maximum of 49.9% of the voting rights in Cerballiance Provence, Cerballiance
Pyrénées, Cerballiance Côtes d’Armor, Cerballiance Paris, Cerballiance Normandie and Cerballiance Somme, and approximately
46% of the voting rights in Cerballiance Réunion and Cerballiance Hauts-de-France. Cerba Selafa holds between approximately
70% and 99.99% of the financial rights in each of Cerballiance Provence, Cerballiance Hauts-de-France, Cerballiance Pyrénées,
Cerballiance Réunion, Cerballiance Côtes d’Armor, Cerballiance Normandie, Cerballiance Paris and Cerballiance Somme. The
clinical pathologists at each of our French laboratory subsidiary companies hold the remainder of the voting rights and financial
rights. For companies set up after May 31, 2013, in France, law n° 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 requires that the ownership of
more than 50% of their share capital and voting rights must be held, directly or indirectly, by clinical pathologists working within
the laboratory companies. Laboratories set up prior to May 31, 2013, do not have to comply with this requirement. For more
information on our corporate structure and the limitations imposed by French law on ownership of laboratory companies, see
“Business—Our Specific Corporate Structure” and “Regulation—Regulations Affecting Our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing
_Businesses—France.”_

(11) Each of our Belgian and Luxembourg subsidiaries is wholly owned directly or indirectly by Cerba HealthCare.

(12) On the Acquisition Completion Date, approximately €107.3 million of existing indebtedness, including finance leases and
bilateral credit agreements, will remain outstanding and not be subject to the Refinancing. See “Capitalization” and “Summary—
_The Transactions.”_

                   - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt
of such Guarantor’s subsidiaries (including obligations to

The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Guarantees will be subject to release under certain
circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—Note
_Guarantees.”_

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually
limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect
limitations under applicable law, including but not limited
to, with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate
benefit, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions
applicable to the Guarantors and their directors. In certain
cases, these limitations may apply to the Guarantees, but not
to the Guarantors’ obligations under other debt, including
the Senior Credit Facilities. See “Description of the Notes—

_The Notes Guarantees,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the_
_Notes—The Guarantees and the Security Interests over the_
_Collateral may be limited by applicable laws or subject to_
_certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect_
_their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and_
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The Post-Completion Date Guarantors accounted for 76.7%
of our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, and
held 64.4% of our total assets (excluding goodwill, equity
investments in subsidiaries and intercompany transactions) as
of December 31, 2016. The subsidiaries of Cerba HealthCare
that will not guarantee the Notes accounted for 23.3% of
our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, and held
35.6% of our total assets (excluding goodwill, equity
investments in subsidiaries and intercompany transactions) as
of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Cerba
HealthCare’s subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes
had total debt, excluding shareholder debt, the Existing
Notes and the Sellers’ Bonds (each of which we expect to
repay as part of the Transactions) and intercompany loans,
of €35.3 million. This amount would have ranked structurally
senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—The Notes will be_
_structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor_
_subsidiaries and effectively subordinated to liabilities that_
_are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes.”_

**Collateral . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by a firstranking charge over the escrow proceeds of the Offering
and the rights of the Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement, a
first-ranking pledge over the share capital of the Issuer held
by HoldCo and, a second-ranking pledge over the shares in
BidCo held by the Issuer (the “Issue Date Collateral”). On the
Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by a
second-ranking pledge over the receivables owed to the
Issuer by BidCo in respect of the BidCo Proceeds Loan (the
“Completion Date Collateral” and together with the Issue
Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under
the Senior Credit Facilities and certain hedge counterparties
will be repaid with the proceeds from any enforcement of
the Collateral in priority to the Notes. See “—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

The Security Interests in the Collateral will be subject to
certain limitations under applicable law and may be released
under certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Indebtedness.”_

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . .** The Intercreditor Agreement will set out various matters
governing the relative rights relating to the indebtedness
and obligations under the Notes and certain other existing
and future indebtedness and obligations permitted under


19


-----

the Indenture governing the Notes. Although the Notes will
be secured by certain liens on the Collateral, under the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes will
be subject to certain limitations on their ability to take
certain actions in respect of their interests in the Collateral,
including certain standstill periods relating to the Notes in
particular. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Escrow Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . . .** Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, and pending
consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of
certain other conditions, the Initial Purchasers will deposit
the gross proceeds of the Offering into an escrow account
held in the name of the Issuer (the “Escrow Account”). The
Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent, and
pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on
behalf of the holders of the Notes. Upon delivery to the
Trustee and the Escrow Agent of an officer’s certificate
stating that the conditions to the release of the proceeds
from escrow are satisfied, the escrowed proceeds will be
released to the Issuer and utilized as described in “Use of
_Proceeds” and “Description of the Notes—Escrow of_
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The release of_
the proceeds deposited on the Escrow Account will be
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the
completion of the Acquisition pursuant to the terms of the
FG Acquisition Agreement promptly following the escrow
release. If the conditions to the release of the proceeds
deposited on the Escrow Account have not been satisfied on
or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the
occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject
to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory
redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the
aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date
to, but not including, such special mandatory redemption
date.

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the
Sponsors will each be required to make an equity
contribution to the Issuer, in an amount in the aggregate
that is required to enable the Issuer to pay any funding
shortfall, including escrow account fees and costs, accrued
and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, owed
to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory
redemption date, pursuant to the Shortfall Agreement. The
obligation of each of the Sponsors to make such equity
contributions will be several, and not joint, and will be
made on a pro rata basis in proportion to the Sponsors’
respective total equity commitments in UK TopCo. The
rights of the Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement will be
pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on
behalf of the holders of the Notes. The holders of the Notes

will not have any direct right to enforce the Shortfall
Agreement, and must rely on the Issuer’s sole right to
enforcement under the Shortfall Agreement. See
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related_
_to the Acquisition—If the conditions precedent to the_
_release of the escrow proceeds are not satisfied, the Issuer_
_will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that_
_you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.”_

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . .** At any time prior to, 2020, the Issuer will be
entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the
Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, plus the
applicable “make-whole” premium.

At any time prior to, 2020, the Issuer may
redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal
amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain
equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this
Offering Memorandum, provided that, inter alia, at least
60% of the original principal amount of the Notes remains
outstanding.

At any time on or after, 2020, the Issuer may
redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set
forth in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not part, of the
Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof (including accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any) upon the occurrence of certain
changes in applicable tax law.

Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a
change of control, each holder of the Notes may require the
Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any.
However, a change of control will not be deemed to have
occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not
exceeded in connection with such event.

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . .** If a change of control occurs, the Issuer must offer to
purchase each holder’s Notes at a purchase price of 101% of
the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but excluding)
the date of purchase. However, a change of control with
respect to the Notes will not be deemed to have occurred if
a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in
connection with such event. See “Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control.”_

**Redemption for Taxation**
**Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing
jurisdiction impose certain withholding taxes or other
deductions on the payments on the Notes, the Issuer may
redeem all but not some of the Notes at a redemption price
of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but
excluding) the date of redemption. See “Description of the
_Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . .** All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under or with respect to the Notes or its
Guarantee, as applicable, will be made without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future
taxes in any taxing jurisdiction unless required by applicable
law. If withholding or deduction for such taxes is required to
be made in a relevant taxing jurisdiction with respect to a
payment on the Notes or the Guarantees, subject to certain
exceptions, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case
may be, will pay the additional amounts necessary so that
the net amount received after the withholding or deduction
is not less than the amount that would have been received in
the absence of the withholding or deduction. See
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture will contain covenants that, among other
things, will limit the ability of the Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries to:

                  - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain
preferred stock;

                  - make restricted payments, including dividends or other
distributions;

                   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                    - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                    - sell certain assets;

                  - guarantee additional debt without also guaranteeing the
Notes;

                    - create restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries
to pay dividends or make other payments to the Issuer;

                   - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

                   - merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or
substantially all of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s assets; and

                   - impair the Security Interests for the benefit of the holders
of the Notes.

These covenants are subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions as described under “Description
_of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

**Certain U.S. Federal Income**
**Tax Considerations . . . . . . . . . . .** For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations of an investment in the Notes, see “Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax_
_Considerations.” You should consult your own tax advisor to_
determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax
consequences of an investment in the Notes.

**Original Issue Discount . . . . .** If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds the issue
price by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily
defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will be
considered to be issued with original issue discount (“OID”)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued
with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest on a Note,
a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) will generally be_
required to include the OID on such Note in gross income (as
ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity
basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in advance of the
receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is
attributable and regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
See “Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal
_Income Tax Considerations.”_

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not
be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities
laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or
sold, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act. We have not agreed to, or otherwise
undertaken to, register the Notes (including by way of an
exchange offer). See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The gross proceeds of the Offering will be used, together
with the proceeds of the Senior Term Loan and the Equity
Contribution, to fund the consideration payable for the
Acquisition, repay certain existing indebtedness of the Group
and pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Transactions, including estimated fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Offering. See “—The
_Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”_

**No Established Market . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently
no established trading market. Although the Initial
Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a
market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and
they may discontinue market-making at any time without
notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid
market for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

# Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information

The following tables set forth summary consolidated financial information and other data of Cerba
HealthCare for the years ended and as of the dates indicated below. The historical summary
consolidated financial information of Cerba HealthCare set forth below as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements of Cerba HealthCare as of and for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016,
which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. Some of the performance indicators and ratios shown below were taken from
Cerba HealthCare’s accounting records and are not included in Cerba HealthCare’s audited financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

The entire share capital of the Target will be sold directly or indirectly to BidCo on the
Acquisition Completion Date in connection with the Transactions and, as part of the PostCompletion Mergers, Cerba HealthCare will be merged into BidCo, the direct subsidiary of the
Issuer. BidCo and the Issuer were formed for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions. None
of them have any business operations or material assets or liabilities other than those incurred in
connection with their incorporation and the Transactions. We do not present in this Offering
Memorandum any financial information or financial statements of BidCo or the Issuer for the
periods presented, other than certain limited financial data presented on a consolidated basis “as
adjusted” to reflect the Transactions and the offering of the Notes.

We have also presented summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial and other data
prepared to give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016, in the case
of summary unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement information, and December 31,
2016, in the case of summary unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet information. The
_pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we_
believe are reasonable. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial and other data
are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our pro forma interest
expense actually would have been if the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2016, or what
our actual net financial debt would have been had the Transactions occurred on December 31,
2016, or on any other date and such data do not purport to project our financial results for any
future period.

The summary consolidated financial information below includes certain non-IFRS measures that
we use to evaluate our economic and financial performance. These measures are not identified as
accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered a substitute for, or
superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those
calculated using financial measures that are prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation
_of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”_

You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the sections “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information,” “Use of Proceeds,”_
“Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information” and “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated_
financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our
historical results do not necessarily indicate results that may be expected for any future period.

(a) Represents provisions for doubtful accounts, which are considered recurring items but were not excluded from the
calculation of EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

(b) Represents the movement in provision related to our liability for future payments under the pension and retirement plans
applicable to our employees. Actual payments under applicable pension and retirement plans are charged against the
provision. This movement in provision is an IFRS requirement and is calculated on the basis of actuarial estimates of future
liabilities. As this provision is a non-cash charge in our income statement, we adjust EBITDA for that charge. Actual payments
under applicable pension and retirement plans related to the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 are included in
EBITDA for these periods.

(c) Represents the costs incurred in connection with incurrence of new debt and issuance of share capital, which management
considers non-recurring finance costs.

(d) Represents net gains from disposal of assets such as obsolete medical equipment, which management considers to be nonrecurring with respect to certain assets.

(e) Represents the transactional costs associated with certain acquisitions, such as advisory fees. In 2014, M&A costs included
an earnout charge related to Medic Lab BVBA that we acquired in 2011. In 2015, M&A costs mostly related to our acquisition
of Novescia.

(f) Represents various litigation costs in connection with disputes that do not relate to our ordinary course business
operations including a dispute with the sale of a subsidiary we acquired in 2011. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.”

(g) Represents costs incurred in connection with implementing restructuring plans (mostly redundancies and severance
payments) following our acquisition of certain companies.

(h) Represents the add-back of negative EBITDA contributions for the year ended December 31, 2016, of (i) our Cerbavet
entity related to our veterinary business (€1.2 million), (ii) our Menalabs management entity in connection with the
establishment of a new laboratory network in the UAE (€0.8 million), (iii) our Central Lab entities in connection with our
innovations for our Central Lab Business (€0.8 million) and (iv) our Cerba Specimen Services S.A.S. entity in connection with
the acquisition of Menalabs (€0.2 million), each of which management considers to be non-recurring expenses, including
ramp-up and relocation expenses, materials expenses, staff expenses and other expenses for the establishment of new
businesses.

(i) Represents a reduction in net sales in the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a temporary reduction of 7.4% imposed
by the French social security in the prices for substantially all of the clinical tests we performed in France between
November 15, 2016, and December 31, 2016. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The prices we may charge in
_our markets are dependent on tariffs set by governments. Efforts to reduce government spending on healthcare and_
_diagnostic testing may adversely affect our business.”_

(j) Adjusted EBITDA (before temporary price cut) amounted to €140.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

(k) Represents the EBITDA of nine companies that we acquired between January 1, 2016 and February 10, 2017 and one
company that we have agreed to acquire (pursuant to a letter of intent signed in 2016), as if they had been acquired on


30


-----

January 1, 2016, and estimated cost savings and synergies realized for such period as a result of these and prior-year
acquisitions on an annual run rate basis. These adjustments include €6.1 million of EBITDA contribution of companies acquired
between January 1, 2016 and February 10, 2017 (and one acquisition that we agreed pursuant to a letter of intent signed in
2016 (the “2016 Acquisitions”)), €4.5 million of anticipated cost savings and synergies in connection with the acquisitions
completed in 2015, €2.0 million of anticipated cost savings and synergies in connection with the 2016 Acquisitions and
€3.0 million of anticipated cost savings and synergies to be achieved in 2017 in connection with acquisitions completed
between January 1, 2016 and February 10, 2017.

The presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the
results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully
integrated on January 1, 2016. The calculations for Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions and
management estimates. The EBITDA of each of the relevant acquired companies for the year ended December 31, 2016 may
not be representative of what the EBITDA of such entities would have been for the years ended December 31, 2016. These
numbers have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information
is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or
results of operations of the relevant acquired companies for periods prior to their acquisition, may not be comparable to our
consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not
be relied upon when making an investment decision. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is included in this Offering Memorandum
because we believe that it provides a useful measure of our results of operations; however, this information does not
constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS, and you should not consider Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as an
alternative to operating income/(loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of
our results of operations or liquidity. Other companies, including those in our industry, may calculate a similarly titled
financial measure differently from us, and so the presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies. Funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for
management’s discretionary use due to covenant restrictions, debt service payments or other commitments.

(7) As adjusted interest expense represents our estimated interest expense on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31,
2016, after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016. This reflects the interest expense in
connection with debt incurred under our existing financial leases and other financial debt that is expected to remain outstanding
on the Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes offered hereby and debt under the Senior Term Loan that will be outstanding pro
_forma for the Transactions assuming an imputed interest rate for the Senior Term Loan and Notes offered hereby. Each variation_
of 0.25% compared to these assumptions in the actual interest rate for (i) the Notes would cause a variation in as adjusted
interest expense of €0.45 million and (ii) the debt under the Senior Term Loan would cause a variation in as adjusted interest
expense of €1.99 million. Our new Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not be drawn on the Acquisition Completion Date and
we have assumed for purposes of this calculation that the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement was undrawn through 2016. See
“Use of Proceeds.” As adjusted interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to
represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2016, nor does it
purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our financial position at any future date.

(8) As adjusted net financial debt (excluding the Notes) represents the principal amount of our loans and borrowings other than
the Notes and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Guarantees, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and the application
of the proceeds therefrom as if the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2016.

(9) As adjusted net financial debt (including the Notes) represents the principal amount of our loans and borrowings including the
principal amount of the Notes offered hereby after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and the application of the
proceeds therefrom as if the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2016.

(10) Our Central Lab backlog is based on anticipated net sales from uncompleted projects that our customers have awarded.
Backlog is the amount of net sales that remains to be earned and recognized on written awards, signed contracts and letters of
intent. While the amount of net sales included in the backlog is reviewed on an annual basis by our auditors by inquiries with
management, as part of the annual audit of our financial statements, to reflect signed contracts and letters of intent, there can
be no assurance that the net sales included in the backlog are a fair and accurate indicator of future net sales. Our backlog may
not be indicative of our future results and we cannot assure you that we will realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected
in our backlog. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our Central Lab backlog may not be indicative of future
_results.”_

#### Risks Related to Our Business

**_The prices we may charge in our markets are dependent on tariffs set by governments._**
**_Efforts to reduce government spending on healthcare and diagnostic testing may_**
**_adversely affect our business._**
In the countries where we operate, most of our activities are highly regulated. In particular, there
are mandatory prices or pricing methodologies for all or substantially all of the clinical tests we
perform as part of our Routine Lab business and the large majority of clinical tests performed as
part of our Specialized Testing business. Tariffs are established by governments and we have
limited, or no, influence over the levels at which they are set. Revisions of tariffs may occur on a
regular basis. Overall tariff decreases, or tariff setting that fails to keep pace with testing costs,
reduce our margins and may affect our net sales from testing services, our operating results or
the economic feasibility of providing certain testing services by some or all of our laboratories.

We are particularly sensitive to prices in France, as our French Routine Lab business represented
60.8% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, and France accounted for 91.9% of
our Specialized Testing net sales over the same period. Prices for substantially all of the
laboratory tests in France are regulated and set by the Ministry of Health (Ministère des Affaires
_sociales et de la Santé) and the National Health Insurance Fund (Caisse Nationale d’Assurance_
_Maladie, or “CNAM”). According to “Les dépenses de santé en 2015—Résultats des comptes de la_
_santé,” approximately 70% of the spending in the French private clinical pathology testing_
market was financed by the French social security system in 2015. While the percentage of
spending financed by the social security system has remained relatively constant over time, the
regulatory tariffs in the French lab market have declined between 0.8% and 4.1% per year
during the period from 2006 to 2015, according to the CNAM “Rapport Charges et produits pour
_l’année 2017.” Based on this report, the French government targets annual savings in French_
healthcare expenditures of approximately €1.4 billion in 2017. Clinical pathology testing
expenditures represented approximately 2.0% of overall French healthcare expenditures in 2015.
The CNAM revises the price catalog for laboratory tests on a quarterly basis which, combined
with a three-year agreement capping the growth of overall testing spending at 0.25% per year
from 2017 to 2019 (See “Industry—Clinical Pathology Testing—Market Overview—France”) will
create further downward pressure on tariffs in France going forward as the government
endeavors to further reduce the rate of growth of national healthcare expenditures, although
we are unable to be certain of the extent of any future reductions. In the fourth quarter of 2016,
CNAM reduced the prices of all tests across the board as a temporary cost-cutting measure, which
was revised in January 2017. Additionally, while the reduction in tariffs has in the past been
offset by growth resulting from a combined volume and mix impact, we cannot guarantee that
this trend will continue, and a decline in volume growth coupled with further tariff decreases
would have a material impact on our net sales. Furthermore, because of the importance of the

32


-----

French market to our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses, further tariff reductions in
France could significantly adversely affect our overall performance. Finally, France currently
benefits from higher tariffs compared to most other European countries due to its fragmented
market, and therefore has increased down side risk for prices. For more detail on French tariffs
for laboratory tests, see “Industry—Clinical Pathology Testing—Market Overview—France.”

In the Belgian and Luxembourg Routine Lab market (which represented 11.2% of our net sales
for the year ended December 31, 2016), laboratory tests are state regulated and prices are set by
the national healthcare regulatory body INAMI on an annual basis. According to the INAMI, the
Belgian social security system reimburses approximately 75% of regulated clinical pathology test
expenditures. Belgium has also experienced budgetary pressures, setting annual caps for
healthcare expenses. Currently, the Belgian pricing system includes a “claw back” mechanism
that allows the Belgian government to recover budgetary overspend. On November 1, 2013, the
Belgian government also reduced fixed fee for ambulatory care (clinical biology) by
approximately 9% and a further 4% to 5% in April 2016, including for laboratory tests
performed by non-hospital laboratories, such as ours (see Royal Decree of October 18, 2013
amending the Royal Decree of 24 September 1992 laying down the procedures for fixed fee for
certain clinical laboratory services provided to ambulatory patients, as well as the outsourcing of
these services and Royal Decree of November, 9 2016 amending the Royal Decree of
24 September 1992 laying down the procedures for fixed fee for certain clinical laboratory
services provided to ambulatory patients, as well as the outsourcing of these services).
Additionally, according to the specialized press, the number of accredited laboratories has
decreased by 12.5% between March 2010 and February 2014 (Le Medecin Spécialiste, n° spécial/
April 2014, ISSN 0770 8181). See “Industry—Clinical Pathology Testing—Market Overview—
_Belgium.”_

In Luxembourg, the Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé) and the national insurance scheme
(Caisse Nationale de Santé) sets the prices for all laboratory tests. The state reimburses 100% of
test expenses at the fee levels set in the annual catalog released by government health
authorities. The Luxembourg government has also undertaken measures to control increases in
healthcare expenditure through limiting the tariffs for laboratory tests. See “Industry—Clinical
_Pathology Testing—Market Overview—Luxembourg.”_

We expect increased constraints on government regulated tariffs to continue in each of the
markets in which we conduct our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses. The recent
financial and monetary crisis in Europe has brought concerns over European countries’ sovereign
debt and government spending. As a result, many European countries, including France and
Belgium, have announced or undertaken expenditure control measures aimed at curbing
spending, including healthcare expenditures. In particular, governments tend to reduce in
greater proportion tariff levels on tests that are administered in high volumes, which has a
multiplying effect on our results as the tests we perform in high volumes tend to be impacted by
larger tariff cuts. In addition, any changes in government or in the political environment in the
countries in which we operate may cause future regulatory changes in the healthcare industry,
which could have a negative impact on our business. For example, policies that constrain
consolidation in markets in which we operate, limit or decrease the amounts we may charge for
our services or exclude coverage of certain of our services from public health programs may have
a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating results.

**_Continued weakness in economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our_**
**_businesses._**
The economic downturn and the financial and monetary crisis that Europe has been facing since
2008 have increased the risk associated with conducting our business. Economic difficulties have
resulted in reduced levels of activity and have led governments, private insurers and patients to
reduce their expenditures on healthcare, which has affected our net sales and margins.

33


-----

Where patients, directly or indirectly (such as through private health insurance premiums), are
responsible for all or part of the cost of laboratory tests, individual decisions to reduce healthcare
expenditures may result in a reduction of demand for our services. In France, for example,
approximately 70% of spending in the French private clinical pathology testing market was
financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private insurance
companies (approximately 25%) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately 3%) in
2015, according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2015—Résultats des comptes de la santé.” A
decrease in household disposable income, or the perception thereof, in times of economic
downturn can lead to a reduction in individuals’ healthcare expenditure. This may result in
patients postponing certain types of medical treatment and could result in a significant drop in
the volume of business we are able to conduct through our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing
businesses.

Governments, as direct payers of a test’s price, whether in part or in whole, have also instituted
policies designed to reduce their expenditures on healthcare as a means of reducing overall
budget deficits. As a result of such policies, changes in medical guidelines could occur, leading to
lower volumes of recurring tests. Such changes could have a negative impact on our business.

Further, the economic downturn could also have a negative effect on the research and
development budgets of pharmaceutical companies with which we have contracts to perform
testing work as part of our Central Lab business and reduce demand for our services. For
example, the availability of financing from banks or the capital markets to the biotechnology or
pharmaceutical industry can have a material impact on their ability to fund development of their
products. Generally, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies tend to streamline the
development and testing of new products at times when the economy is depressed and when, as
a consequence, their own profitability and investment capabilities are limited. As a result, they
tend to limit the number of, and be more selective regarding, new trials and may also postpone
or cancel existing trials when proof of efficacy is not quickly evidenced. Reduced demand from
our Central Lab clients could have a negative effect on our results of operations.

**_We may not exercise full control over the operations of certain of our French_**
**_subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest and are dependent on the_**
**_clinical pathologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the_**
**_operations of such subsidiaries._**
French law sets regulatory constraints on the corporate structure and nature of ownership of the
share capital of clinical laboratories. In particular, French law requires that a majority of the
shares and voting rights of a laboratory company be held by clinical pathologists working in the
relevant laboratory company. In addition, this regulation requires that persons that are not
clinical pathologists and entities that are not laboratory companies cannot hold more than 25%
of the share capital of a laboratory. See “Regulation—Regulations Affecting Our Routine Lab and
_Specialized Testing Businesses—France.”_

As a result, our corporate structure in France is such that our non-laboratory company subsidiary,
Cefid, holds 25% of the voting rights and share capital in certain of our French laboratory
subsidiaries (currently Cerba Selafa), with clinical pathologists operating such French laboratory
subsidiaries holding the balance, i.e., a majority of the voting rights. The bylaws of such French
laboratory subsidiaries allow Cefid to hold approximately 99% of the financial rights (rights to
receive dividend payments) in Cerba Selafa. In addition, Cerba Selafa holds up to 49.9% of the
voting rights in our other French laboratory company subsidiaries, with clinical pathologists
operating each such other French laboratory subsidiary holding a majority of the voting rights.
Cerba Selafa also holds between approximately 70% and 99.99% of these subsidiaries’ financial
rights. We are currently implementing our corporate structure for Novescia, which we acquired in
March 2015. We believe the implementation would largely be complete by the end of the first
quarter of 2017.

34


-----

The subsidiary shareholders of our French laboratory subsidiaries have entered into shareholders’
agreements with the clinical pathologists working in the relevant French laboratory subsidiary.
Although these shareholders’ agreements provide such subsidiary shareholders with de facto
control on major decisions relating to the operations of the laboratory subsidiaries through veto
rights within controlling bodies (board of directors or strategic committees), we do not exercise
control over the appointment by the subsidiary shareholders of our representatives in the
controlling bodies of the French laboratory subsidiaries, as these decisions can be taken by the
clinical pathologists owning a majority of the voting rights in the subsidiary shareholders. In
addition, the obligations and constraints resulting from these shareholders’ agreements are
limited by French regulatory constraints regarding the independence of clinical pathologists. See
“Business—Our Specific Corporate Structure.” This legal structure does not confer on us the same
powers we would have if we were holding all or a majority of the voting rights of our French
subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent on the clinical pathologists who hold the majority of
the voting rights in our French subsidiaries for decisions affecting these subsidiaries’ day to day
routine operations. Although, with respect to other actions at Cerba Selafa, we exercise de facto
control, the clinical pathologists who hold the majority of the voting rights in our French
laboratory subsidiaries may not necessarily share our views on the manner in which the
subsidiaries should be managed and may exercise their voting rights in a manner adverse to us.
This could disrupt the operations of our French laboratories and divert our management’s time
and attention from the day to day operation of our business. If our business activities were
disrupted due to a conflict with our clinical pathologists, our operating results could be
negatively affected.

In addition, under the terms of the bylaws and shareholders’ agreements of certain of our French
laboratory subsidiaries, we may be required to purchase shares held by the clinical pathologist
shareholders, upon their retirement or for other reasons. This could result in our holding a
greater percentage of the share capital and voting rights in such French laboratory subsidiaries
than is permitted by French law. Although there is a one year grace period in the law to reduce
the holdings back down to the maximum permitted level, if we fail to reduce our holdings within
such period, we may be required to dissolve or wind up such subsidiary. Furthermore, as the
grace period does not technically apply to the validity of the licenses of such subsidiaries and as
such if we surpass the maximum ownership threshold for share capital and voting rights, even
during the one year grace period, the licenses of such subsidiaries could be subject to revocation.

Although we typically seek to align the shareholders’ agreements of our newly acquired French
laboratory subsidiaries with those of our existing subsidiaries, as the consent of the clinical
pathologists is required for such alignment, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do
so in the future, including in connection with the Acquisition.

**_We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our_**
**_activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities_**
**_may be negatively impacted if we fail to comply._**
Our business is subject to, and impacted by, extensive, stringent and frequently changing laws
and regulations in each of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations
relating to:

- billing and reimbursement of clinical tests;

- certification or licensure of clinical laboratories;

- operational, personnel and quality requirements relating to clinical laboratory testing,
including quality control audits by regulatory authorities to which we are periodically subject;

- safety and health of clinical laboratory employees;

35


-----

- handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and infectious and hazardous waste;

- direct and indirect ownership of clinical laboratories in France (including the ownership, by the
shareholders of laboratory companies, of other businesses in certain sectors);

- outsourcing of clinical laboratory services in France;

- limitations of market share for clinical laboratory testing within a given geographic area and
between adjacent regions in France;

- personnel redeployment or personnel reduction plans;

- relationships with doctors and hospitals (including laws and regulations prohibiting kickbacks
and regulating gifts or fringe benefits); and

- privacy of patient data.

These laws and regulations, some of which have not been fully interpreted by courts as to their
extent, may require us to modify our operations or impose additional compliance expenses or
burdens or give rise to administrative fines and penalties. For example, recent French regulatory
reforms have imposed stricter International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) operating
standards (namely ISO 15189), and introduced minimum accreditation standards for laboratories
to be complied with by 2020 (with two intermediary steps in 2016 and 2018), the implementation
of which is costly and time consuming. The laboratory accreditation process involves the
preparation of written applications, site studies and assessment of the scope of changes required
to comply with new standards, the appointment of external qualified experts, the training of our
staff, the participation of our staff in the process in addition to their usual workload, the
payment of certain administrative fees and the implementation of new quality software.
Accreditation may be delayed based on many factors, including the number of sites operated by
a clinical laboratory and the responsiveness of the accreditation body, the COFRAC (Comité
_français d’accréditation). Although we have already undertaken to conduct our business in_
compliance with these heightened standards, any further changes in laws and regulations may
require us to further modify our operations. In Belgium, accreditation under ISO 15189 has
become a condition for the reimbursement of laboratory tests performed on the DNA of a
microorganism (virus) (see Royal Decree of March 19, 2008, modifying the annex of the Royal
Decree of September 14, 1984, establishing the nomenclature of healthcare services relative to
the public health insurance). According to a Royal Degree of January 31, 2006, BELAC (Organisme
_belge d’Accréditation) is the only public body authorized to give such an accreditation. Also, as_
far as Luxembourg is concerned, and pursuant to a recent agreement entered into on June 10,
2015 with effect as from January 1, 2016 between the National Health Insurance and the
Luxembourg federation of medical analysis laboratories, at least 90% of the laboratories’
activities that are subject to a reimbursement from the National Health Insurance must be
accredited under ISO 15189 standard by 2023. The agreement sets out two intermediary phases
for such accreditation (with 50% of the laboratories’ activities to be accredited on January 1,
2019, at the latest and 80% of these activities to be accredited in 2021) as well as specific
different timeframes for laboratories having started their activities after January 1, 2016.

As discussed above, French law imposes stringent restrictions on the legal structure and
ownership of clinical laboratories. Recently, the Syndicat des Jeunes Biologistes Me´dicaux (SJBM),
a trade union representing certain young biologists in France, announced that it may initiate
legal proceedings against us, alleging that the competent French regulators should not approve
two upcoming mergers within our network because those would, in SJBM’s view, not be
permitted by the French law dated May 30, 2013. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” and
_“Regulation—Regulations Affecting Our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing Businesses—_
_France” and “—We may not exercise full control over the operations of certain of our French_
_subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest and are dependent on the clinical_
_pathologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such_
_subsidiaries.”_

36


-----

In addition, we are subject to specific Belgian regulations relating to the operation of the clinical
laboratory business. See “Regulation—Regulations Affecting Our Routine Lab and Specialized
_Testing Businesses—Belgium.” In particular, the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 (implementing_
Article 3 §1(2) of the Royal Decree n° 143 of 30 December 1982) lists the four legal forms that
clinical laboratory companies should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the
Belgian public health insurance system. These four corporate forms are: société privée à
_responsabilité limitée / besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid (SPRL/BVBA),_
_société en nom collectif/vennootschap onder firma (SNC/VOF), société coopérative/cooperative_
_vennootschap (SC/CV) and association sans but lucratif / vereniging zonder winstoogmerk (ASBL/_
VZW). This Royal Decree (after having been extended once) expired on December 31, 2012. The
relevant agencies have not shown any indication that reimbursements would cease. The current
legal gap should be filled by a new Decree which, as of March 2017, is still in draft form and
should be submitted to the Belgian government for approval. According to oral sources at the
INAMI, this draft Decree (i) will leave unchanged the four legal forms that clinical laboratories
should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public health insurance
system and (ii) will provide that these rules are no longer subject to expiration. However, this
information has been obtained from unofficial sources at the INAMI. It is currently unclear
whether the draft Decree will be adopted and, if so, what its content will be. The absence of any
form of extension of the duration of the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 could have a significant
impact on all Belgian laboratories run under the same corporate form as ours, including us.

Through our Central Lab business, we are exposed to stringent regulations relating to the
conduct of the pharmaceutical business from regulatory authorities (such as the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, the U.K. Department of Health and the European Medicines Agency) and
from quality control representatives from our clients. We must maintain records and reports for
each study we conduct for specified periods for auditing by the study sponsor and by any
regulatory authorities. At least once during each clinical trial, we undergo an on-site inspection
from our clients to ensure that we are meeting standards laid out in our customer contracts.
Changes to certain regulations or government programs that are not directly connected with the
clinical laboratory testing market, such as regulations relating to doctors, pharmaceutical
companies (particularly in the design and conduct of testing protocols in connection with our
Central Lab business), health insurers and hospitals, could also affect us and impair our results of
operations and our ability to expand our business.

Although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and
regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a
different conclusion. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, if they or their
interpretation by competent authorities change in a manner adverse to us or our integration
business model or if we cannot maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses,
accreditations or other necessary regulatory approvals, we could be unable to operate our
business or commercialize our services in the relevant jurisdictions, be excluded from
participating in governmental healthcare programs, suffer civil and criminal penalties or fines, or
incur additional liabilities from third party claims. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our
reputation could be damaged, important relationships with government regulators or third
parties could be adversely affected and these developments could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations or financial condition and prospects.

For more details on the particular regulations that directly affect our business, see “Regulation.”

**_All the arrangements between shareholders of our laboratory companies that are not_**
**_contained in the bylaws could become unenforceable if they were not communicated_**
**_to the relevant professional association._**
Article L. 6223-8 III of the French Public Health Code provides that, in order to be binding and
enforceable, all arrangements relating to a laboratory company (including shareholder
agreements) must be communicated to the relevant professional association (Ordre national des
_pharmaciens and / or Ordre national des médecins). Failing to do so, the shareholding_
agreements pertaining to our laboratory companies could become unenforceable.

For more details on the particular regulations that directly affect our business, see “Regulation.”

**_Our Central Lab business depends on the pharmaceutical industry and creates a risk of_**
**_liability._**
Our Central Lab business relies on contracts with pharmaceutical companies and contract
research organizations to carry out drug development trials and studies. As a result, our Central
Lab net sales, which accounted for €25.0 million or 3.9% of our net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2016, down from €44.7 million or 11.2% of our net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2014, depend greatly on the expenditures made by pharmaceutical companies in
research and development. In some instances, pharmaceutical companies are reliant on the
strength of their financial performance or their ability to raise capital in order to fund their
research and development projects. Accordingly, economic factors affecting our Central Lab
customers’ financial performance or their access to the capital markets also affect our business.
Further, changes by health insurance companies or government payers in reimbursement
practices or in setting the tariffs for pharmaceutical products or changes in regulatory guidelines
for compound testing could have a negative effect on our customers’ research and development
budgets. If pharmaceutical companies were to reduce the number of research and development
projects they conduct or outsource, our Central Lab business and, as a consequence, our results of
operations as a whole could be materially adversely affected.

Further, our Central Lab business exposes us to a range of potential liabilities related to several
factors, such as:

- risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our customers’ property, such as
samples, trial products, records, work in progress, other archived materials, or goods and
materials in transit, while in our possession;

- risks associated with potential delays and/or cancellations of trials;

- errors or omissions from tests conducted for the pharmaceutical industry;

- errors or omissions during a study that may undermine the usefulness of a study or data from
the study; and

- errors or omissions that result in harm to volunteers during a trial or injury to consumers of a
drug after regulatory approval of such drug.

While we endeavor to maintain appropriate liability insurance coverage and to include in our
contracts provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability, these
provisions do not uniformly protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions,
such as negligence or misconduct. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were
required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a
contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does
not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage
or for which insurance coverage is not available. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to maintain insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us. Any indemnity or damages that we
must pay in excess of our insurance coverage could have a negative impact on our results of
operations.

**_Failure to establish and comply with appropriate quality standards in the provision of_**
**_our testing services could result in litigation and liabilities and adversely impact our_**
**_reputation._**
The tests we perform as part of our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses are intended
to supply healthcare professionals with information to help them establish or support diagnoses
and prescribe medication and treatment for patient care. Our Central Lab operations provide

38


-----

pharmaceutical companies with data on the safety and efficacy of their products. Inaccuracies or
negligence in performing our testing services could lead to inaccurate drug efficacy and safety
studies, incorrect diagnoses by doctors, prescriptions of inappropriate treatment or decisions not
to prescribe treatment when treatment is required, which may lead to illness, harm, death, other
adverse effects or liabilities. Errors such as misidentifying or inaccurately labeling samples,
compromising the integrity of samples and errors caused by testing machines or reagents may
occur. Claims and litigation against us may result in liability for the harm or other adverse effects
caused. Payments related to such liabilities may adversely affect our liquidity and financial
position. The process of defending such cases, even when we are successful in our defense, is
costly, could distract management from executing our strategy and could result in substantial
damage to our reputation in the medical community and with patients. To the extent we are
held liable for misrepresentation or negligence, the damages that we may owe could have a
material negative financial impact on our business.

**_We face risks associated with the acquisition of businesses in connection with our_**
**_strategy._**
In the past we have made strategic acquisitions by acquiring large laboratory testing groups in
France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the UAE, such as Cerballiance Paris, Cerballiance Hauts-deFrance, Cerballiance Provence, Cerballiance Réunion, JS Bio, LLAM, Novescia and Menalabs. Our
growth strategy is to focus on smaller acquisitions of laboratories and integrate them into our
network, particularly in France, and we may consider larger acquisitions in other regions and
segments of the market. For instance, in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, we
have respectively completed three, seven and five acquisitions, out of which two, five and four,
respectively, were bolt-on acquisitions. We plan to pursue our focus on small acquisition targets
going forward and we will also selectively consider larger strategic acquisitions to the extent they
complement our network. Any such acquisition could substantially increase the amount of our
outstanding debt.

The success of our acquisition strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable
acquisition targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms
and ultimately agree and complete such transactions and integrate the acquired business into
our Group. Our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to the availability
of suitable opportunities at an attractive price, particularly in France and planned acquisitions
may not materialize. The continued consolidation of the French clinical laboratory testing
market, as well as the restrictions on both regional market share and outsourcing, may limit the
opportunities for acquisitions. Current laboratory ownership constraints in France have allowed
for the development of regional laboratory hubs that combine several smaller local laboratories
into a larger regional entity. However, French regulation still limits the proportion of tests that
one person or entity may perform in a specified territory, which limits our ability to pursue this
strategy. Further, French tax reforms may limit clinical pathologists’ willingness to sell to a
potential buyer by imposing prohibitive capital gains tax rates. Some of our competitors are
following similar acquisition strategies and they, and certain financial investors interested in
entering our market, may have greater financial resources available for investments or may have
capacity to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, preventing us from acquiring the
businesses that we target and/or reducing the number of potential acquisition targets. In
addition, certain of our competitors already have, or may attain through acquisitions, a greater
geographical footprint within a particular region, country or within Europe, making them a more
attractive acquirer for potential targets seeking to join a network, the size of which they believe
will provide greater business prospects.

We expand into new regions by first acquiring an existing regional cluster together with, or
followed by bolt-on acquisitions of, smaller laboratories that we transform into collection centers
where samples are collected from patients and sent to be tested at the regional technical
platform. Similarly, we entered the UAE market by acquiring a majority stake in Menalabs in
2016. Generally, we acquire businesses based, in part, on anticipated synergies that will
materialize after we are able to combine the acquired business with our own. The success of our

39


-----

acquisition strategy hinges upon the successful realization of such synergies within a reasonable
timeframe. Achieving synergies, particularly from the acquisition of large regional clusters, can
be difficult and uncertain. Achieving synergies in international acquisitions may be more difficult
than in bolt-on transactions in France, or may not be successful at all. We anticipate such
synergies based on our due diligence of the target company (including its existing governance
structure) as well as standalone business models. Changes in either affect the timeframe in which
we are able to realize such synergies or our ability to realize them at all. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain the customer base, suppliers or other contractual
arrangement with third parties of businesses we acquire (in particular where they are subject to
change of control clauses), generate expected margins or cash flows, or realize the anticipated
benefits of such acquisitions, including growth or expected synergies, in the timeframe we
initially anticipate, if at all. Although we analyze acquisition targets, those assessments are
subject to assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates, company valuations and
ability to redeploy the workforce. There can be no assurance that our assessments of and
assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may
significantly differ from our expectations. In most cases, acquisitions involve the integration of a
separate business that was previously operated independently with different systems and
processes.

Even if we are able to acquire new companies, unless we are able to integrate the companies we
acquire in the future into our own operations successfully, our ability to expand our operations
and operate efficiently may weaken. We may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully
into our business or such integration may require more investment or time than we expect, and
we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies with respect to
customers, employees, suppliers, government authorities or public health programs, private
health insurers, or to other parties, which may impact our results of operations. Certain of the
businesses we acquire may not have robust accounting systems and internal controls and
reporting systems, and as such the historical financial results of such businesses may be different
from those reported to us. Additionally, from time to time, disputes may arise with the sellers of
businesses we acquire, some of which continue to hold interests in the company and/or
management positions. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” Such risks can be exacerbated in
executing international acquisitions, as we are less familiar with the competitive, operational and
regulatory environments in these markets and may not be able to identify suitable targets or be
able to integrate them successfully to achieve the desired synergies. The process of integrating
businesses may be disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of
momentum in, such businesses or a decrease in our results of operations as a result of difficulties
or risks, including:

- unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues (in particular where they are subject
to change of control clauses);

- loss of key customers or employees;

- delays in redeploying our workforce;

- difficulty in standardizing information and other systems;

- difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;

- difficulty in realizing operating synergies;

- failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that we have historically provided;

- added costs of dealing with such disruptions;

- regulatory and labor law restrictions on the redeployment or termination of employees;

40


-----

- unforeseen challenges from operating in new geographic areas; and

- diversion of management’s attention from our day to day business as a result of the need to
deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties.

Furthermore, we operate and acquire businesses in different countries, with different regulatory
and operating cultures, which may exacerbate the risks described above. If we are unable to
implement our acquisition strategy or integrate acquired businesses successfully, our business and
our growth could be negatively affected.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full_**
**_value thereof._**
We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. Total goodwill, which represents the excess
of cost over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired, was €982.3 million as of
December 31, 2016, or 70.2% of our total assets. We expect goodwill to increase further as a
result of the purchase accounting for the Acquisition, with exact amounts determined following
the purchase price allocation.

Goodwill is recorded on the date of an acquisition and, in accordance with IFRS, is tested for
impairment annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result
from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected future cash
flows, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations (including
changes that restrict the activities of, or affect the services provided by, our laboratories) and a
variety of other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a
charge to our income statement. Any future impairment of goodwill may result in material
reductions of our income and equity under IFRS.

**_If we lose the services of members of our senior management team, our business and_**
**_operating results may be harmed._**
The execution of our strategy and our continued success depend in part on the skills, continued
efforts and motivation of our senior management team and other key personnel. Our strategy
for organic growth and improved operating efficiency depends on our senior management
having deep knowledge of our business operations. Our external growth strategy requires
knowledge of the dynamics and relevant players in the various markets in which we operate. Loss
of the services of key members of our senior management or experienced personnel could
disrupt the pursuit of our strategy. If one or more members of our senior management team or
key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, including for health,
family or other personal reasons, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all. An inability
to attract and retain qualified members or key personnel in a timely manner could have a
material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_If we fail to recruit specialized clinical pathologists, our businesses, particularly our_**
**_Specialized Testing business, could be adversely affected._**
The success of our business depends on employing and retaining qualified, highly skilled and
experienced clinical pathologists who can maintain and enhance our reputation by providing
testing services in accordance with our standards. As of December 31, 2016, we employed
approximately 415 clinical pathologists. Our Specialized Testing business in particular is reliant on
skilled clinical pathologists who have the scientific and technical expertise required to interpret
the highly sophisticated tests we perform. Although the labor market for clinical pathologists in
general is favorable to employers, it may be difficult to recruit and maintain the employment of
the specialized clinical pathologists we need for our Specialized Testing business. Failing to do so
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

41


-----

**_Increased competition could have a material adverse impact on our results of_**
**_operations._**
We are subject to competition from other market participants, particularly with respect to our
Specialized Testing and Central Lab businesses.

We face competition from other specialized laboratories based on the types of services we are
able to offer, from the range of tests that we provide to the other non-testing services we
provide to local laboratories, such as the pickup and delivery of sample containers. Although our
Specialized Testing business is subject to regulatory pricing constraints in France (which
accounted for 91.9% of our Specialized Testing net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016),
we are not technically subject to regulated prices in other jurisdictions. Price based competition
in countries where prices are not regulated is, however, a commercial constraint for us as we
have to propose to our clients competitive conditions compared to competitors who provide
services locally. In France regional laboratory hubs have recently begun forming due to the
easing of regulatory restrictions on ownership and are a new source of competition for our
Specialized Testing business. These hubs are increasingly able to justify the costs of performing
certain specialized tests due to the combined laboratories’ volume of demand. To a more limited
degree, our Specialized Testing business also faces competition from hospitals that are able to
provide testing themselves.

Our Central Lab business is less regulated than our other lines of business and subjects us to
stronger competition. We face competition from other companies based on their pricing, the
scope of their testing offerings, their scientific and medical expertise, their ability to process
samples and report data accurately and in a timely manner, their historical experience and
customer relationships and the quality of their facilities. We face competition from large
international companies. In addition, we believe that regulatory developments and price based
competition in particular will lead to further consolidation of the central laboratory testing
market, which may further increase price pressure in our Central Lab business. Certain of our
competitors with greater financial resources and stronger market positions than ours could
reduce their prices further than we might be able to in order to increase their market share, offer
larger operational resources and broader geographical reach, or conduct more effective
marketing programs. If we are unable to compete effectively with other companies, our results
of operations may be materially adversely affected.

**_The internalization of testing by hospitals and regional laboratory hubs, as well as the_**
**_development of new, more cost effective tests that can be directly performed by the_**
**_customers of our Specialized Testing business could negatively impact our testing_**
**_volume and net sales._**
Our Specialized Testing customers include public and private hospitals and clinical laboratories
that choose to outsource their specialized testing. Our customers choose to outsource their
specialized testing because they lack the expertise or the resources to cost effectively conduct the
testing themselves. However, as technology progresses, customers may find it more cost efficient
to perform certain specialized tests themselves. For example, until recently, blood testing for the
presence of vitamin D was a fairly complex procedure offered only by sophisticated clinical
laboratories. However, a new routine testing technology was recently developed that allowed
smaller laboratories with less sophisticated equipment to perform the test themselves. This led to
a significant decrease in the demand for our specialized vitamin D blood test. Today, we no
longer derive net sales from vitamin D testing in our Specialized Testing business unit.
Additionally, as smaller clinical laboratories consolidate, they may have the requisite financial
resources and demand to begin performing certain specialized tests for themselves and offering
to do so for others. Manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase
their sales by marketing point of care test equipment to doctors. Finally, over time, if technology
improvements or patient awareness lead to increased demand, tests that we consider part of our
Specialized Testing business may become more routine, tending to be performed by routine
laboratories instead of specialized laboratories, and thus subject our business to downward

42


-----

pricing pressure. If our customers become able to perform specialized tests themselves, and if we
do not offer new or alternative tests attractive to our customers, the demand for our Specialized
Testing business would be reduced and our net sales would be materially adversely impacted.

**_Failures of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause_**
**_the loss of customers or business opportunities._**
Information technology (or “IT”) systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our
business and across each of our lines of business, including for test reporting, billing, customer
service, logistics and management of medical data. Our operations depend on the continued and
uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety
of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters.
Moreover, despite the security measures we have implemented, our IT systems may be subject to
physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems.

IT problems may impact our ability to process test orders, deliver test results, perform or bill for
tests in a timely manner or maintain the privacy of the medical data we collect. If we experience
significant or recurring IT systems problems, including with our implementation of standard
laboratory or billing systems, our operations would be disrupted. If our operations were so
disrupted, it could adversely affect our reputation, expose us to litigation or regulatory sanction
and result in a loss of other customers and negatively affect our net sales.

Additionally, as a consequence of having grown mostly through acquisitions, we do not employ a
uniform software platform among our laboratories. Newly acquired laboratories may continue to
use their existing IT systems for an indefinite amount of time after their acquisition, although we
encourage them to adopt one of two pre-approved IT platforms when they consider changing
their systems. Because most of our operations involve using a single laboratory for a particular
sample and/or patient file, we do not believe it is necessary to implement a uniform information
technology system across our Group. However, there is a risk that our operations could be
disrupted due to any incompatibility among the information technology systems we use, which
could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_Failure to bill timely or accurately for our services could have a material adverse effect_**
**_on our business._**
Billing for our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses is a complex process involving
several payers. Depending on the billing arrangement and the applicable law of the country in
which we operate, the payer may be a third party responsible for providing health insurance
coverage to patients (such as national public health insurance or a private medical insurance
plan), a patient or other party (such as a hospital, another laboratory or an employer) who
outsourced testing to us, or a combination of these parties. Changes in laws and regulations and
the payment policies of third party payers could increase the complexity and cost of our billing
process. In addition, we must maintain procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations in order to ensure that we bill properly for our testing, adding to the cost of the
billing process and our ability to collect payment. For example, new regulation in France in 2012
required that we invoice a routine laboratory that outsources a test to our Specialized Testing
business instead of invoicing patients directly. Certain routine laboratories refused to comply
with these arrangements, which delayed our collection of payments and adversely affected our
cash flows. In connection with our Central Lab business, we bill our clients directly through a
contractually arranged billing framework. Changes in the terms of contractual arrangements
with clients could result in further expense associated with collecting amounts due to us for our
testing. In general, failure to bill timely or accurately for our services or increased complexity in
billing arrangements and procedures may result in delayed payment, increase our working
capital requirements and adversely affect our results of operations.

43


-----

**_Financial difficulties of certain of our clients or third party payers may require us to_**
**_write off debts._**
We encounter third party credit risk where we are reliant on the ability of a third party to be
able to pay for services we provide. We are exposed to varying levels of third party credit risk
across our lines of business. Generally, we bill patients directly for tests rendered as part of our
Routine Lab business. In France and Belgium, although the government sets tariffs for laboratory
testing, only a portion of the cost is paid by social security systems. For example, the social
security system in France financed approximately 70% of the spending in the French medical
laboratory testing market in 2015. In order to make up the difference, patients must either pay
out-of-pocket or file a claim with a private insurance company. As a result, we are exposed to the
risk of not being able to collect amounts due from patients who are unwilling or unable to pay
the portion of the cost for which they are responsible. Our Specialized Testing business relies on
payment from patients or insurance companies to cover all or a portion of a test’s cost, although
in France, new regulations require that we directly invoice routine labs outsourcing specialized
testing. Collection efforts for amounts due from our Specialized Testing business can be difficult,
especially from patients in countries where there is no primary government payer of healthcare
expenses. In addition, our Central Lab business bills pharmaceutical companies and contract
research organizations directly for tests we perform. If a third party payer or a company with
which we have a contractual relationship undergoes financial difficulties, we may not be able to
collect amounts payable to us, resulting in write offs of such debt. We maintain reserves for
doubtful accounts and amounts past due. However, there can be no assurance that such reserves
are sufficiently large for the third party credit risks we face. Significant or recurring incidents of
bad debts would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our Central Lab backlog may not be indicative of future results._**
Our Central Lab backlog of approximately €100 million as of December 31, 2016, is based on
anticipated net sales from uncompleted projects that our customers have awarded. Once work
begins on a project, net sales are recognized over the duration of the project. Backlog is the
amount of net sales that remains to be earned and recognized on written awards, signed
contracts and letters of intent. There can be no assurance that the net sales included in the
backlog are a fair and accurate indicator of future net sales. In addition, contracts included in our
backlog are generally subject to termination by our customers at any time. In the event that a
customer cancels a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services
performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent customer authorized services related to
terminating the cancelled project.

Our backlog may not be indicative of our future results and we cannot assure you that we will
realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog. A number of factors may
affect backlog, including:

- the variable size and duration of a project;

- the loss or delay of a project;

- currency fluctuations of projects billed in currencies other than euro;

- the change in the scope of work during the course of a project; and

- the cancellation of such contracts by our customers.

Also, if projects are delayed, the projects will remain in backlog but will not generate net sales at
the rate originally expected. Cancellation or delay of a large contract or multiple smaller
contracts could result in underutilized resources and require an adjustment to our backlog,
negatively affecting our net sales and results of operations. The historical relationship of backlog
to net sales actually realized by us should not be considered indicative of future results.

**_Failure to comply with and liabilities arising under environmental, health and safety_**
**_laws and regulations could result in the imposition on us of fines, penalties and other_**
**_costs and the loss of our licensing, which could have a material adverse effect upon our_**
**_business._**
Our operations are subject to licensing and other requirements under EU, national and local laws
and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human and occupational
health and safety, including those requirements governing the handling, transportation and
disposal of medical samples and biological, infectious and hazardous waste, as well as those
relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. For example, we must meet strict
requirements in all jurisdictions in which we operate for the disposal of laboratory samples at
authorized facilities and undergo regular audits from national regulators in order to ensure
compliance with mandated quality control standards. In addition, we must meet extensive
requirements relating to workplace safety for employees in clinical laboratories who could be
exposed to various biological risks such as blood-borne pathogens (including HIV and the viruses
that cause hepatitis). These requirements include work practice controls, protective clothing and
equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize
exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.

The environmental, health and safety regulations to which we are subject, including those
governing the disposal of medical waste, are likely to become more stringent over time, and our
costs to comply with these requirements are likely to increase. Moreover, we could incur
substantial costs and sanctions, including civil and criminal fines and penalties, enforcement
actions, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to operate as a result of violations of our
responsibilities under these laws and regulations, any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business. We also may become subject to claims from employees or other persons,
such as those alleging injury or illness resulting from exposure to the samples or waste they
handle.

**_Disruption, failure or unsuitable delivery of sample transportation services could_**
**_adversely affect our business and financial results._**
The proper handling of samples during collection and transportation is essential for maintaining
their integrity and ensuring safety from accidental exposure to potentially infectious
microorganisms. The vehicles used to transport samples must satisfy relevant legal, practical and
technical requirements, which vary depending on the type of samples transported. These
requirements include, for example, the use of appropriate transport containers and packaging,
the labeling of containers, the manner in which samples and containers are stored in the vehicle,
the temperature at which samples must be transported and the duration of the journey. Drivers
employed to transport samples must be trained to handle biological samples in accordance with
best practices and applicable laws and regulations. Mishandling the sample in the collection and
transportation process can increase the likelihood of errors in laboratory testing.

Efficient transportation of samples is key to both our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing
businesses. Our Routine Lab business operates on a model of several collection centers where
samples are collected and then delivered to technical platforms where testing takes place. We
handle the transport of Routine Lab samples from collection centers to technical platforms
ourselves.

Our Specialized Testing business collects samples for testing from over 50 countries in Europe,
North Africa and the Middle East to be delivered to our laboratory in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône,
France. In order to ensure the smooth transportation of samples over such long distances, we
outsource our Specialized Testing transportation logistics. We do not control the facilities or
operations of our outsourced logistics provider and depend on it for its sample transportation
services and conducting its operations in a manner sufficient to maintain the integrity of samples.
In the event of a fault on the part of our outsourced logistics provider, we have the contractual
right to take control of the provider’s vehicles and personnel to assure continuation of service.

45


-----

However, any interruption of our outsourced logistics provider’s operations or any failure by it to
fulfill its contractual commitments could result in damage to our reputation, claims against us
and the loss of customers, which would adversely affect results of operations, financial condition
and prospects.

**_A significant portion of our net sales is derived from operations we conduct at our_**
**_facility in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France. A disruption in the operations of that facility_**
**_could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations._**
All of the tests we perform as part of our Specialized Testing business and a portion of the tests
we carry out for our Central Lab business are conducted at our facility in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône,
France. Our administrative headquarters are also located there. As a result, its uninterrupted
functioning is important to our business. If our operations at that facility were to be disrupted or
compromised for an extended period of time, it could have a material adverse effect upon our
Specialized Testing and Central Lab businesses and, as a consequence, our results of operations as
a whole.

**_We are subject to stringent privacy laws and information security policies._**
We receive, generate and store significant volumes of personal and sensitive information, such as
patient medical information, and are therefore subject to privacy and security regulations with
respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information intended to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. Privacy and security regulations
establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:

- the circumstances under which use or disclosure of protected health information is permitted
or required without a specific authorization by the patient;

- a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected
health information;

- the requirements to notify patients of privacy practices for protected health information;

- administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive
protected health information; and

- the protection of computing systems that store protected health information.

If we do not adequately safeguard confidential patient data or other protected health
information, or if such information or data are wrongfully used by us or disclosed to an
unauthorized person or entity, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines,
penalties and litigation.

**_Adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an_**
**_adverse impact on our client base and reputation._**
We have been involved, and may be involved in the future, in various legal proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business, including disputes concerning professional liability and
employee-related matters, regulatory matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies
and health insurance carriers regarding, among other things, billing issues. Additionally, from
time to time, disputes may arise with the sellers of businesses we acquire, some of which
continue to hold interests in the company and/or management positions. See “Business—Legal
_Proceedings.” Some of the proceedings against us may involve claims for substantial amounts_
and could divert management’s attention from day to day business operations to address such
issues. Proceedings may result in substantial monetary damages, damage to our reputation and
decreased demand for our services, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business. The ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the
impact of such matters is determined or paid.

46


-----

In some proceedings in which we are involved or could be involved, material amounts are
claimed, or could potentially be claimed, from us or our subsidiaries and affiliates. Any provisions
we set aside in this respect in our financial statements may prove insufficient if we were found
liable, which could have material adverse consequences on our activities and financial position
(particularly on our operating results and cash flow) regardless of whether or not the underlying
claim is well founded.

In general, it is possible that, in the future, new proceedings, whether or not connected with
those currently underway, may be initiated against us, our subsidiaries or our laboratory doctors,
medical doctors or employees. Since such proceedings may be lengthy and costly, they could also,
regardless of their outcome, have adverse consequences on our activities, financial position
(particularly our results and cash position) and outlook.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**
We carry insurance of various types, including workers’ compensation, employment practices,
pension related and general liability coverage. We maintain insurance policies both at the Group
level as well as policies for individual laboratories that we operate through our various
subsidiaries. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are
insurable and there can be no assurance that we will not experience major incidents of a nature
that is not covered by insurance. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe
is adequate, but there can be no assurance that our insurance cover will be sufficient or effective
under all circumstances and against all liabilities to which we may subject. We could, for
example, be subject to substantial claims for damages upon the occurrence of several events
within one calendar year. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to
any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the
insurance market in general. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our
current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.

**_Labor disputes could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs._**
We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which may disrupt our operations. Labor laws
applicable to our business in certain countries, particularly France, are relatively rigorous. In
numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees’ interests. In addition,
some of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable regulations, represented
by work councils or other bodies. In many cases, we must inform, consult with and request the
consent or opinion of union representatives or work councils in managing, developing or
restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative procedures could
limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could
limit our ability to respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are
not mandatory, important strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some
employees and employees’ representative bodies, which could lead to labor actions that could
disrupt our business.

Although we believe our relations with employees are good and French law in particular limits
the ability of workers involved in the provision of healthcare services (which would include
certain of our employees) to go on strike, our operations may nevertheless be materially affected
by strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns or other labor related developments in the future,
which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Our employees in certain countries benefit from collective bargaining
agreements, and we may not be able to periodically renegotiate collective agreements on
acceptable terms. Settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number
of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may adversely affect our labor
costs, productivity and flexibility.

**_The results of some entities are fully consolidated in the financial statements of Cerba_**
**_HealthCare, despite the fact that Cerba HealthCare holds less than 50% of the voting_**
**_rights and less than 100% of the financial rights for such entities._**
The results of our French subsidiaries are fully consolidated in the consolidated balance sheet and
income statement of Cerba HealthCare despite us owning, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of
the voting rights of our French laboratory subsidiaries. See “—We may not exercise full control
_over the operations of certain of our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting_
_interest and are dependent on the clinical pathologists who own a majority voting interest in_
_them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries.” However, although Cefid, our wholly_
owned subsidiary, holds, directly or indirectly, less than a majority of the voting rights in these
French laboratory subsidiaries, the bylaws of these entities allow Cefid to hold, directly or
indirectly, between approximately 70% and 99.99% of the financial rights in such entities, in
certain cases through share capital. However, decisions by such French laboratory subsidiaries to
pay dividends in excess of those required by the bylaws and shareholders’ agreements are not
controlled by us and we may not have access to all the cash in such entities.

In addition, because Cefid owns, directly or indirectly, less than 100% of the financial rights in
certain of our French laboratory subsidiaries, we have access to only a portion of the EBITDA and
assets of these entities.

#### Risks Related to the Acquisition

**_The Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks._**
On February 8, 2017, BidCo entered into the FG Acquisition Agreement to acquire directly or
indirectly from the Sellers substantially all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the
Target and the Sellers’ Bonds and BidCo is expected to enter into the Manco Acquisition
Agreement to acquire shares of Manco from certain managers of the Group prior to the
Acquisition Completion Date. We currently expect the Acquisition to complete at the end of April
2017. The consummation of the Acquisition is, however, subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including clearance by the French Ministère de l’Economie, de l’Industrie et du
_Numérique and antitrust clearance, and the performance of certain closing actions. The parties to_
the Acquisition Agreements will not consummate the Acquisition until the conditions are
fulfilled, which could take several months and, in exceptional circumstances, significantly longer.
Certain subsidiaries or assets of the Target may have to be sold or spun-off in order for the
parties to the FG Acquisition Agreement to obtain clearance by the French Ministère de
_l’Economie, de l’Industrie et du Numérique and antitrust authorities, which might lead to the loss_
of operational benefits and might adversely affect the Group’s financial position. Accordingly,
the parties may not be able to undertake this transaction in a timely fashion, without remedies,
or at all. Any such remedies may make the Acquisition less attractive. Completion of the
Acquisition is one of the conditions to release the proceeds from the Offering from escrow. If the
Acquisition is not consummated on or before the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence
of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption as described
in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and you may
not obtain the return you expect to receive on the Notes. The realization of any risks related to
uncertainties of the Acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

**_The Issuer does not currently control the Target and its subsidiaries and will not_**
**_control the Target and its subsidiaries until completion of the Acquisition._**
The Target and its subsidiaries are currently controlled by PAI. The Issuer will not obtain control
of the Target until completion of the Acquisition. The Sellers may not operate the business of the
Target during the interim period from signing of the Acquisition Agreements until completion of
the Acquisition in the same way that we would. Some information contained in this Offering
Memorandum has been derived from public sources and, in the case of historical information
relating to the Group, has been provided to us by the Sellers, the Target and its subsidiaries, and

48


-----

the Issuer has relied on such information supplied to them in the preparation of this Offering
Memorandum. Furthermore, the Acquisition itself has required, and will likely continue to
require, substantial time and focus from management, which could adversely affect their ability
to operate the business. Likewise, employees may be uncomfortable with the Acquisition or feel
otherwise affected by it, which could have an impact on work quality and retention.

In addition, prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, the Target and its subsidiaries will not be
subject to the covenants described in “Description of the Notes” to be included in the Indenture.
Even though the Target and its subsidiaries will still be subject to the covenants of the Existing
Notes until the redemption or satisfaction and discharge of the Existing Notes on the Acquisition
Completion Date, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date, the Target and its subsidiaries
will not take any action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those
covenants been applicable. Any of the risks associated with the Issuer’s lack of control over the
Target and its subsidiaries until the completion of the Acquisition could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_If the conditions precedent to the release of the escrow proceeds are not satisfied, the_**
**_Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the_**
**_return you expect on the Notes._**
The gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in the Escrow Account, pledged in favor of the
Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, pending the satisfaction of certain conditions,
some of which are outside of our control. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or before the
Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject
to a special mandatory redemption as described in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to_
receive on the Notes.

The escrow proceeds deposited on the Escrow Account will be initially limited to the gross
proceeds of the Offering and will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption
price, which is equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but not including, the date of
special mandatory redemption. In the event that the escrow proceeds are insufficient to pay the
special mandatory redemption price, plus any such accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (directly or indirectly through a wholly
owned subsidiary thereof) and one or more investment funds advised or managed by Partners
Group AG will be required to make an equity contribution in an amount required to enable the
Issuer to pay any funding shortfall, including escrow account fees and costs, accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes pursuant to the
Shortfall Agreement. The obligation of each of the Sponsors to make such equity contributions
will be several, and not joint, and will be made on a pro rata basis in proportion to the Sponsors’
respective total equity commitments in UK TopCo. Under the Shortfall Agreement, the Sponsor
contribution shall be contributed, directly or indirectly, to the capital of the Issuer for deposit
into the Escrow Account. Under no circumstance may the Trustee cause the Sponsor contribution
to be paid directly to the Trustee or any other person. The rights of the Issuer under the Shortfall
Agreement will be pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the Notes.

The holders of the Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the Shortfall Agreement, and
must rely on the Issuer’s sole right to enforcement under the Shortfall Agreement. There can be
no assurance that the relevant investment funds providing such commitment will have sufficient
funds to make these payments.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or
financial position of the Target and its subsidiaries, or the terms of the Acquisition or the
Financing, between the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date, may have an impact on
our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to rescind your decision to invest in the Notes as a
result thereof.

49


-----

**_The Acquisition may entitle our customers and certain other business partners of the_**
**_Group to terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**
The Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by
Cerba HealthCare and its subsidiaries, such as commercial agreements with some of our suppliers,
and will entitle these third parties to terminate their agreements with us or, in some cases,
request adjustments of the terms of the agreements. We cannot exclude the possibility that some
of these third parties may exercise their termination, adjustment or other rights, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position
following the Acquisition. In addition, some of the third parties may use their termination or
adjustment rights to renegotiate the terms of the agreements to our detriment.

**_Amendments made to the Acquisition Agreements may have adverse consequences for_**
**_holders of the Notes._**
The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition
Agreements. The Acquisition Agreements, however, may be amended and the closing conditions
may be waived at any time by the parties thereto, without the consent of holders of the Notes.
Furthermore, any amendments made to the Acquisition Agreements may make the Acquisition
less attractive. Any amendment made to the Acquisition Agreements may be materially adverse
to holders of the Notes, which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on the return you expect to
receive on the Notes.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and_**
**_warranties that the Sellers have provided to us under the Acquisition Agreements._**
In connection with the Acquisition, the Sellers have given certain customary representations and
warranties in the FG Acquisition Agreement related to their shares in the Target and Cerba
HealthCare’s business, subject to significant limitations. We may not be able to enforce any
claims against the Sellers relating to breaches of these representations and warranties. The
Sellers’ liability under the Acquisition Agreements is very limited. Moreover, even if we are able
to eventually recover any losses resulting from a breach of these representations and warranties,
we may temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves. In addition, our ability to enforce
our claims under the warranties and indemnities against the Sellers are dependent on their
creditworthiness at the time we seek to enforce our claims, and there can be no assurances
regarding the financial condition of the Sellers in the future.

**_The Target and/or any of its subsidiaries may have liabilities that are not known to us._**
There may be liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing
due diligence investigations into the Target and its subsidiaries in connection with the
Acquisition. We may learn of additional information about the Target and/or any of its
subsidiaries that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating
to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

#### Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

**_The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies that have no revenue-_**
**_generating operations of their own and will depend on cash from the operating_**
**_companies of our Group to be able to make payments on the Notes or their_**
**_Guarantees._**
The Issuer and certain Guarantors are holding companies with no business operations other than
the equity interests and/or intercompany receivables they hold in each of their subsidiaries. The
Issuer and such Guarantors are dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries
in the form of dividends, interest payments on intercompany loans or other distributions to meet
their obligations, including their obligations under the Notes or their Guarantees. If the
subsidiaries of the Issuer do not fulfill their obligations under certain intercompany loans to
make scheduled payments, the Issuer may not have any other source of funds that would allow it
to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The amounts of such payments, dividends and

50


-----

other distributions available to the Issuer and such Guarantors will depend on the profitability
and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries as well as the ability of those subsidiaries to declare
dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer and such Guarantors, however, may
not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions, make
interest payments on, or otherwise advance upstream loans to the Issuer or such Guarantors to
make payments in respect of their debt, including the Notes and the Guarantees. While the
Indenture will limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to
significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by
applicable law. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have
no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes. Furthermore, with respect to certain
French laboratory subsidiaries, we do not control the decisions of these subsidiaries to make
distributions in excess of the distributions required under the bylaws and shareholders’
agreements of such subsidiaries. Moreover, as we do not own 100% of the financial rights (right
to dividends) and other distributions of these entities, whenever a dividend, distribution or other
payment is made in respect of a French laboratory subsidiary, a portion is paid to the holders of
the relevant minority financial rights.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**
We currently have, and after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant
amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31,
2016, our pro forma net financial debt excluding shareholder debt, as adjusted to give effect to
the Transactions, including the application of proceeds from the Offering and drawings under
the Senior Credit Facilities, would have been €1,051.3 million, which reflects external
interest-bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. See “Capitalization.” In
addition, our Revolving Credit Facility (which we do not expect to be drawn on the Acquisition
Completion Date) provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of €175.0 million, subject to
certain conditions. Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business
and operations and for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our
other debts and liabilities;

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on
our debt, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, organic growth
projects and for other general corporate purposes;

- increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry
conditions;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or
greater financial resources than we have;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business
and industry;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

- restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;
and

- limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in
the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and

51


-----

refinance our debt and to fund acquisitions, working capital expenditures and other expenses
will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations.
Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic,
competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We
may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to
service our debt or to fund our future acquisitions or other working capital expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including debt in
connection with future acquisitions. The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the
Indenture will permit our subsidiaries to do so, in each case, subject to certain limitations. If new
debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face could intensify. For a
discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us_**
**_to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**
We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Indenture and the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these
restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under
certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. Under the Indenture, in addition to specified permitted debt,
we are, or will be, able to incur additional debt so long as our consolidated fixed charge
coverage ratio (as defined in the Indenture) on a pro forma basis is at least 2.00 to 1.00. In the
event such debt is Secured Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement),
our Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement) on a pro forma basis is no more than 5.50 to 1.00. We are also able to refinance debt
outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement with debt incurred in compliance with
these ratios and then be able to draw amounts under our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement at a
time when we do not meet these ratios. The terms of the Indenture will permit us to incur future
debt that may have substantially the same covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive
than, those of the Indenture. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be
structurally senior to the Notes or may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes
and the Guarantees. In addition, the Indenture and our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement do not
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those agreements. The
incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this Offering
Memorandum.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants which limit our operating, strategic and_**
**_financial flexibility._**
Our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will contain covenants which impose
significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures or
undertaking capital expenditures;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create unrestricted subsidiaries;

- agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions;

52


-----

- sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

- sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis;

- issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries;

- impair the Security Interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

- create or incur certain liens.

These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react
to market conditions or regulatory developments or take advantage of potential business
opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to
finance our operations, pursue acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization
or finance our capital needs or such acquisitions.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement_**
**_or the Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an_**
**_event of default which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition_**
**_and results of operations._**
The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will require us to comply with various
covenants, including a springing financial covenant in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility
requiring us to maintain a specified leverage ratio and which is tested when loans under the
Revolving Credit Facility aggregate 40% of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit
Facility on the last day of a financial quarter. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior
_Credit Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet this financial ratio could be affected by_
deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including, without
limitation, decreases in tariffs or reimbursements for laboratory testing services and unfavorable
economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet this ratio.
Moreover, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement includes certain events of default (including,
amongst other things, events of default for breaches of representations and warranties and an
event of default for our failure to make principal payments when due on certain other debt) that
are in addition to the events of default set forth in the Indenture. Subject to a clean-up period
lasting until the date falling 180 days after the Acquisition Completion Date (or 120 days
following any other permitted acquisition), if an event of default occurs and is continuing under
the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the agent under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (if
directed by the majority lenders thereunder (or majority lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility in the case of a financial covenant default)) could amongst other things, terminate any
available facilities, cancel any undrawn commitments and declare all amounts borrowed,
together with accrued and unpaid interest and any other sums then payable, to be immediately
due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the Notes, that contain
cross-acceleration or cross- default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on
demand in the event that acceleration occurs under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. In
these circumstances, our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt and
our other debt, including the Notes then outstanding, if some or all of these instruments were
accelerated, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to
repay our obligations under the Notes in such an event.

Furthermore, we do not control a majority of the voting shares of a number of our French
laboratory subsidiaries. As such, any such French laboratory subsidiary could take unilateral
actions that we cannot control that could cause a breach of our covenants under the Indenture
and an event of default.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or sustain our_**
**_operations, including due to factors outside our control, and may be forced to take_**
**_other actions to satisfy our debt obligations, which may not be successful._**
Our ability to make payments on or to refinance the Notes or our other debt obligations, and to
fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance
and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on general economic, financial, competitive,
market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our
debt obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debt, including
the Notes, or to fund our liquidity needs. If our future cash flows from operations and other
capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs,
we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before
maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial
condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our
current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further
restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the
Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be
unable to find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might
not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance our debt,
obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not
be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In that event, borrowings
under other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration
provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all
our debts, including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding debt on a
timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to
incur additional debt. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations
to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our debt, including under the
Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets. We may not be able to consummate
certain dispositions or obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such
dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to
meet our debt service obligations then due.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**
We are subject to complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position,
including our effective tax rate or tax payments. We often rely on generally available
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the

54


-----

relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax
positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could
require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services
to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax
rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The
occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a_**
**_portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash_**
**_flow available to service our indebtedness._**
Under Article 212 § II of the French Code général des impôts (the “French Tax Code”), deductions
of interest paid on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the
French Tax Code or on loans granted by a third party but guaranteed by a related party (third
party assimilated to a related party) may be subject to certain limitations. Deductions of interest
paid on such loans may be partially disallowed in the fiscal year during which it is incurred if such
interest exceeds each of the following thresholds: (i) the amount of interest multiplied by the
ratio of (a) 1.5 times the company’s net equity and (b) the average amount of indebtedness owed
to related parties (or to third parties assimilated to related parties) over the relevant fiscal year;
(ii) 25% of the company’s earnings before tax (as increased by certain items for the purpose of
these limitations); and (iii) the amount of interest received by the company from related parties
(or from third parties assimilated to related parties). Deduction may be disallowed for the
portion of interest that exceeds in a relevant fiscal year the highest of the above three limitations
if such portion of interest exceeds €150,000, unless the company is able to demonstrate for the
relevant fiscal year that the indebtedness ratio of the group to which it belongs is higher or
equal to its own indebtedness ratio. Moreover, specific rules apply to companies that belong to a
French tax consolidated group (intégration fiscale).

The Notes, which will be guaranteed by certain of the Issuer’s affiliates, may therefore be
considered, in whole or in part, as related party debt with respect to such Issuer. As a result,
deductions by the Issuer of interest paid in respect of the Notes may be limited. In addition,
similar thin capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries for any
amount of the proceeds of the Bidco Proceeds Loan as well as the Cerba Proceeds Loans made
available to the latter by means of intragroup loans.

In addition, Article 209 § IX of the French Tax Code imposes restrictions on the deductibility of
interest expenses incurred by a French company if such company has acquired shares of another
company qualifying as “titres de participation” within the meaning of Article 219 § I a quinquies
of the French Tax Code and if such acquiring company cannot demonstrate, with respect to the
fiscal year in which the shares are acquired or the fiscal years running over a twelve-month
period from the acquisition of such shares (or with respect to the first fiscal year opened after
January 1, 2012 for shares acquired during a fiscal year opened prior to such date), that (i) the
decisions relating to such acquired shares are actually taken by the company having acquired
them (or, as the case may be, by a company controlling the acquiring company or by a company
directly controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of Article L 233-3 § I of the
French Code de commerce (the “French Commercial Code”), that is located in France) and
(ii) where control or an influence is exercised over the acquired company, such control or
influence is exercised by the acquiring company (or, as the case may be, by a company controlling
the acquiring company or by a company directly controlled by such controlling company, within
the meaning of Article L 233-3 § I of the French Commercial Code, that is located in France).

We do not expect that this interest deduction limitation would apply to us because the Issuer and
Bidco should be able to prove that they would actually (i) take the decisions regarding the shares
in the Target and (ii) exercise control over the Target. However, this tax legislation and the
related guidelines published by the French tax authorities (BOI-IS-BASE-35-30-10-20140325 and

55


-----

BOI-IS-BASE-35-30-20-20130329) remain quite vague and subject to significant uncertainties as to
their interpretation. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the French tax authorities
would not disagree with our position regarding the tax treatment or characterization of the
indebtedness of the Group and that this tax legislation would not limit the deductibility of
interest on the indebtedness of the Group.

Moreover, Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code provides for a general limitation of deductibility
of net financial charges, subject to certain exceptions. 25% of the adjusted net financial charges
incurred by French companies that are subject to French corporate income tax and are not
members of a French tax consolidated group (intégration fiscale) are added-back to their taxable
result, to the extent that such companies’ net financial charges (i.e. financial charges decreased
by certain financial income) are at least equal to €3 million in a given fiscal year. Under
Article 223 B bis of the French Tax Code, similar rules apply to companies that belong to a French
tax consolidated group (intégration fiscale). 25% of the adjusted aggregated net financial
charges incurred by companies that are members of a French tax consolidated group (intégration
_fiscale) with respect to loans granted by lenders that are not members of such tax consolidated_
group are added back to the French tax consolidated group’s taxable result, to the extent that
the tax consolidated group companies’ aggregated net financial charges are at least equal to
€3 million in a given fiscal year.

Finally, Article 212 § I(b) of the French Tax Code provides for an “anti-hybrid” limitation. If the
lender is a related party to the borrower within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax
Code, the borrower must demonstrate, at the French tax authorities’ request, that the lender is,
for the current fiscal year and with respect to the interest concerned, subject to an income tax at
least equal to 25% of the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules.
Where such lender is domiciled or established outside France, the “corporate income tax
determined under standard French tax rules” means the corporate income tax liability to which
the lender would have been liable in France on the interest received if it had been domiciled or
established in France. Specific rules apply where the lender is a pass-through entity for French tax
purposes or a collective investment scheme referred to in Articles L. 214-1 to L. 214-191 of the
French Monetary and Financial Code (which includes UCITSs and AIFs as well as other collective
investment schemes such as SICAVs and SPPICAVs with a single shareholder) or, subject to certain
conditions, a similar entity organized under a foreign law.

Considering this legislation and guidelines published by the French tax authorities (BOI-IS-BASE35-50-20140805 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-10-20140805), this interest deduction limitation should not
apply to us. However, we cannot provide any assurance that the French tax authorities would not
disagree with our position and that this tax legislation would not limit the deductibility of
interest on the indebtedness of the Group.

On July 12, 2016, the Council adopted Directive 2016/1164/EU laying down rules against tax
avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market (the “ATAD
Directive”). The ATAD Directive provides inter alia for a rule limiting the deductibility of interest
to 30% of the EBITDA (the “Interest Limitation Rule”). In principle, Member States shall
transpose the ATAD Directive by December 31, 2018. However, Member States which have
national targeted rules for preventing BEPS risks at August 8, 2016, which are equally effective to
the Interest Limitation Rule, may apply these targeted rules until the end of the first full fiscal
year following the date of publication of the agreement between the OECD members on the
official website on a minimum standard with regard to BEPS Action 4, but at the latest until
January 1, 2024. It is unclear whether the Interest Limitation Rule would be added to the interest
limitation rules already in force in France or replace (at least part of) them.

The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our
indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash
flow available to service our indebtedness.

56


-----

**_French tax legislation may restrict our ability to use French tax loss carry forwards._**
We may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting
from discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in
respect of tax loss carry forwards from our entities. The actual realization of these assets in future
years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits, and on the
future results of the relevant entities. In particular, pursuant Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the
French Tax Code, tax losses incurred in a given tax year may be offset against the taxable profits
of the following tax year up to €1 million plus 50% of the portion of the taxable profits
exceeding €1 million. Unused tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely (subject to certain
exceptions) under the same conditions. Any reduction in our ability to use these assets due to
changes in laws and regulations, potential tax reassessments or lower than expected results could
have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks, and such rates may adversely affect our debt_**
**_service obligations._**
A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we will be exposed to the risk of
fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Senior Term Loan and the Revolving Credit
Facility, which are based on, in respect of the Senior Term Loan, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(EURIBOR) and, in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, either EURIBOR in respect of
utilizations in EUR or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for all other utilisations (in each
case, subject to a zero per cent per annum floor) and in each case plus an applicable margin.
These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense
associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and
hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither our Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement nor the Indenture contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our
floating rate debt.

**_We could be adversely affected by changes to the composition of the Eurozone._**
A deterioration in general economic conditions caused by instability in the Eurozone could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
If one or more countries default on their debt obligations and/or cease using the euro, there may
be significant, extended and generalized dislocation in the financial markets and in the wider
European economy, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition, especially as our operations are primarily in Europe. In addition, the departure of one
or more countries from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of, inter alia, exchange rate
control laws. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for
holders of euro- denominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions
referencing the euro would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential
developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect
our trading environment and/or the value of the Notes and could have adverse consequences for
us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated and, as we have
a substantial amount of debt denominated in euro, our financial condition may be materially
affected.

Furthermore, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved
an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” As a result of the
referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the
UK’s withdrawal from the EU during 2017. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt
the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the EU, undermine
bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the UK and the EU
and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the EU, including in our main
markets such as France. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial,
trade and legal implications Brexit would have and despite our currently limited exposure to the
UK, whether our business, financial position and results of operations will be materially adversely
affected.

57


-----

Furthermore, the Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contain covenants
restricting our and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities. See “—We are subject to restrictive
_covenants which limit our operating, strategic and financial flexibility.” Certain of such covenants_
impose limitations based on euro amounts (e.g., the amount of additional debt we or our
subsidiaries may incur). As such, if the euro were to significantly decrease in value, the
restrictions imposed by these covenants would become tighter, further restricting our ability to
finance our operations and conduct our day- to-day business.

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of_**
**_holders of the Notes._**
Following the completion of the Acquisition, the Sponsors will indirectly control the Group. See
“Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions.” As a result, the Sponsors will have,
directly or indirectly, the power to affect, among other things, our legal and capital structure and
our day- to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to
approve other changes to our operations. In addition, for compliance with certain restrictive
covenants, we will depend upon the cooperation of our principal shareholders who have the
power to effect compliance with such covenants. The interests of the Sponsors and their affiliates
could conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Affiliates of the Sponsors also have an
interest in pursuing divestitures, financings or other transactions that in their judgment could
enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to holders of
the Notes. In addition, the Sponsors or their affiliates may, in the future, own businesses that
directly compete with ours or do business with us.

#### Risks Related to the Notes

**_The_** **_Notes_** **_will_** **_be_** **_structurally_** **_subordinated_** **_to_** **_the_** **_liabilities_** **_of_** **_non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that_**
**_do not secure the Notes._**
Certain of our subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. Our subsidiaries will not have any
obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose
unless they guarantee the Notes or grant Security Interests in this respect. Generally, holders of
debt of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank
financing agreements, are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries
before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct
or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

- the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be
entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary
before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to
receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each related Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. The
subsidiaries of Cerba HealthCare that will not guarantee the Notes generated 23.3% of our
EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, and held 35.6% of our total assets (excluding
goodwill, equity investments in subsidiaries and intercompany transactions) as of December 31,
2016. As of December 31, 2016, our subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Notes had total debt, when
excluding shareholder debt, the Existing Notes and the Sellers’ Bonds (each of which we expect

58


-----

to repay as part of the Transactions) and intercompany loans, of €35.3 million. This amount will
rank structurally senior to the Notes and the related Guarantees. The Indenture, subject to
certain limitations, will permit these non-Guarantors to incur additional indebtedness, which may
also be secured. An aggregate amount of €107.3 million of existing debt (as of December 31,
2016, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions) will not be subject to the Refinancing
and remain outstanding. A portion of this total amount is secured on property or assets that do
not form part of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes will be effectively subordinated
to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness. See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness.”_

Any of the debt that our non-guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the
Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the related Guarantees and any debt we
incur that is secured on property or assets that do not form part of the Collateral securing the
Notes will be effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets
securing such indebtedness.

**_Your right to receive payment under the Guarantees is contractually subordinated to_**
**_senior debt._**
The obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees will be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all existing and future
obligations in respect of senior debt of such Guarantor. This senior debt includes the obligations
under the Senior Credit Facilities. Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability
of the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and
senior to the guarantees.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor in respect of an insolvency event,
the holders of senior debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of
such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such guarantee. Until the senior
debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Notes would be
entitled but for the subordination provisions to be included in the Intercreditor Agreement shall
instead be made to holders of senior debt of such Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a
result, in the event of insolvency of a Guarantor, holders of senior debt of such Guarantor may
recover more, ratably, than the holders of Notes, in respect of the Guarantor’s guarantee in
respect thereof.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the
Guarantees will provide:

- customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Notes for the benefit of
the holders of senior debt of such Guarantor;

- that if a payment default on any senior debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing,
such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its guarantee until such default is
cured or waived;

- that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness that
permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such
default, such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Notes, or pursuant to its
Guarantee, until (amongst others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and
179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and

- that the holders of the Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the
majority senior secured creditors or the majority super senior creditors, from taking any
enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances.

The Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee
will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees.

59


-----

Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the
Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Guarantor and
by accepting any Note each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse under
the Guarantees in the event of a default by the Issuer or a Guarantor.

**_Your security over the Collateral ranks behind the security benefiting the lenders_**
**_under the Senior Credit Facilities._**
All of the Collateral (other than the charge over the escrow proceeds of the Offering and the
rights of the Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement) is pledged to the Security Agent for the
benefit of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities in addition to being pledged to the
Security Agent for the benefit of holders of the Notes. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents, the Senior Credit Facilities are secured by first-ranking security interests
in all of the Collateral (other than the charge over the escrow proceeds of the Offering and the
rights of the Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement) and the proceeds of any sale of such
Collateral (other than the charge over the escrow proceeds of the Offering and the rights of the
Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement) on enforcement will be applied first to repay all debt of
the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and certain hedging obligations. Consequently, you
may not be able to recover on such Collateral because the lenders under the Senior Credit
Facilities and the counterparties to certain hedging obligations will have a prior claim on all
proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Collateral.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**
The Notes will be secured by the Collateral which will also secure the obligations under our
Senior Credit Facilities and certain hedging liabilities. In addition, under the terms of the
Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional pari passu indebtedness and other
obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the security agent, who will serve as the Security
Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless
otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group. For the purposes of enforcement, “Instructing
Group” means, in the context of our capital structure upon consummation of the Transactions,
more than 50% by value of the total senior secured credit participations under the Senior Credit
Facilities, certain hedge counter-parties at that time, any other additional pari passu
indebtedness that may be secured on such collateral (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”).
The Majority Senior Secured Creditors may have interests that are different from the interests of
holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to
pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous
for the holders of the Notes to do so. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under_**
**_certain circumstances._**
In the event of an enforcement of the Security Documents, the proceeds from the sale of the
assets underlying the Security Documents may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral
has been made in connection with these Offering. The value of the Collateral will also depend on
many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going
concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an
orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the
availability of buyers.

The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares

60


-----

and intercompany loan receivables may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less
than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be salable or, if
salable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in
certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, include restrictions on persons who may
own or operate clinical laboratories. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of clinical
laboratories (or the ownership of an entity holding clinical laboratories) may be prohibited or
only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the
pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, the transfer of clinical laboratories may require, in certain
jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings. Such consents,
approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result,
enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of
the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it
is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of debt
secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares pledged to secure the Notes and the
Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of
the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little
or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the
shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In
addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are
not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not
repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured claim
against the Issuer and a senior subordinated and unsecured claim against the Guarantors.

The Indenture will permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of
the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third parties
enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security
Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under
the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional
notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby,
thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_The Guarantees and the Security Interests over the Collateral may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect_**
**_their validity and enforceability._**
The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in France and Luxembourg and the enforcement
of each such Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such
Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such
Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or grantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of
such guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or grantor, or such guarantee
would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules, financial assistance rules
or any other general statutory laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor,
in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. The
grant of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent may also be voidable by the grantor or by an
insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be
otherwise set aside by a court, if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among
others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits
the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an
insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified
“claw-back” period following the grant.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Guarantee or Security Interest against the relevant
Guarantor/grantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors/grantor of
security interests generally and to limitations contained in the terms of the Indenture or the

61


-----

documents governing the Collateral designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements
applicable to the relevant Guarantors or grantors, as applicable. As a result, a Guarantor’s and a
grantor’s liability under its Guarantee and in respect of the security interests granted by it,
respectively, could be materially reduced or eliminated altogether, depending upon the law
applicable to it and facts and circumstances at the time of enforcement.

There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions, including France, as to whether
obligations to beneficial owners of the Security Interests that are not identified as registered
holders in a security document will be validly secured. Under French law, the beneficiary of a
security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the relevant security document. The
fact that the direct beneficiary of the French security will be the Security Agent and not the
holders of the Notes from time to time, could imply that the pledge may not be validly and fully
enforceable by the holders of the Notes who are not a direct party to the relevant pledge
agreements creating the security interest. Furthermore, under French law a pledge granted for
the benefit of creditors in respect of whom the perfection formalities have not been fully or
validly carried out or for the benefit of persons who are not effectively creditors of the relevant
secured claim may not be enforceable. If a challenge to the validity or enforceability of the
security interest created by the Security Documents subject to French law brought on the above
grounds were to be successful, the holders of the Notes could be unable to recover any amounts
under such security interests.

In addition, the granting of new Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes
may create hardening periods for such Security Interests in France and Luxembourg (save for
financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005
on financial collateral arrangements, as amended). Under French law, hardening periods are
created when an entity organized under French law grants security, even if the governing law of
the instrument creating the security interest is not, as applicable, French law (for example, share
pledges of the shares of a non-French entity by a French entity). The applicable hardening period
for these new Security Interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been
granted or perfected. The Indenture will permit the Security Interests in the Collateral to be
released and retaken in certain circumstances. Such release and retaking will restart the
applicable hardening periods. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to
be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it
may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, the grantor of Security Interests, or
the creditor thereof, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or
grantor of such Security Interests, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s
Guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the
Guarantee or the Security Interests should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed
limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor and/or grantor, including trade
payables of such Guarantor and/or grantor, as applicable. Future Guarantees and/or Security
Interests may be subject to similar limitations. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees_**
**_may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or_**
**_security interests in the Collateral._**

The Guarantors or grantors of Security Interests are incorporated under the laws of France and
Luxembourg. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against the Guarantors or the
enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral against a grantor of Security Interests will be
subject to certain defenses available to the Guarantors or grantors of Security Interests in the
relevant jurisdiction, as the case may be.

62


-----

Although laws differ in these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses may include those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, voidable
preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization,
capital maintenance or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Guarantors may have no
liability or decreased liability under their respective Guarantees or the security interest in the
Collateral may be void or may not be enforceable depending on the amounts of its other
obligations, applicable law and facts and circumstances at the time of enforcement. Limitations
on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit
the enforceability of the Guarantees against the Guarantors or security interest in the Collateral
against any Guarantor.

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

- certain exceptions, including to the extent any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute
prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Code de
Commerce or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning of article L.
241-3, L. 242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Code de Commerce, it being specified that under
French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of
another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition; and

- a contractual financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the
Offering of the Notes which the Issuer has applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each
French Guarantor and/or the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor through the
intercompany loans and cash pooling arrangements that are outstanding on the date a
payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee or security
and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that
the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court
found that the French guarantor or security provider did not derive an overall corporate benefit
from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. The existence of
a real and adequate corporate benefit to the guarantor or security provider and whether the
amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which
French case law provides no clear guidance. French case law has recognized that certain
intragroup transactions (including upstream guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the
relevant company, in particular, where the following criteria are fulfilled:

- the existence of a genuine group of companies (taken as a whole, not just its shareholders)
operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective;

- the existence of a common economic, social or financial interests of the group within the
framework of a policy implemented by the group of companies;

- the transaction shall not be without due consideration and compensation and shall not change
the existing balance between the respective obligations of the relevant companies;

- the risk assumed by a French guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;

- the French guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage
from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee; and

- the obligations of the French guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial
capability.

63


-----

Accordingly, the Guarantees by the French Guarantors are limited to amounts recoverable
thereunder that represent either (i) the amount of debt made available directly or indirectly to
that French Guarantor or its subsidiaries with the proceeds of Indebtedness previously incurred
by a holding company of such French Guarantor to the extent that such Indebtedness is or has
been refinanced directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Indebtedness of the Issuer constituting
Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which term includes the Notes
offered hereby (See “Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees”); and (ii) the amounts of
the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such French Guarantor, and the controlled
subsidiaries of that French Guarantor, through the intercompany loans, via the Group’s cashpooling arrangements or otherwise, and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be
made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantee. Any payment made by such French
Guarantor under its guarantee or under the intercompany loans or the cash pooling
arrangements will reduce the maximum amount of its guarantee. By virtue of this limitation, a
French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation
under its Guarantee.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic
return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction
entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and
that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the
Guarantees and Security Interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security
_Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of France and other applicable jurisdictions_**
**_may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of_**
**_another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees_**
**_and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely_**
**_affect their validity and enforceability._**
Our obligations under the Notes will be initially guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by
Security Interests over the Collateral. The Issuer is organized under the laws of France and the
Guarantors and grantors of Security Interests are organized under the laws of France and
Luxembourg. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over shares in Bidco incorporated in
France and a second-ranking pledge of receivables held by the Issuer.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to
your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar.
In particular, the French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many
respects. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or any other of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries, or any other grantor of Security Interests, experiences financial difficulty, it is
not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In the event of a
bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of
these jurisdictions. Proceedings could also be initiated in France to enforce your rights against
Collateral located in this jurisdiction. Such proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for
creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement
of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you will be able to enforce your rights
effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition,
while the Luxembourg Guarantor conducts the majority of its business in Luxembourg, to the
extent that its centre of main interests is deemed to be in France, it would be subject to French
insolvency proceedings (notwithstanding the opening of territorial proceedings in the relevant
jurisdictions), including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings)
and court-controlled insolvency proceedings (sauvegarde), accelerated financial safeguard

64


-----

proceedings (sauvegarde financière accélérée), or reorganization or liquidation proceedings
(redressement or liquidation judiciaire). In general, French insolvency legislation favors the
continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and
could limit the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of a Guarantor’s, a grantor
of Security Interest’s, the Issuer’s, jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from,
or in conflict with, those of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the
ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these
laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s
law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, Guarantees
and Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give
the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the
Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of
the Notes priority (according to their respective rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such
realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to
avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral. See
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of
judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes
against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability
of the Security Interests. The court may also in certain circumstances avoid the Security Interest or
the Guarantee where the company is close to or near insolvency.

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside
insolvency proceedings, the “action paulienne” provisions. The action paulienne provision offers
creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a
person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which the person guarantees
the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for
any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside
insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du_
_plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant_
person outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties
under French law if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the
creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was
prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was
performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known
that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of
recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (“à titre gratuit”) in which case
such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of
fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the Security
Interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that
did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the
granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such guarantee could be
declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who

65


-----

lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders
of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in
the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect
to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be subject to
recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition,
under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by
prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the
Guarantees and Security Interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security
_Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledge forming part of the Collateral_**
**_may be complicated, involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate._**
In connection with the enforcement of the share pledge over the shares of Bidco, any sale of
Bidco is likely to involve a release of primary debt, which could result in a taxable capital gain to
Bidco. As Bidco will be the borrower of our Senior Credit Facilities, an enforcement over the
shares of Bidco would involve the enforcement over an entity with outstanding primary debt
claims. Such release is permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement and could result in a taxable
capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the
enforcement of the share pledge over the shares of Bidco. Therefore, the value of the pledge
over the shares of Bidco is limited. In addition, the holders of the Notes do not share in the other
collateral that has been granted in favor of the creditors of our senior secured liabilities.
Collateral has been granted in favor of such creditors over the shares of certain of our
subsidiaries, some of whom may have outstanding primary debt claims. The release of such
primary debt claims upon the enforcement of such share pledges (which is permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement could also result in a taxable capital gain to such entities. This taxable
capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of our recovery from the enforcement of such share
pledges which, as a consequence, may further reduce the value of the share pledge over Bidco
which forms part of the Collateral.

**_In the event the Acquisition is not consummated, the Issuer will be required to redeem_**
**_the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**
The Acquisition must be consummated no later than the Escrow Longstop Date. If the Acquisition
is not consummated for any reason prior to the first business day following September 30, 2017,
the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption as described in “Description of the
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” and you may not obtain the return_
you expected to receive or the Notes.

The gross proceeds from the Offering will not be sufficient to pay the full redemption price of
the Notes to the holders of the Notes. The gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in the
Escrow Account pending the closing of the Acquisition. Although pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, the Issuer will agree to pay the interest and additional amounts, if any, that
accrue while the gross proceeds remain in the Escrow Account, there can be no assurance that
such interest and additional amounts, if any, will be paid in a timely fashion, if at all. In the event
that the escrow funds are insufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, plus any
such accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, certain investment funds advised or
managed by the Sponsors will be required, on a several, pro rata basis, to make equity
contributions in an amount requirement to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or
financial condition of Cerba, or the terms of the Acquisition or the financing thereof, between
the closing of the Offering and the Acquisition Completion Date, may have an impact on our
creditworthiness, and you will not be able to rescind your decision to invest in the Notes as a
result thereof.

66


-----

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds_**
**_in a comparable security._**
In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor_
who receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such
proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the
Notes.

**_The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum does not cover the_**
**_Issuer._**
We have not included any financial statements of the Issuer either on a standalone basis or
consolidated with its subsidiaries in this Offering Memorandum. Although the Issuer, HoldCo,
TopCo and UK TopCo do not engage in any activities other than those relating to holding the
shares of their subsidiaries, these entities may have external liabilities which are not
subordinated to the Notes and have experienced losses in the past and may do so in the future.
The limited information that we have provided regarding these external liabilities and losses on
an unconsolidated basis is not based on IFRS accounts in all cases and thus may not be
comparable to, and could differ significantly from, such information prepared on the basis of
IFRS. As the financial information of Cerba HealthCare that is presented in this Offering
Memorandum does not include the results of the Issuer, HoldCo, TopCo and UK HoldCo, such
financial information may be of limited use in assessing the financial position of the Issuer.

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer._**
The Indenture requires us to make an offer to purchase the Notes at 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase if
we experience certain specified change of control events. The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
also requires us to make an offer to lenders thereunder to repay them at par if we experience
certain specified change of control events. The source of funds for any offer to purchase Notes,
or repay lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, required as a result of any such
event would be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources,
including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by our subsidiaries.
Sufficient funds may not be available at the time of any such events to make any required
purchases of the Notes tendered and we may not be able to secure access to enough cash to
finance the required purchases of the Notes tendered. Our failure to effect a change of control
offer when required would constitute an event of default under the Indenture.

Further, if pursuant to a change of control offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes,
the Indenture will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at
a price of 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a
consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender the Notes against their will at a
price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected.

Under the definition contained in the Indenture governing the Notes, a change of control may
include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is
required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. Furthermore, certain important corporate
events that might adversely affect the value of the Notes (including certain reorganizations,
restructurings and mergers) would not constitute a “change of control” under the Indenture.
Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of

67


-----

control under the Indenture will not be deemed to be a change of control if at the time our
consolidated net leverage ratio is less than a certain specified level. For a complete description of
the events that would constitute a “change of control” under the Notes, see the sections entitled
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which_**
**_the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically_**
**_without your consent or the Trustee or Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**
Under a variety of circumstances set forth in the Indenture governing the Notes and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically,
including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate
the asset sale covenant of the Indenture, and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted
under the Intercreditor Agreement. Additionally, Collateral securing the Notes and Guarantees
could be released if the acquisition of any entity that subsequently becomes a Guarantor or a
security provider under the Indenture is rescinded. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” The
Indenture will permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as
unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes
of the Indenture, all the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees of
the Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions.
Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral
securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of
its subsidiaries.

**_Security over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly_**
**_to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral_**
**_may be restricted by local law._**
Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as rights of pledge require that the
pledgee and the creditor are the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of
third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes
from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial
holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”)
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the
holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The
Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the
Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes
the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the applicable Notes.
The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly
secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The
holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security
interests except through the Security Agent.

None of the Parallel Debt and trust mechanism constructs have been generally recognized by
French courts and to the extent that the Notes or security interests created under the Parallel
Debt and/or trust constructs are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will
not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests in the
Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n° 10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond
documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in
France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security

68


-----

agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof
of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene
French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the
basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result
of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal
practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such
circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before
French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the
proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests
securing a Parallel Debt. Case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis.
Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France
of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that
the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt
construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the
Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass.
com. September 13, 2011 n[o] 10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust
governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in
safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived
from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law
applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been
generally recognized under French law. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—France.”_

**_Investors’ rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect_**
**_Security Interests in the Collateral._**
Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be
properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured
party or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be
perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we or the Security Agent fail or are unable to
take the actions we or the Security Agent are required to take to perfect any of these liens.

**_You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the securities_**
**_account by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of securities_**
**_rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction._**
Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only be
enforced following a payment default (including following acceleration) and may only secure up
to the secured amount which is due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a
public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the
judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which
the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. Enforcement by way of
private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore, holders of
the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method.

If the secured creditors chose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or
contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of

69


-----

the foreclosed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial
foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure
(pacte commissoire). In a proceeding regarding a judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or a
contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire), an expert is appointed to value the collateral (in this
case, the securities) and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the
secured creditors may be required to pay the pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between
the value of the securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the
actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of
the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such
securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the
securities, an enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public
auction in accordance with applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed
for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in
any such auction might not reflect the value of our Group as a going concern.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**
The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their investment
returns by reference to a currency other than euros (“reference currency”), an investment in the
Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant
changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which such investors
measure the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic, political and
other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against an investor’s
reference currency could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated
coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated
into their reference currency. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S.
dollars by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign
exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold_**
**_securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**
One or more independent credit rating agencies have assigned and may in the future assign
credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to
the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect
the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and
may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or
that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any
time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may
adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect
the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law_**
**_violations._**
The Issuer and substantially all of its subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, are organized outside
the United States, and their business is conducted primarily outside the United States. The
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United
States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York
courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the applicable Indenture,

70


-----

you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and
executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, because a majority of the assets
of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries (to the extent applicable) and
all or a majority of the assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the
United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them.
Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. See “Service of Process and
_Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”_

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters
with France or Luxembourg. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in France or
Luxembourg of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S.
judgment in France or Luxembourg. In addition, the enforcement in France or Luxembourg of
any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely
upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a
French or Luxembourg court would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies
sought in an original action brought in France or in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. securities
laws violations. For further information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil
_Liabilities.”_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and_**
**_the price at which they may be sold._**
Because the Notes and the Guarantees have not been, or will not be, and are not required to be,
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may
not be offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, outside
the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to
resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of
the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.
See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on_**
**_the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**
The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the Global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive
registered form will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited
circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes.
The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered
holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other
amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the
paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these
payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global
Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the
payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must
rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any
rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other

71


-----

actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be
permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear
and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be
sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under an Indenture, unless and until
definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own
book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Channel Islands Securities_**
**_Exchange Authority Limited._**
Although the Issuer will, in the Indenture, agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
have the Notes listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted to trading thereon and to
maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the
Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and
the admission to trading thereon or it determines that it will not maintain such listing, the Issuer
may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Exchange, provided that it will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on
another recognized stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be
able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing
on the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance
with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the
Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material
adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to_**
**_sell the Notes will be limited._**
The Notes are new issues of securities for which there is currently no established market. We
cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell the Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell the Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity
of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market
for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject
to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the
Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes,
regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that
they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offering. However, they have no
obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. In
addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities
Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading
market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell the
Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the_**
**_Notes._**
On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s
Proposal”) for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France,

72


-----

Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the “Participating Member States”). However,
Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain
dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both
within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain
dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution established in a
Participating Member State, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State.
A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member
State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in
a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the
dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It
may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear.
Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are
advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax_**
**_purposes._**
If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds the issue price by an amount equal to or
greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will be considered to be
issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are
issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest on a Note, a U.S. Holder (as defined in
_“Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) will generally be required_
to include the OID on such Note in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant
yield-to-maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in advance of the receipt of the cash
payments to which such OID is attributable and regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations.”

# Use of Proceeds

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be €180.0 million. Pending
the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from
the Offering into the Escrow Account for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The gross
proceeds of the Offering will be used, together with the proceeds of the Senior Term Loan and
the Equity Contribution, to fund the consideration payable for the Acquisition, repay certain
existing indebtedness of the Group and pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Transactions, including estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Offering. See “Summary—The Transactions.”

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions
are shown in the table below, assuming that the Acquisition and the Refinancing complete on
April 30, 2017. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors,
including accrued interest on debt being repaid, differences from our estimates of fees and
expenses associated with the Transactions and fees and expenses actually incurred, the actual
Acquisition Completion Date and the actual date of redemption of the Existing Notes and
repayment of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness. Any changes
in these amounts may affect the amount of the Equity Contribution.

(1) Represents (i) the indirect cash investment expected to be made by the Sponsors in the amount of approximately
€743.3 million (approximately €10.0 million of which will be reserved for future management participation in the Group pursuant
to a management equity participation program) and (ii) the contribution by certain managers of the Group of all or part of their
existing investments in the Target and Manco in the amount of approximately €44.1 million, each of which will be contributed
through wholly owned or majority owned intermediate holding companies to BidCo.

(2) Represents the total cash purchase price payable under the Acquisition Agreements, which includes the repayment of the
Sellers’ Bonds in the amount of €4.3 million.

redemption price for the Existing Senior Secured Notes will be €1,017.50 per €1,000.0 in aggregate principal amount of Existing
Senior Secured Notes and the redemption price for the Existing Senior Notes will be €1,020.63 per €1,000.0 in aggregate principal
amount of Existing Senior Notes.

(7) Represents estimated accrued interest including (i) €10.0 million of interest accrued on the Existing Senior Secured Notes from
February 1, 2017 through to April 30, 2017, (ii) €2.5 million of interest accrued on the Existing Senior Notes from February 15,

2017 through to April 30, 2017, (iii) €0.1 million of interest accrued on the Existing Revolving Credit Facility through to April 30,
2017, and (iv) €1.5 million of non-capitalized accrued interest on the Existing Management Vendor Loans through to April 30,
2017.

(8) Includes estimated expenses in connection with the Transactions, including discounts, commissions and commitment,
placement, advisory and other fees related to the Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities. Also includes the deemed interest payable
under the FG Acquisition Agreement assuming the Acquisition Completion Date occurs on April 30, 2017. The actual amount of
transaction fees and expenses may differ from the estimated amount depending on several factors, including differences from our
estimates of fees and expenses and the actual fees and expenses as of the completion of the various transactions referred to in
the table above, as well as the actual date on which the Acquisition Completion Date occurs. To the extent either the Notes or the
Senior Term Loan is issued with original issue discount, the amount of fees and expenses will increase.

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as_
_of and for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. The following should be read in_
_conjunction with the information set forth under “Presentation of Financial and Other_
_Information,” “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information” and the_
_consolidated financial statements of Cerba HealthCare and the notes thereto._

_The following discussion includes forward-looking statements based on assumptions about our_
_future performance. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these_
_forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those_
_described under “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum._

#### Overview

We are a leading European clinical pathology laboratory, providing routine and specialized
clinical laboratory testing services primarily in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the UAE, and
supporting pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide in the clinical trial phase of
their drug development processes.

Through our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations, we offer a range of over 2,500
routine and specialty clinical tests used by doctors and medical institutions to diagnose, monitor
and treat diseases. We generally perform clinical tests using automated testing equipment,
quickly delivering results to doctors, hospitals and patients and offering specialized assistance
with respect to interpretation of results. Through a large network of high quality laboratories in
France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the UAE, our Routine Lab operations perform a wide variety
of clinical tests (including blood chemistry analyses, urinalyses, blood cell counts and
microbiology cultures and procedures) for patients who have generally been prescribed these
tests by their doctors. Our Specialized Testing operations offer private laboratories and public
hospitals a broad range of specialty testing services, such as molecular biology testing, oncology
testing, allergy testing, hormonology testing, infectious disease testing and diagnostic genetic
testing. While France represents the largest share of our Specialized Testing customer base
(91.9% of our Specialized Testing net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016), we also offer
our services to hospitals or laboratories based elsewhere in Europe, the Middle East and North
Africa. The prices of a large majority of the clinical tests that we offer in our Routine Lab and
Specialized Testing businesses are set by the respective government authorities of the countries
in which we operate.

Our Central Lab testing operations, which we operate through our BARC subsidiaries, provide
testing services to pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations worldwide in
connection with the clinical trial phrase of drug development. We leverage our Routine Lab and
Specialized Testing facilities and expertise to develop testing protocols with our clients and to
provide a range of safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamic testing services.

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,396 full-time equivalent employees and we
employed approximately 415 clinical pathologists. Over the course of our history, we have
developed our business through strategic acquisitions of regional laboratories, such as our
acquisitions of JS Bio, Cerballiance Provence, Cerballiance Hauts-de-France, Cerballiance Réunion
and Novescia, as well as through selective purchases of larger testing platforms for access to new
markets, such as our acquisitions of a majority stake in Menalabs in the United Arab Emirates in
2016, LLAM in Luxembourg in 2011 and BARC in Belgium in 2007.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated total net sales of €634.1 million. Over the
same period, our Routine Lab business generated net sales of €385.8 million (60.9% of our total
net sales), our Specialized Testing business generated net sales of €179.3 million (28.3% of our
total net sales) and our Central Lab business generated net sales of €25.0 million (3.9% of our
total net sales), each prior to elimination of intercompany sales, which accounted for negative
€26.7 million and included €0.7 million of net sales generated by our operations in the United
Arab Emirates. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of €145.5 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
of €161.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Summary—Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

#### Factors that Affect Our Results of Operations

You should consider the following factors when analyzing our financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Demand for Laboratory Tests_**
Our revenue is directly related to the volume of tests we perform. Demographic trends, including
the growing size of the elderly population, the increase in soft diseases such as allergies, and the
growth of long-term diseases such as cancer and diabetes requiring recurrent tests are
contributing to increased demand for our services. Testing volumes have also increased as the
medical profession focuses on the prevention and early detection and treatment of chronic and
severe illnesses and increasingly relies on clinical testing for more accurate diagnoses, which also
leads to the development of new tests. In addition, the greater health consciousness of the
general public along with increased disposable income contributes to both volume growth and a
willingness of certain patients to absorb out-of-pocket costs. In addition, outsourcing of specialty
tests from hospital laboratories has increased mainly due to public spending cuts in the countries
where we operate. Increase in demand for tests we provide is however mitigated by the
routinization of specialized testing by laboratories that previously outsourced tests to our
Specialized Testing business. This occurs for example when technology for certain tests progresses
and leads to the development of more cost effective tests that can be performed by routine
laboratories or when the demand for the test is such that it becomes cost efficient for routine
laboratories to perform it. We experienced this in 2012 when the testing of vitamin D levels was
insourced. Demand is also tempered by the decrease in the number of tests prescribed by doctors,
mainly in France, as they face pressure from governmental agencies to reduce prescriptions for
certain tests.

**_Regulated Tariffs for Laboratory Testing_**
We mainly operate in countries (France, Belgium and Luxembourg) and in market segments
(Routine and Specialized laboratory testing) where clinical laboratory testing services are largely
paid through publicly funded healthcare programs with regulated tariffs. Tariffs are set by
governments and healthcare authorities and we have no control over the prices we charge to our

81


-----

clients. In addition, in the countries where we operate, we are not allowed to propose additional
paid services to our professional or non-professional clients.

With 60.9% and 28.3% of our net sales (prior to elimination of intercompany sales) for the year
ended December 31, 2016 generated from our Routine Lab business in France and from our
Specialized Testing business, respectively, we consider that approximately 90% of our
consolidated net sales in 2016 were generated from regulated tariffs.

Since 2009, European governments, including the governments of France and Belgium, have
been implementing austerity measures aimed at reducing government expenditures, including in
healthcare. These measures encompass both tariff decreases and measures aimed at limiting
testing volume growth overall. In France, efforts have been underway to reduce tariffs for clinical
laboratory tests. Based on the “Rapport Charges et produits pour l’année 2017” by CNAM, the
government targets annual savings in French healthcare expenditures of approximately
€1.4 billion in the year 2017. Similar efforts to control health expenditures are also being made in
Belgium, where, in addition to regulated tariffs, the government defines each year a global
spending limit on clinical laboratory tests, which incentivizes doctors and patients to limit
volumes. In view of reducing public health expenditures, the Belgian government also reduced
fixed fees for ambulatory care (clinical biology) by approximately 9% in 2013 and an additional
4% to 5% in 2016, including for laboratory tests performed by non-hospital laboratories, such as
ours (see Royal Decree of October 18, 2013 amending the Royal Decree of 24 September 1992
laying down the procedures for fixed fee for certain clinical laboratory services provided to
ambulatory patients, as well as the outsourcing of these services and Royal Decree of
November, 9 2016 amending the Royal Decree of 24 September 1992 laying down the procedures
for fixed fee for certain clinical laboratory services provided to ambulatory patients, as well as
the outsourcing of these services). In the wake of continued economic and financial instability as
well as increased pressure on public spending in Europe, we expect further tariff decreases in the
countries where we operate, particularly France.

**_General Economic Conditions and Reimbursement Levels_**
Although the clinical laboratory services market is generally considered to be less sensitive to
economic cycles than certain other markets, we believe that a weakening of overall economic
conditions may have a negative impact on our results of operations. Although we operate in
countries where laboratory tests are largely paid for by healthcare programs, deterioration of
economic conditions have led and will likely continue to lead governments to seek to reduce
healthcare expenditure growth, which increases pressure on prices and volumes for our services.
In addition, in France, our main market, public healthcare programs financed approximately 70%
of the spending in the French private clinical pathology testing market in 2015, and customers
are directly or indirectly (such as through private health insurance premiums) responsible for the
remainder of that cost. As a result, individual decisions to reduce out-of-pocket healthcare
expenditures may result in reduced demand for our services. More broadly, a general diminution
of disposable income, or the perception thereof in times of economic downturn, can lead to a
reduction in individuals’ healthcare expenditures, regardless of the level of reimbursements by
public social security systems or private insurance.

**_Expansion of Our Laboratory Network Through Acquisitions_**
We have expanded our network of clinical laboratories, and intend to continue to expand,
through acquisitions. Historically, we have mainly focused on acquisitions of small and medium
sized regional laboratories in France to strengthen our network in the regions where we are
already present through regional clusters. While we focus on small bolt-on acquisitions, we have
also made certain larger strategic acquisitions to expand our geographic presence or enter new
segments. For example, in 2007, we expanded our geographical reach and business mix through
the acquisition of BARC in Belgium, thereby entering the central lab and Belgian routine market.
In May 2014, we completed the acquisition of JS Bio to complement our position in the south
east region of France and in March 2015, we completed the acquisition of Novescia, which
allowed us to further expand on geographical coverage in our core French market and to

82


-----

strengthen our business with private hospitals, a significant source of business for Novescia. As of
December 31, 2016, we estimate that we have realized approximately €12.6 million of synergies
from the acquisition of Novescia (compared to targeted synergies of approximately €10 million)
and we have implemented the procedures to realize the full-year effect of these synergies in
2017.

In 2016, we completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Menalabs, a network of routine
laboratories in the United Arab Emirates to expand our network to the Middle East, a region
experiencing strong growth. In the same year, we also completed the acquisition of Antagène
S.A., a veterinary laboratory in France to diversify our business portfolio, and the acquisitions of
LABM Brot, Diagnostika Holding Ltd and Biotech Medical Lab. In the years December 31, 2014,
2015 and 2016, we completed three, seven and five acquisitions, respectively, for aggregate
consideration, including earn-outs, of €75.4 million, €286.4 million and €16.3 million,
respectively.

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. First, our results for the period
during which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the
acquired business in our consolidated results. Acquisitions made since January 1, 2014
contributed on a cumulative basis 6.7%, 35.2% and 40.5% of the net sales of Cerba HealthCare
for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In addition, the results of
the acquired businesses after their acquisition may be impacted positively by synergies. For
example, the businesses we have acquired in the past, particularly the small bolt-on acquisitions,
have generally generated savings on reagent purchases and technical and administrative
expenses within a short period after their acquisition and have realized savings on personnel
expenses over a longer period of time. For larger strategic acquisitions, we may experience a
temporary increase in investments and personnel expenses as we integrate the acquired business
into our network. Finally, because acquired businesses are consolidated from the date of their
acquisition, the full impact of an acquisition is only reflected in our financial statements in the
subsequent financial year.

Because of the nature of the businesses we acquire, we carry a significant amount of goodwill on
our balance sheet (€982.3 million as of December 31, 2016). Goodwill is subject to an impairment
test annually and whenever there are indications of impairment. We may record significant
charges in our income statement in case of impairment under IFRS.

We intend to further expand our network by continuing to acquire laboratories in each of the
markets where we currently operate and selectively explore opportunities to purchase existing
laboratory networks in new markets.

**_Changes in Regulation_**
Our business is subject to, and impacted by, extensive and frequently changing laws and
regulations in each of the countries in which we operate as well as at the European Union level.
See “Regulation.” In particular, until 2010, consolidation was strictly regulated in the French
market, by limitations placed on the number of clinical laboratories that could be operated by a
single laboratory company. In addition, limitations on outsourcing and minimum levels of
staffing required at each laboratory generated operational inefficiencies in that market. Some of
these constraints have recently become less stringent: restrictions on the number of clinical
laboratories that may be owned and operated by the same laboratory company have been
softened, paving the way for market consolidation. However, outsourcing of tests between
clinical laboratories is still limited, and minimum staffing requirements remain. Consolidation has
also been affected by national labor laws that limit flexibility to reduce our workforce.

In France, the establishment and operation of clinical laboratories requires administrative
authorization from local health authorities and compliance with certain standards set by law. The
existing authorization process has been gradually replaced, since November 1, 2016, by a
procedure of mandatory accreditation (applicable in steps on November 1, 2016, November 1,

83


-----

2018 and November 1, 2020), and stricter standards (ISO: 15189) to obtain such accreditation
have been introduced. Although implementing these stricter standards will be costly and time
consuming, we believe that we are better prepared than our smaller competitors to comply with
such heightened requirements. We believe that smaller laboratory companies may be unable to
obtain the applicable accreditations and may be forced to close or to pursue mergers or
consolidate with larger groups such as ours.

For a detailed discussion of the regulatory risks that we are facing, see “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business—We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements_
_governing our activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our business_
_activities may be negatively impacted if we fail to comply” and “Regulation.”_

**_Sensitivity of Our Cost Structure_**
Our cost base is largely fixed, with only consumption of materials and supplies (consisting mainly
of reagent purchases and outsourced tests), certain external expenses and a small portion of
personnel expenses considered fully variable. Personnel expense, which represented 38.0% of the
net sales of Cerba HealthCare for the year ended December 31, 2016, is largely fixed due in part
to national labor laws limiting workforce reductions and requiring the presence of at least one
clinical pathologist in every lab. We believe that we can generally reduce personnel expenses,
within a two year period, through the creation of regional clusters by converting acquired
laboratories into collection centers and through mergers of laboratories, which allows us to
redeploy staff more efficiently and achieve savings on technical and administrative expenses. We
have already consolidated a substantial portion of our operations in Belgium and are in the
process of doing so in France, where recent regulatory changes now allow us to reduce staffing
levels and insource the performance of tests among clinical laboratories to technical platforms
operated by the same laboratory company.

**_Cyclicality of the Central Lab Business_**
Revenues derived from our Central Lab business depend on the expenditures made by our clients,
generally pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in research and development. The
economic downturn has increased the risk associated with conducting our Central Lab business as
economic difficulties result in budgetary constraints on our clients’ research and development
projects. Companies in these industries, particularly smaller biotechnology companies, are reliant
on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their research and development projects. As a
result, they may not be able to obtain access to credit or equity funding, which could affect their
ability to engage in new trial testing projects, complete existing trials in accordance with the
initial trial timetables, or make timely payments to us for projects already launched. In addition
to volume reductions, the economic climate may result in downward pressure on prices and
therefore margins. Decreases in research and development spending, or the perception thereof
in times of economic downturn, can lead to a reduction in our clients’ trial testing expenditure
and pressure for improved terms. Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect
our clients in these industries also affect our business. We believe that we benefit from some
downside protection as our Central Lab business leverages the infrastructure of our Routine and
Specialized Testing business, which share the fixed costs associated with the Central Lab business.
Nonetheless, changes in the number of research and development projects our clients conduct or
outsource, or their effort to obtain improved terms, affect revenues and profitability. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses—Our Central Lab business depends on the_
_pharmaceutical industry and creates a risk of liability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our_
_Businesses—Our Central Lab backlog may not be indicative of future results.”_

**_Seasonality_**
We experience limited seasonality in the volumes of tests we perform and, consequently, in our
net sales. We have historically performed fewer tests during holiday and vacation periods,
notably in the summer months and around the winter holidays. The extent of the impact of the
seasonality varies among the countries in which we operate and is also affected by the number of

84


-----

working days in a period. Our net working capital requirements generally follow the seasonality
of the business.

#### Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements

In the future, we will report consolidated financial statements and other information for the
Issuer and its subsidiaries prepared under IFRS. The fiscal year of the Issuer ends on December 31
of each calendar year and the first annual consolidated financial statements for the Issuer will be
available in respect of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Issuer will account for the
Acquisition using the purchase method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the
comparability of the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements with the financial statements of
Cerba HealthCare contained in this Offering Memorandum. We will apply purchase accounting
adjustments in connection with the Transactions to our financial statements for accounting
periods subsequent to the Acquisition Completion Date. The application of purchase accounting
could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance
sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and
different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments,
our financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made.

We will also incur a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the Transactions. As of
December 31, 2016, on an unaudited pro forma basis to give effect to the Transactions, we would
have had €1,081.3 million of outstanding total indebtedness, including the €180.0 million of
Notes offered hereby, the €794.0 million of borrowings under the Senior Term Loan and
€107.3 million of existing debt that will not be subject to the Refinancing. See “Summary—
_Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information.” Our indebtedness may limit our_
flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business
opportunities, since a substantial portion our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the
repayment of our indebtedness, and this may place us at a competitive disadvantage as some of
our competitors are less leveraged.

#### Key Income Statement Items

Below is a summary description of the key elements of the IFRS line items of the income
statements for Cerba HealthCare.

**_Net sales corresponds to sales of our testing services provided directly to patients, outsourced to_**
us by hospitals and other private laboratories, or provided to the pharmaceutical industry in
connection with our clinical trial activities. Net sales consists of revenue from services rendered in
the course of ordinary activities, measures the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual volume discounts for hospitals.
Revenue related to analyses/tests carried out in connection with routine and specialized clinical
testing is recognized when the report is validated by the clinical pathologist (which is the date
results are communicated to the client). For our Central Lab business, clinical trials are governed
by contractual arrangements and revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion
method, measured on the basis of work performed.

**_Cost of sales/Consumption of materials and supplies primarily includes our costs for the reagents_**
we purchase from suppliers and for tests we outsource to other clinical laboratories.

**_Other purchases and external expenses includes mainly third party transport expenses,_**
consumables, utilities, laboratory leases, operating leases, maintenance costs, post and
telecommunication expenses, fees to external service providers, including audit, accounting,
legal, human resources and marketing fees, insurance, security, cleaning, vehicle rental and travel
expenses.

**_Personnel expenses principally include wages and salaries, compulsory social security_**
contributions, post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits and employee profit

85


-----

sharing. Personnel expenses also include costs associated with the use of subcontractors and
non-salaried personnel.

**_Net change in depreciation, amortization and impairment includes regular depreciation and_**
amortization of non-current assets such as intangible assets, buildings, laboratory equipment,
computers and software. When applicable, it also includes impairment of goodwill. It also
includes provisions for operational risks, disputes, pensions, bad debt and overdue receivables.

**_Other operating income and expenses principally includes miscellaneous income and expenses_**
not related to the operation of our clinical laboratories.

**_Net financial income (expense) is financial income, net of financial expense. Financial expense_**
primarily includes interest and related expense, such as interest on bank loans, interest on bonds
issued to shareholders, commitment fees, swap related finance costs and accrued interest and
related expenses.

**_Income tax includes corporate tax paid on income (in France, “impôt sur les bénéfices”) and_**
deferred taxes; it does not include other taxes payable by us, which are recorded under the line
item “Taxes and duties” in our IFRS income statement.

_Net Sales_
Our total net sales increased by €78.1 million, or 14.0%, from €556.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to €634.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was
primarily due to the full year effect of the net sales generated by the businesses acquired in 2015
(mainly Novescia, contributing from March 1, 2015) for a total of €60.6 million, as well as the net
sales generated by the businesses acquired in 2016 for a total of €1.6 million. Excluding the
impact of these acquisitions, net sales on a like-for-like basis increased by €15.9 million or 3.8%
between the year ended December 31, 2015, and the year ended December 31, 2016.

This organic growth was primarily due to an increase in net sales of our Specialized Testing
business of €24.9 million, or 16.1%, between the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year
ended December 31, 2016, due to gains of market shares and new revenue streams from
innovative tests or services, such as non-invasive prenatal assessment of trisomy 21 or colorectal
cancer screening. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales of our Specialized Testing
business on a like-for-like basis increased by 15.9% between the year ended December 31, 2015,
and the year ended December 31, 2016.

Net sales from our Central Lab business decreased by €7.5 million, or 22.9%, between the year
ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a lower
number of new contracts signed with customers between January 1, 2014, and September 30,
2015. Acquisitions did not impact net sales from our Central Lab business between the year
ended December 31, 2015, and the year ended December 31, 2016.

Net sales from our Routine Lab business in France increased by €67.7 million, or 21.3%, between
the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the
full year effect of the net sales generated by the Routine Lab business acquired in 2015 (mainly
Novescia, contributing from March 1, 2015), amounting to €60.6 million, as well as the net sales
generated by the businesses acquired in 2016 for a total of €0.5 million. Excluding the impact of
these acquisitions, net sales from our Routine Lab business in France on a like-for-like basis
increased by €6.6 million, or 3.7%, between the year ended December 31, 2015, and the year
ended December 31, 2016. Net sales from our Routine Lab business in Belgium and Luxembourg
increased by €0.5 million, or 0.7%, between the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year
ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a stabilization of revenue streams in this business
unit after a decrease in net sales of 5.6% in 2015. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales
of our Routine Lab business on a like-for-like basis increased by 2.9% between the year ended
December 31, 2015, and the year ended December 31, 2016.

The balance is explained by the movement in intercompany sales, mostly between Routine Lab in
France and Specialized Testing in France.

_Consumption of Materials and Supplies_
Consumption of materials and supplies increased by €7.6 million, or 8.7%, from €87.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2015 to €94.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This
increase was primarily due to the full year effect of the cost of sales incurred by the businesses
acquired in 2015.

Gross margin increased from 84.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, to 85.1% for the year
ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the implementation of our tariffs to
acquired businesses and improvement in our purchasing conditions and testing processes due to
our increased scale.

_Other Purchases and External Expenses_
Other purchases and external expenses increased by €9.4 million, or 7.0%, from €134.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2015 to €143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
This increase was primarily due to the full-year impact of operating expenses incurred by the
businesses acquired in 2015.

87


-----

Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 24.2% for the
year ended December 31, 2015, to 22.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease
was primarily due to a strict monitoring of costs and our ability to realize synergies and gain
greater operating leverage through increased scale.

_Personnel Expenses_
Personnel expenses increased by €26.4 million, or 12.3%, from €214.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €240.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was
primarily due to the full-year impact of the personnel expenses incurred by the Routine Lab
businesses acquired in 2015.

Personnel expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 38.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to 38.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily
due to our strict monitoring of staff costs and our ability to integrate acquired companies, to
realize synergies and gain greater operating leverage through our increased scale.

As of December 31, 2016, we had 4,396 full-time equivalent employees compared to 4,285 as of
December 31, 2015.

_Net Change in Depreciation and Amortization_
Net change in depreciation and amortization increased by €5.5 million, or 16.7%, from
€32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to €38.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the full year effect of the depreciation and
amortization incurred by the businesses acquired in 2015.

_Financial Income / (Expense)_
Financial expense (net of financial income) increased by €26.1 million, or 44.6%, from
€58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to €84.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a contemplated refinancing, which
resulted in a €13.0 million charge in respect of a provision for redemption fees on the Existing
Notes (with a cash impact to occur in 2017) and a €9.2 million charge in respect of the
accelerated amortization of existing refinanced debt issuance costs (with no cash impact). The
remaining €4.0 million increase was due to the full year effect of the €85.0 million of additional
Existing Senior Secured Notes and €145.0 million of Existing Senior Notes issued in February 2015
and, to a lesser extent, €40.0 million of additional Existing Senior Secured Notes issued in October
2016.

_Income Tax_
Income tax expense increased by €7.1 million from an expense of €8.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015 to an expense of €16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This
increase primarily reflects an unusually low amount of income tax in 2015, which resulted from
M&A transactions and financing costs in 2015 recognized in connection with the acquisition of
Novescia.

_Net Sales_
Our total net sales increased by €156.8 million, or 39.3%, from €399.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to €556.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was
primarily due to the full year effect of the net sales generated by the businesses acquired in 2014
(mainly JS Bio, contributing from June 1, 2014) and acquisitions in 2015 (mainly Novescia,
contributing from March 1, 2015) for a total of €169.1 million. Excluding the impact of these
acquisitions, net sales on a like-for-like basis decreased by €12.4 million, or 3.3%, between the
year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a tariff reduction
in Luxembourg and a decrease in net sales generated by our Central Lab operations, primarily
due to a lower number of new contracts signed between January 1, 2014, and September 30,
2015.

Net sales generated by our Specialized Testing business increased by €14.9 million, or 10.7%,
between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015. This
increase was primarily due to gains in market shares and new revenue streams from innovative
tests or services, such as non-invasive prenatal assessment of trisomy 21 or colorectal cancer
screening. Acquisitions did not impact net sales from our Specialized Testing business between
the year ended December 31, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net sales from our Central Lab business decreased by €12.2 million, or 27.3%, between the year
ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a lower
number of new contracts signed between January 1, 2014, and September 30, 2015. Acquisitions

-----

did not impact net sales from our Central Lab business between the year ended December 31,
2014, and the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net sales from our Routine Lab business in France increased by €162.5 million, or 104.4%,
between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily
due to the full year effect of the net sales generated by the businesses acquired in 2014 (mainly
JS Bio, contributing from June 1, 2014), amounting to €21.7 million, as well as the net sales
generated by the businesses acquired in 2015, including Novescia, contributing from March 1,
2015, which alone accounted for €127.1 million. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, net
sales from our Routine Lab business in France on a like-for-like basis decreased by €0.5 million, or
0.4%, between the year ended December 31, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net sales of our Routine Lab business in Belgium and Luxembourg decreased by €3.9 million, or
5.3%, between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015,
primarily due to a 20% tariff reduction in Luxembourg implemented in January 2015.
Additionally, sales were impacted by organizational issues caused by the implementation of a
new enterprise resource planning system and disturbances in management activity caused by the
departures of certain key clinical pathologists and key managers. Excluding the impact of
acquisitions, net sales of our Routine Lab business on a like-for-like basis decreased by 5.2%
between the year ended December 31, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2015.

The balance is explained by the movement in intercompany sales, mostly between Routine Lab in
France and Specialized Testing in France.

_Consumption of Materials and Supplies_
Consumption of materials and supplies increased by €20.7 million, or 31.2%, from €66.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2014, to €87.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
This increase was primarily due to the full year effect of the cost of sales incurred by businesses
acquired in 2014 and 2015.

Gross margin increased from 83.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, to 84.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the implementation of our tariffs to
acquired businesses and the improvement in our purchasing conditions and testing processes due
to our increased scale.

_Other Purchases and External Expenses_
Other purchases and external expenses increased by €40.3 million, or 42.9%, from €94.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2014, to €134.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
This increase was primarily due to the full-year impact of the other operating expenses incurred
by the businesses acquired in 2014 and 2015.

Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from 23.5% for the
year ended December 31, 2014, to 24.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to
the impact of recent acquisitions, mainly Novescia, with a historically higher ratio of other
purchases and external expenses to net sales.

_Personnel Expenses_
Personnel expenses increased by €73.8 million, or 52.5%, from €140.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to €214.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was
primarily due to the full year impact of the personnel expenses incurred by the businesses
acquired in 2014 and 2015, such as Novescia.

Personnel expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from 35.2% for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to 38.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting recent
acquisitions in our Routine Lab business in France, which are typically labor-intensive and had not
yet delivered all their potential cost savings and efficiencies by the end of 2015, and the
reinforcement of our headquarters support functions (such as process and engineering, IT or
financial control) to improve the integration of acquired laboratories and implementation of
synergies.

90


-----

As of December 31, 2015, we had 4,285 full-time equivalent employees compared to 2,669 as of
December 31, 2014.

_Net Change in Depreciation and Amortization_
Net change in depreciation and amortization increased by €8.9 million, or 37.1%, from
€24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to €32.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

_Goodwill Impairment_
A goodwill impairment charge of €22.6 million was recorded for the year ended December 31,
2014, due to short-term uncertainties in connection with our Central Lab business, such as lower
new contracts, decreasing backlog and mergers of competitors. We did not identify indicators of
impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2015.

_Financial Income / (Expense)_
Financial expense (net of financial income) increased by €20.0 million, or 51.9%, from an expense
of €38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to an expense of €58.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to two issuances of Existing Notes
in 2015 (i.e, €85 million of additional Existing Senior Secured Notes in February 2015 and
€145 million of Existing Senior Notes in February 2015), and the full-year effect of a single
issuance of €80 million of additional Existing Senior Secured Notes in April 2014.

_Income Tax_
Income tax decreased by €1.9 million, or 17.6%, from €10.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to €8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which resulted from
M&A transactions and financing costs in 2015 recognized in connection with the acquisition of
Novescia.

#### Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash
requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service
obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as
acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by our cash from operating activities
and our financings. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily to fund acquisitions, to meet our
debt services obligations, working capital and, to a lesser extent, to fund capital expenditures.

Our financial condition and liquidity is and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors,
including:

- our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

- the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, and the
interest we are obligated to pay on such indebtedness, which affects our net financial expense;

- our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to continue to borrow funds from financial
institutions; and

- our external growth funding requirements, which consist primarily of the funding of
acquisitions of additional laboratories.

Our cash requirements consist mainly of the following:

- funding acquisitions;

- funding working capital requirements;

91


-----

- funding capital expenditures needs;

- servicing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries;

- operating activities; and

- paying taxes.

Our sources of liquidity will consist mainly of the following:

- cash generated from our operating activities;

- borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility which we expect will be undrawn on the
Acquisition Completion Date;

- borrowings under debt securities;

- borrowings under bilateral loan facilities; and

- capital contributions from our shareholders.

**_Consolidated Cash Flow Statement_**
The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flow statement for the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, based on our audited financial statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Cash Flow from / (used in) Operating Activities_
Cash flow from operating activities increased by €21.0 million from a cash inflow of €88.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2015, to a cash inflow of €109.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in EBITDA by €30.0 million,
partially offset by a €17.1 million decrease in change in working capital due to an increase in
accounts receivable in connection with our higher net sales in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease
in change in working capital was partially offset by improved payment terms over the period.

Cash flow from operating activities increased by €20.7 million from a cash inflow of €67.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2014, to a cash inflow of €88.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase of €19.2 million in EBITDA,
together with a €10.3 million increase in change in working capital due to improvement in our
cash generation through quicker reimbursement following a better monitoring of accounts
receivable collection.

_Cash Flow from / (used in) Investing Activities_
Cash flow used in investing activities decreased by €269.7 million from a cash outflow of
€309.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to a cash outflow of €39.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investments in
acquisitions, from €286.4 million in 2015 (mainly Novescia) to €16.3 million in 2016. Investments

92


-----

in acquisitions in 2016 are partly due to acquisitions completed in 2015 for which acquisition
prices were not entirely paid out at year-end. Only €8.9 million relate to the following
acquisitions completed in 2016: Antagène S.A., LABM Brot, Menalabs, Diagnostika Holding Ltd
and Biotech Medical Lab. Our operating capital expenditures, excluding investments in
acquisitions, amounted €22.8 million in 2016, or 3.6% of our net sales, consisting primarily of
investments in diagnostics and IT equipment to upgrade our technical platforms.

Cash flow used in investing activities increased by €225.7 million from a cash outflow of
€83.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to a cash outflow of €309.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in investments in
acquisitions from €75.4 million in 2014 to €286.4 million in 2015 due to the acquisition of
Novescia. Our operating capital expenditures, excluding investments in acquisitions, amounted to
€9.5 million in 2014 and €23.0 million in 2015 or 4.1% of our net sales, of which €9.0 million (or
1.6% of revenue) relate to the Belval project in Luxembourg, consisting of a new building and a
fully automated laboratory.

_Cash Flow from / (used in) Financing Activities_
Cash flow from financing activities decreased by €270.3 million from a cash inflow of
€203.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to a cash outflow of €66.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the issuance of €85.0 million
additional Existing Senior Secured Notes and €145.0 million Existing Senior Notes issued in
February 2015 for the acquisition of Novescia. Cash flow used in financing activities in 2016
consisted of net interest expense of €56.7 million, of which €49.4 million relate to the Existing
Senior Secured Notes, including the additional Existing Senior Secured Notes issued in 2015, and
the repayment of financial liabilities of €85.2 million, including €50.0 million under our Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, partly offset by new borrowings for €76.6 million, including
€40.0 million of Existing Senior Secured Notes issued in December 2016.

Cash flow from financing activities increased by €188.8 million from a cash inflow of
€14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to a cash inflow of €203.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2015. Cash from financing activities in 2015 consisted of new
borrowings for €281.3 million, including the €230.0 million additional Existing Notes issued in
February 2015 for the acquisition of Novescia together with €50.0 million drawn under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility to partly finance other bolt-on acquisitions, which was partially
offset by net interest expense of €45.9 million, of which €40.4 million relate to the Existing
Notes, and the repayment of financial liabilities of €32.5 million.

**_Capital Expenditures_**
Our net capital expenditures, excluding asset acquisitions, for the years ended December 31,
2014, 2015 and 2016 were €9.5 million, €23.0 million and €22.8 million, respectively. These reflect
primarily capital expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of our business.

We expect our capital expenditures, excluding asset acquisitions, to be approximately
€30.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, mostly related to investments in diagnostics
and IT equipment to upgrade our technical platforms.

#### Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2016, our pro forma net financial debt excluding shareholder debt, as
adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the application of proceeds from the
Offering and drawings under the Senior Credit Facilities, would have been €1,051.3 million,
which reflects external interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

We expect cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility
to be our principal sources of funds. Future drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will be
available only if, among other things, we comply with the financial and other covenants in the
Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to meet the financial covenant in the Revolving Credit

outside our control. For more information about the Revolving Credit Facility, see “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

Our new Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not be drawn on the Acquisition Completion
Date.

#### Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

We are a party to various customary off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees and
security granted in connection with earn out obligations when businesses are acquired. See note
6.29 to our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

#### Financial Risk Management

We have historically been exposed to limited foreign exchange risk, as in the past we have entered
into limited foreign currency transactions. However, our international acquisitions, for example the
acquisition of a majority stake in Menalabs in 2016, expose us to exchange rate fluctuations.

We have historically been exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates, and
our exposure is expected to increase following the Transactions, as our €794.0 million Senior
Term Loan will be floating rate. Although we are not required to enter into hedging transactions
or to use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate
fluctuations pursuant to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, we have, and may from time to
time, enter into hedging transactions and use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the
adverse effects of this risk.

We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We do not apply
hedge accounting under IFRS.

#### Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

IFRS require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the relevant period. These estimates and assumptions are based on the
information available at the time of preparation of the financial statements and affect the
published amounts. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**_IFRS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates_**
We consider the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the
assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements in accordance

94


-----

with IFRS and the uncertainties that could affect our financial results, financial condition and
cash flows:

- consolidation methods;

- recognition of revenue associated with clinical laboratory testing operations and clinical trials;

- accounting for deferred and income taxes;

- accounting for provisions and for impairment of financial assets;

- accounting for and impairment of goodwill;

- accounting for derivative financial instruments; and

- accounting for employee benefits.

A more detailed description of the accounting rules and methods that we apply under IFRS is
provided in note 6.4 to the audited consolidated financial statements of Cerba HealthCare as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2016 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Consolidation Methods_
All significant investments in affiliates that are exclusively controlled by Cerba HealthCare, either
directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated.

French legislation requires that for laboratories that are incorporated as SELs, the clinical
pathologists operating such SELs hold a majority of the shares and voting rights of such entities.
In strict compliance with these regulatory constraints, the Group has set up a capital structure
that meets these obligations while the bylaws governing such entities allow us to hold a majority
of the financial rights in such subsidiaries. Further, provisions of the bylaws and shareholder
agreements that we have entered into with the clinical pathologists holding majority voting
power give us negative control over key matters of corporate governance, including the
incurrence of indebtedness, acquisitions and dispositions.

Although the Group does not hold the majority of voting rights in its SEL subsidiaries, the above
mentioned mechanisms allow it to obtain the majority of the economic benefits and also to
demonstrate the existence of control, while being in full compliance with French legislation,
therefore enabling the French entities to be fully consolidated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that
control ceases.

_Revenue_
Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value
of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual
volume discounts for hospitals.

Our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations are carried out in clinical laboratories.
Revenue related to the analyses/tests carried out is recognized when the test report is validated
by the clinical pathologist (i.e., the date on which results are given to the client).

For our Central Lab business, clinical trials are governed by contractual agreements providing for
specific invoicing at each stage. Revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion
method. Percentage of completion is measured on the basis of work performed.

_Income Tax_
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in
profit or loss unless they relate to a business combination, or to items that are recognized directly
in equity or in other comprehensive income.

95


-----

Current tax is (i) the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable profit or tax loss for the
period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and (ii) any
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for tax purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is
not a business combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit;

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent
that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary
differences when they are reversed, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
reporting date.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, we take into account the impact of
uncertain tax positions and any additional taxes and interest that may be due.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax assets and liabilities and they relate to taxes levied by the same authority, either on the same
taxable entity or on different tax entities that intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on
a net basis, and realize their tax assets and settle their tax liabilities simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax credits, tax losses and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that taxable profit will be realized.

The French Finance Act of 2010 eliminated the business tax (taxe professionnelle) as of 2010 and
replaced it with two new taxes: the property business tax (cotisation foncière des entreprises, or
the “CFE”) and the value added business tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises, or
the “CVAE”). In accordance with the opinion of the Conseil National de la Comptabilité, the body
that sets French national accounting standards, dated January 14, 2010, the Group has concluded
that the CVAE falls within the scope of International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 12 and it has
therefore been recognized under income tax. A deferred tax liability related to the CVAE is
recognized.

_Provisions_
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of
the discount is recognized under finance costs.

_Restructuring._ A provision for restructuring is recognized when the Group has approved a
detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring (i) either has commenced (ii) or has
been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provisioned.

_Financial assets measured at amortized cost._ We consider evidence of impairment for financial
assets measured at amortized cost (loans and receivables) at both a specific asset and collective
level.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices we issue require specific credit management
processes. Impairment policies for receivables have been implemented on the basis of historical

96


-----

trends. However, impairment allowances are allocated specifically. In specialized clinical
pathology laboratories, the collection of receivables from direct patients, which are more than 35
days overdue, is handled by a debt collection company.

In assessing collective impairment, we use historical trends of the probability of default, the
timing of collection and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted based on management’s judgment
as to whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to
be greater or less than those suggested by historical trends.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the
difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Losses are recognized in profit or loss under “Net change in depreciation and amortization” and
are recorded in an allowance account for loans and receivables. When an event occurring after
the impairment was recognized causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease
in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

_Goodwill_
_Initial recognition._ Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the
acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.

We measure goodwill at the acquisition date as:

- the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus

- the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, plus

- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity
interest in the acquiree, less

- the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed.

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the
Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the
contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not re measured and settlement is
accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent
consideration are recognized in profit or loss.

Commercial goodwill that is acquired by the Group is accounted for as a business combination.

_Subsequent measurement._ Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For
the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units (“CGUs”)
or group(s) of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business
combination.

The CGUs or group of CGUs identified by the Group are as follows:

- the specialized clinical pathology CGU, corresponding to our Specialized Testing business;

- the France private clinical laboratory testing CGU and the Belux private clinical laboratory
testing CGU, corresponding to our Routine Lab business; and

- the clinical trial CGU, corresponding to our Central Lab business.

To determine the value in use of each CGU, cash flows are discounted based on the weighted
average cost of capital (WACC), calculated on the basis of expected return and market risk for
each CGU.

97


-----

The final value is calculated using ad infinitum order to pay the discounted cash flow,
determined on the basis of a normalized flow and an ad infinitum growth rate. This growth rate
is in accordance with the markets development potential as regards the business as well as its
competitive position. The discounted cash flows are compared to the sum of the goodwill value
as well as to the operating assets allocated to the CGUs (intangible assets, items of property,
plant and equipment and components of working capital, net of deferred tax liabilities).

Commercial goodwill acquired during the period is recognized as part of goodwill.

_Derivative Financial Instruments_
The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. The
derivative financial instruments held are interest rate swaps. The derivative financial instruments
are not designated as hedging instruments in a hedging relationship as set out in International
Accounting Standard 39. Consequently, changes in their fair value are directly recognized in
profit or loss.

_Employee Benefits_
In accordance with the laws and practices of the countries in which it operates, the Group grants
its employees post-employment benefits (pension plans) and other long-term benefits (long
service bonuses).

_Defined benefit plans._ The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is
calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees
have vested in return for their service in the current and prior periods. This benefit is discounted
to determine its present value. Any unrecognized past service costs and the fair value of plan
assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds
that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.

The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit
method. The Group recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in
other comprehensive income.

_Other long-term employee benefits._ The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term
employee benefits other than pension plans is the amount of future benefits vested by
employees in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The benefits mainly
comprise seniority bonuses.

_connection with the sale process resulting in the Acquisition, we have not independently verified it._

#### Overview

We are engaged in three principal lines of business within the broader industry of clinical
laboratory testing services. We conduct clinical pathology testing through our Routine Lab
business and our Specialized Testing business. Our Routine Lab business provides local,
low-complexity diagnostic testing services to patients and physicians. Our Specialized Testing
business activities include providing highly complex clinical pathology, pathology and cytogenetic
testing services outsourced primarily from private and public hospitals and laboratories.
Additionally, our Central Lab business is engaged in providing testing services to pharmaceutical
companies and contract research organizations globally in connection with the clinical trial phase
of drug development. Each of our businesses focuses on different geographical regions, is
targeted at a different customer base and is consequently subject to different competitive
environments and market trends.

#### Clinical Pathology Testing

Clinical pathology testing is broadly split between routine laboratory testing, which we conduct
through our Routine Lab business, and specialized laboratory testing, which we conduct through
our Specialized Testing business.

Routine laboratory testing provides diagnostic, low-complexity testing to patients who are
prescribed a particular test by their physician or on behalf of public and private hospitals that do
not have in-house laboratories. Such diagnostic tests include clinical laboratory testing, or testing
based on the analysis of bodily fluids, such as blood tests and urinalysis. Patients are either
prescribed a test as part of a visit to their regular doctor or are required to undergo a diagnostic
test when admitted to a hospital, in connection with the diagnosis, evaluation, detection,
monitoring and treatment of medical conditions such as cancer, infectious diseases, endocrine
disorders, cardiac disorders and genetic diseases. Laboratories such as ours receive business either
directly from patients referred by their physician or patients who choose to have their tests
performed by a particular laboratory.

Specialized laboratory testing focuses on complex, relatively uncommon laboratory testing needs
that local smaller laboratories and hospitals are unable or unwilling to meet due to the expertise
and technical equipment required. The types of tests that fall under this category include:

- clinical pathology, such as molecular and cellular-level testing, virology, immunological
analyses, bacteriological testing, and other tests related to hormonology and oncology;

- anatomical pathology, which is the testing of histologic or cytological samples (such as human
tissue); and

- cytogenetic testing, such as prenatal testing for hereditary disorders.

**_Market Overview_**

We operate our Routine Lab business in various parts of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) through our recent acquisition of a majority stake in Menalabs.
Providers of routine laboratory testing services in these countries include public laboratories
associated with large public research facilities (such as regional hospitals and university hospitals
in France), small local laboratories run by clinical pathologists themselves and private clinical
laboratory networks like us.

Customers in the specialized laboratory testing market differ from those of the routine
laboratory testing market. Specialized laboratories mostly receive samples through outsourcing
referrals from other private laboratories and public or private hospitals that do not have the
facilities, equipment, certifications, expertise or volume levels necessary to perform the requested
tests. Laboratories engaged in specialized testing typically centralize their testing functions in
one location, transporting samples to be tested to their main testing facility. All of our
specialized testing is performed at our centralized facility in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France. Due
to the low volume and high geographical dispersion of specialized samples origination,
sophisticated logistics systems are required to transport samples from collection centers all over
the world to our centralized testing center. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 92% of our
Specialized Testing net sales was derived from specialized tests performed on samples collected
in France (either through our routine laboratories or from tests outsourced to us by hospitals and
other private laboratories), with the remainder derived from specialized tests performed on
samples collected by clients we work with in the rest of Europe and Middle East and Africa
respectively.

The laboratory testing market is marked by notably high barriers to entry. Establishing a
laboratory requires significant investments in specific equipment and the maintenance of a staff
of trained professionals with a high level of scientific expertise and technological know-how. In
order to sustain the profitability of its business, a laboratory must also be able to achieve
economies of scale in order to manage logistics efficiently and cost-effectively. Moreover, it is key
to have a deep knowledge of the complex legal environment in order to operate in the current
market conditions, as well as a positive working relationship with the different regulatory
bodies. Restriction on the allocation of new licenses and strict requirements in the application
process imply a long and costly process which is uneconomical for small-scale market entrants.
Finally, much like the routine laboratory testing business, the majority of prices for specialized
laboratory testing are fixed by health regulatory authorities in the local jurisdiction. As a result of
these requirements, many laboratories engaged in routine testing are unable to enter into the
specialized testing business. Likewise, we believe that it would be challenging for foreign
competitors with specialized testing capabilities to establish the necessary and accredited logistics
footprint, comply with the regulatory requirements and obtain the required referrals to develop
a sustainable competitive position in our core French market.

_France_

In 2015, according to “Comptes nationaux de la santé 2015” published by DREES, the private
market for clinical laboratory testing in France represented revenue of approximately
€4.3 billion, making it one of the largest private markets in Europe. According to an industry
report prepared by a major third party consulting firm, this equates to approximately 2% of total
French healthcare spending, with routine testing accounting for approximately €4 billion and
specialized testing accounting for the rest. Moreover, according to an industry report prepared
by a major third party consulting firm, the value of the French private clinical laboratory testing
market is estimated to have experienced approximately 2.5% compound annual growth from
2006 to 2011, reflecting the net effect of tariff decreases and a combined growth effect of
volume and mix. From 2011 to 2014 the market experienced a 0.6% average decrease in value as
a consequence of new test coefficient reductions. From 2014 onwards, the market has stabilized
due to a three-year agreement capping the growth of overall testing spending at 0.25% per year

100


-----

from 2014 to 2016, by offsetting middle single digit growth in volumes with reductions of the
pricing of certain high-volume tests. This overall spending increase permitted by the three-year
agreement was offset by limitations on the prescription of some major tests (e.g. Vitamin D) in
2014 and external factors such as several doctors strikes and terrorist attacks in 2015. The 20142016 three-year agreement has been renegotiated for the 2017-2019 period, with a similar logic
of capping the overall growth at 0.25% per year with some minor adjustments. The new
agreement includes an allocation of €60 million of additional spend in recognition of higher than
expected economies during 2014 and 2015, and to compensate for the temporary across-theboard reduction of tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was revised in January 2017.

In France, doctors prescribe clinical laboratory tests and patients are free to choose the clinical
laboratory in which they are tested. Patients typically choose a laboratory based on proximity to
their home or workplace. Accordingly, choice of a high traffic location and reputation for quality
of services are key factors. The laboratory completes the testing process in-house except for
specialized tests which can be outsourced to specialized laboratories.

Tariffs for laboratory tests are set by the Ministry of Health (Ministère des Affaires Sociales et de
_la Santé) and the National Health Insurance Fund (Caisse Nationale d’Assurance Maladie)._

In 2015, approximately 70% of spending in the French medical laboratory testing market,
including both routine and specialized testing, was financed by the French social security system
and the remainder was covered by private insurance companies (approximately 25%) and by the
patient directly out of pocket (approximately 3%). This split has not materially changed in recent
years. The French social security system updates its catalog of tests (BIOLAM) on an annual basis,
and determines the amount of reimbursement, if any, for each clinical test.

The clinical pathology testing market remains fragmented in France, with approximately 2,195
legal entities or approximately 3,876 collection centers as of December 2014. This fragmentation
is the historical result of legal requirements that limited outsourcing, restricted laboratory
ownership, capped the number of branches of a single laboratory and set constraints on how
much of a specific area’s testing needs any one laboratory could cover. The top eight leading
networks of laboratories in France (including Cerba) account for approximately 60% of the total
routine market, with the rest of the market being fragmented. Moreover, we believe
approximately 80% of the specialty testing market is controlled by the two main participants:
Cerba and Biomnis (Eurofins). As of December 2015, we believe we had a market share of
approximately 10% of the French routine testing market and approximately 40% of the specialty
testing market.

_Belgium_

According to an industry report prepared by a major third party consulting firm, the Belgian
regulated clinical biology laboratory testing market grew at a compound annual rate of
approximately 1.0% between 2012 and 2015 and generated revenue of approximately
€1.3 billion in 2015, of which approximately 75% is reimbursed by the Belgian social security
system. Furthermore, approximately €0.4 billion of the €1.3 billion are generated by private
laboratories, equating to approximately 1% of total Belgian healthcare spending.

The laboratory services market in Belgium is split between tests performed for patients that are
in the hospital, which is referred to as hospitalized care, and tests performed for patients that are
not hospitalized, which is referred to as ambulatory care, our addressable market. The
ambulatory care segment represented in 2015 approximately 60% of the total clinical pathology
market. Approximately 50% of all the tests performed for ambulatory care are performed by
private laboratories such as ours, the other 50% being performed by intra-hospital laboratories.
Ambulatory care is mainly structured on the basis of a business-to-business model where samples
are collected at a doctor’s practice before being delivered to clinical laboratories such as ours for
testing. However, certain laboratories, including ours, also maintain collection centers for direct
access to patients.

101


-----

Reimbursement levels for tests included in the INAMI (Institut National d’Assurance Maladie_Invalidité) catalog are set by the Belgium health authorities. In certain cases, laboratories are_
allowed to bill a small supplemental administrative fee per patient in addition to the set price for
a test. Laboratory tests that are prescribed for non-therapeutic reasons may be excluded from
INAMI’s price regulation and are set freely by individual laboratories. Approximately 75% of the
total biology expenses are reimbursed by INAMI, the rest being co-payment or supplements paid
directly by the patient.

The Belgian clinical biology market has undergone considerable consolidation in the past
20 years. The consolidation process has been primarily driven by the easing of ownership
restrictions to allow for the ownership of clinical laboratories by investors who are not clinical
pathologists, the increasing difficulty in obtaining authorizations to operate and tariff reductions
(in particular since the national consultation on supplements in medicine, which led to a
limitation of supplements charged by all laboratories to their patients to €9 on average).

_Luxembourg_
The Luxembourg market is split between public and private laboratories. Public laboratories
(including laboratories that are part of hospitals and clinics, as well as institutions such as the
National Health Laboratory) provide routine laboratory testing to hospitalized and ambulatory
patients accounting for approximately 25% of the ambulatory biology market, whereas private
laboratories serve ambulatory patients exclusively with approximately 75% of the ambulatory
biology market, according to an industry report prepared by a major third party consulting firm.
In 2015, the total ambulatory clinical laboratory services market in Luxembourg generated
revenue of approximately €66.7 million (or 2% of total Luxembourg healthcare spending), of
which approximately €50.0 million was attributable to private laboratories. The value of the
ambulatory biology market in Luxembourg grew at a compound annual rate of approximately
10.2% from 2010 to 2015.

Prices for all laboratory tests are set by the Luxembourg Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé)
and the national insurance scheme (Caisse Nationale de Santé). The state reimburses partial or
the full amount of test expenses at the fee level set in the annual catalog released by
government health authorities.

As of 2015, there were three private laboratories operating in Luxembourg with Cerba being the
main participant with approximately 45% of market share.

_United Arab Emirates_

According to an industry report prepared by a major third party consulting firm, the UAE
pathology diagnostics market generated revenue of approximately €512 million in 2015
(representing approximately 6% of the overall healthcare spending in the region), approximately
one third of which was generated by independent laboratories. The rest of the independent
diagnostic market is formed by public and private hospitals and clinics with testing facilities.
Routine testing accounted for 70% of the total market value while semi-specialized and
specialized test accounted for 11% and 19% respectively. The market grew at an 11% average
rate from 2010 to 2015 driven by overall development of the UAE market, which has benefited
from both public and private investments and support.

The UAE healthcare industry is comprised of various federal and local bodies across major
emirates regulating the local health sector. Prices have declined by approximately 50% since 2011
driven by increasing demand coupled with rapid development of outsourcing capacity thereby
increasing pressure to consolidate.

In 2015 the private testing market, which size could be approximated by the independent
laboratory sub-market, accounted for approximately €165 million, had five main participants

102


-----

accounting for approximately 60% of the total independent laboratory sub-market share with
some of them having partnering agreements in place with large global players. In December
2015, we believe that Menalabs had a market share of approximately 2% of the independent
laboratory sub-market in the independent diagnostic market.

**_Competition_**

_Routine Lab_

The routine laboratory testing market in the countries in which we operate has limited
competitive dynamics because of its fragmented nature and patients’ tendency to go to the
nearest laboratory to their home or workplace. As such, the competitive dynamics among the
larger industry participants revolve around the regional density of their network. In the long
term, however, we believe that the rising pressures on governments to reduce healthcare
spending as they face budget constraints are likely to lead to greater harmonization across the
European market and further liberalization of regulatory requirements, which in turn will lead to
increased competition. We believe that this could lead to cross-border consolidation among
market participants and increased penetration of the European market by some of the major
non-European laboratory groups such as Quest Diagnostics, Laboratory Corporation of America
and Sonic Healthcare.

Due to the regulated fee structure of the routine laboratory testing markets in which we
operate, we mostly compete on the basis of the quality of the services we provide and the
density of our network. We believe that patients who (as in France) are free to choose the clinical
laboratories where they are tested usually base their choice on a laboratory’s proximity to their
home or workplace. Medical doctors sometimes refer patients to specific laboratories regardless
of location. We believe that referring doctors and facilities that outsource their testing consider
the following factors, among others, in selecting a clinical laboratory:

- medical and scientific expertise;

- the accuracy, timeliness and consistency in reporting test results;

- the reputation of the clinical laboratory in the medical community or field of specialty;

- the service capability and convenience;

- the number and type of tests performed;

- the method and speed of delivering/publishing results; and

- the tools for interpreting results offered.

The competitive landscape for the routine laboratory testing market that we face varies from
market to market. In each of the countries in which we operate, however, we compete with local
and regional independent laboratories.

In France, in addition to regional market participants, we also face competition from nationwide
groups such as Synlab or Unilabs. We believe that we are the largest providers in the French
Routine Lab market in terms of 2016 run-rate revenues achieved through our local leadership
within regional clusters. Through our recent acquisitions, we have grown our market share
allowing us to secure a leading position in the industry.

In Belgium, we face competition from hospitals that provide routine laboratory testing in-house,
as well as from nationwide private laboratories such as Straco, Sonic Healthcare, Amedes and
Synlab. We believe that in 2014 we held a market share of approximately 10% of the Belgian
ambulatory biology testing market, based on our revenue, making us the third largest private

103


-----

provider of routine testing in Belgium, due in part to our leading presence in the Flanders region.
The Belgian ambulatory biology testing market is reasonably concentrated, where the three
largest private providers collectively accounted for 63% of the market share in 2014.

In Luxembourg, we compete with hospitals and with the other two private laboratories in
Luxembourg, Laboratoires Réunis and Laboratoire Forges du Sud. We believe that in 2015 we
held a market share of approximately 45% of the Luxembourg biology testing market, based on
revenue, which makes us the largest private ambulatory care routine laboratory in Luxembourg.
The Luxembourg biology testing market is highly concentrated, where we believe the two largest
private providers collectively accounted for 80% of the market share in 2015.

In UAE, we are part of the independent laboratories segment, with Menalabs occupying the fifth
position in this segment accounting for 2% of this segment’s market share by revenue in 2015
(according to an industry report prepared by a major third party consulting firm) and competing
both with other independent laboratories as well as private and public hospitals and clinics in
this highly fragmented market dominated by private and public hospitals and clinics. Over the
last five years, large independent diagnostic companies have gained market share as hospitals
and clinics have increased outsourcing to higher volume diagnostics clinics as a solution to
accommodate volume while reducing costs. Current market configuration offers further room for
consolidation in the coming years.

_Specialized Testing_

Because the services provided by specialized testing laboratories affect the delivery of healthcare,
a large proportion of the tests performed by participants in this industry have rates set by central
health authorities. Market participants are thus limited in the prices that they can charge
patients or healthcare providers for services rendered and price competition is limited to only
those tests that are outside the official testing catalog of the various public health authorities.
Such pricing constraints do not apply in countries where pricing is liberalized, and international
laboratories are able to set pricing competitively in such markets. However, most firms are
limited to competing based on the breadth of their testing offerings, the amount of time it takes
for test results to be made available to patients and the reliability of the logistics involved in
sample transport.

Although we perform specialized tests for clients located in over 50 countries in Europe, North
Africa and the Middle East, France generated 92% of our Specialized Testing net sales for the
year ended December 31, 2016. We believe that in 2015, we held a leading share of the public
and private specialized testing business in France, based on revenue. Today, we believe we are
the co-leader in the French specialized testing market. Our main competitor in France is Biomnis
(Eurofins). We also face a marginal amount of competition in France from public hospital
laboratories. Outside France, we face competition from local participants and large international
firms.

**_Market Trends_**

_Routine Lab_
_Shift to Preventive Care, Early Detection and Companion Diagnostics_

Western European governments continue to face unprecedented financial strain and seek to rein
in healthcare spending in order to meet deficit reduction goals. Concluding that it is less
expensive to prevent a disease than to treat one after its onset, health ministries have pursued
policies that strongly favor preventive care in addition to a push for more accurate diagnostic
testing to facilitate early detection of disease. Further, doctors are increasingly prescribing clinical
laboratory tests to help identify potential diseases for early detection and to monitor patients
throughout the course of an illness to evaluate treatment and make modifications as necessary.
This shift is leading to greater reliance on diagnostic testing services. The portion of overall
healthcare expenditure worldwide allocated to prediction, diagnosis and disease monitoring is

104


-----

expected to increase from approximately 30% in 2010 to 40% in 2020, at the expense of
expenditures allocated to treatment, according to an industry report prepared by a major third
party consulting firm. As technologies develop over the long term, we believe in a trend favoring
companion diagnostics, or the use of genetic markers to select individualized treatments and
develop individualized prevention plans. We believe that this trend has the potential of creating
overall greater demand for laboratory testing and, consequently, increased volumes.

_Volume Trends_

We believe that demographic trends and changes in lifestyles are leading to increased demand,
and consequently increased volume, for medical testing. As life expectancy continues to grow in
Europe, the number of persons aged 60 and over is expected to increase as well. INSEE reported
that the French population aged 60 and over accounted for approximately 24% of the total
population in 2015, while in 2000 it accounted for approximately 21%. Moreover, according to
INSEE’s central estimate, this age group would increase by 4.5 million between 2015 and 2030. As
a result of such continuing trends, one in three persons in France will be aged 60 and over in
2060. Further, similar aging trends can be seen in Luxembourg, where the proportion of the
population aged 60 and over has increased in recent years and is likely to continue to increase.
Older populations have greater demand for healthcare and testing. Further, recent years have
seen the growth of chronic diseases that result from certain lifestyle choices, such as low levels of
physical activity, malnutrition and stress, including chronic illnesses related to obesity. We believe
that these demographic and public health trends will lead to increased demand for healthcare
services and, as a result, increase the volume of medical testing.

We believe that volume growth will continue to be mitigated in part by government efforts to
control healthcare spending. As governments face pressure to reduce deficits due to the current
economic climate, they have turned to several measures to reduce expenditures, including
putting pressure on testing volumes through excluding certain prescriptions from reimbursement
and other measures.

_Pricing Trends_

The pressure to reduce budget deficits has also led to tariff reductions in the routine laboratory
testing market. In France, Belgium and Luxembourg, laboratory tariff levels are regularly
updated.

In France, the CNAM (Caisse Nationale d’Assurance Maladie) revises the price catalog for
laboratory tests on an annual basis. Stakeholders renewed the 2014-2016 agreement for the
2017-2019 period, maintaining the market growth cap at 0.25%. Pricing continues to be the
variable used by the government to stabilize or slightly increase the overall healthcare spending.
Pricing adjustments are expected to be realized through revisions to the reimbursement
classification of medical tests (Nomenclature des Actes de Biologie Médicale (NABM)). Between
2006 and 2015, 33% of the approximately 810 tests listed in the NABM had their prices lowered
over the period.

In Belgium, increase in health expenses is limited to 1.5% per year. Price controls prevent any
substantial increase in expenses. In addition, audits on the evolution of medical testing
prescriptions are performed regularly. In our case, this has led to a high degree of variability,
positive and negative, in price movements from one year to another.

_Technological Evolution and Quality Standards_
As new technologies develop, resulting in higher quality standards for testing, laboratories are
likely to experience pressure to upgrade and adopt new standards. For example, French
regulatory reforms enacted in 2013 require that clinical laboratories conform to stricter ISO
operating standards by 2020. Improvements in medical and information technologies and quality
standards are also shaping the private clinical laboratory services market on a broader level. In
facilitating more timely and effective decisions, such advances in information technologies and

105


-----

quality standards ultimately improve patient care and reduce medical costs. The costs of
compliance with new quality standards and the continual need to invest in new testing
equipment favors larger participants with greater resources available for these expenditures. We
believe that laboratories are voluntarily adhering to increasingly strict standards of quality as a
means of differentiating themselves from their competitors.

_Market Consolidation_

We believe that the routine laboratory testing market in Europe, particularly in France, is
becoming less fragmented through the combined influence of pricing pressures from payers,
increasingly liberal regulatory frameworks and enhanced quality and accreditation standards.
Regulatory restrictions on outsourcing quotas and staffing quotas for clinical laboratories have
been lifted over recent years in order to rationalize delivery of healthcare services and reduce the
costs paid by social security systems. Further, fixed compliance costs have increased due to stricter
safety and quality control standards (including mandatory COFRAC accreditations in France).
These higher fixed costs, combined with budget cutting measures to reduce or contain
reimbursement rates, have increasingly encouraged consolidation among market participants
aiming to achieve economies of scale and other related synergies. Consolidated networks of
laboratories are able to move toward a more industrialized model of clinical testing and
transform the rest of the network into collection centers where samples are collected and
transferred to a technical platform for testing. The operation of networks of collection centers
around a central technical platform allows for larger volumes of tests, as well as cost efficiencies
for reagent costs and equipment and administrative costs. Given that patients generally choose
the clinical laboratories where they are tested based on the proximity to their home or
workplace, denser networks of collection centers naturally allow for increased patient coverage,
and subsequently volumes. Consolidation allows laboratories to achieve a critical size necessary
to make up for diminishing marginal revenues from individual tests due to government-imposed
tariff reductions. Such consolidation could increase the market share of medium-and large-scale
laboratory groups with a preexisting footprint and level of expertise, and could accelerate the
entrance of large competitors in the European market. Examples of such consolidation include
Synlab and Labco, our acquisition of Novescia in 2015 or the Alpha Medical acquisition by Unilabs
in 2017.

_Outsourcing_

The outsourcing by public and private hospital laboratories to the benefit of private
organizations is another trend observed in the European routine laboratory testing market over
the last few years. In the long term, we believe that outsourcing will provide greater revenue for
groups such as ours. We believe that the French, Belgian, Luxembourg and UAE markets may
provide us with further outsourcing opportunities in the near future.

_Specialized Testing_

The market for specialized laboratory testing is affected by trends similar to those affecting the
market for routine laboratory testing described above.

_Shift to Preventive Care, Early Detection and Companion Diagnostics_

The share of overall healthcare spending dedicated to prediction, diagnosis and disease
monitoring worldwide is expected to increase from approximately 30% in 2010 to 40% by 2020,
as a result of governments’ emphasis on disease prevention as a means of reducing the costs
associated with disease treatment. We believe that specialized laboratory testing stands to
benefit substantially from this policy shift. For example, specialized tests such as cytogenetic
testing for specific disease markers can be a very powerful tool for predicting, and ultimately
preventing, many illnesses. As technologies develop over the long term, we believe there will be
a trend favoring companion diagnostics, or the use of genetic markers to select individualized
treatments and develop individualized prevention plans. The trend can already be observed
through the increasing demand for companion diagnostics using genetic testing. As specialized

106


-----

tests continue to develop as means for accurately predicting disease onset and drug interactions,
we believe that physicians will be inclined to rely on them further in their clinical practice.

_Pricing Trends_

Because specialized laboratory testing is a part of the healthcare system, prices are regulated by
state medical insurance authorities and third-party payers in a similar manner to prices for
routine laboratory testing. As a result, our specialized laboratory testing business is also affected
by government pressures to limit the increase in healthcare expenditure. We believe that efforts
to limit the rate of growth in healthcare expenditure will result in further reductions in
regulatory tariffs in the future. However, we expect price pressures to be less than in our Routine
Lab business, given that relatively low prices already prevail in France for specialized tests and
that a meaningful proportion of innovative ultra-specialty tests are not yet subject to regulatory
tariffs. Despite pricing pressures, reimbursement rates from public authorities and the number of
tests that are covered by social security systems have remained relatively stable. Although our
Specialized Testing business outside France is not subject to price regulation, we need to price
our offerings competitively with respect to local laboratories, which may be subject to price
regulations and on behalf of whom we perform specialized tests.

_Volume Trends_

We believe that the demand for specialized testing is increasing as European populations age
and their healthcare needs increase. We also believe that a continuing trend toward preventive
and predictive care will increase demand for laboratory testing, including the tests we perform in
our Specialized Testing business. Public hospitals facing increased demand for specialized tests
are expected to increasingly outsource, driving greater volumes to private laboratories such as
ours. However, we believe that such an increase in outsourcing will be balanced by an increase in
the internalization of specialized testing functions by regional groups of laboratories that, due to
regulatory liberalization, are able to consolidate and combine forces to achieve the necessary
scale to perform certain specialized tests on a cost-efficient basis, subject to achieving the
required scope and logistics capabilities to make this economical. Testing volumes for specialized
laboratories may be negatively impacted from time to time by technological progress as
customers may find it more cost-efficient to insource certain specialized tests if affordable
equipment becomes available in the market.

_Market Consolidation_

The consolidation of the private laboratories market in France may result in some volume shifts
between the two main participants, Cerba and Biomnis (Eurofins), as each participant’s
consolidated network tends to outsource its volumes to one specialized laboratory for efficiency
purposes.

_Scientific Advancements and Quality Standards_

Because price competition is limited due to regulatory constraints, specialized laboratory testing
market participants typically compete and seek to differentiate themselves on the perceived
quality of their test offerings, their capacity for innovation and the scientific know-how of their
staff. Specialized laboratory testing is also subject to the heightened regulatory accreditation
standards that are currently in place in France and that are being implemented elsewhere in
Europe; see “Regulation.”

_Globalization_

We derived 9% of the net sales of our Specialized Testing business for the year ended
December 31, 2015 (8% in 2016) from markets outside of France, including other countries in
Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. With increased improvements in logistics services and
the capacity to transport samples reliably and quickly over long distances, we believe that the
market for specialized laboratory testing will continue to develop on a global scale, with large
participants competing for market share around the world.

107

#### Central Lab

We provide central laboratory testing services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
and contract research organizations (CROs) in connection with the clinical trial phase of their
drug development processes. In 2015, the central laboratory testing market was estimated by a
major third party consulting firm to be worth over $2.8 billion worldwide. The central laboratory
business is largely tied to the activity of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

CROs provide all inclusive outsourced clinical services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies, including IT support, patient selection and logistical services. They provide their
services throughout the clinical testing cycle, from preclinical testing to Phase IV studies and new
drug applications. Reference laboratories such as our Central Lab business work with both
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and CROs by performing clinical pathology testing
to provide data on a test product’s usefulness and clinical safety.

New pharmaceutical product candidates generally go through three phases of clinical testing
before being marketed to the general public for use, potentially followed by an additional phase
of post-marketing surveillance:

_Phase I._ In Phase I, a drug is initially introduced into a small number of human subjects and
tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.

_Phase II._ Phase II involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to further identify
possible adverse effects and safety risks and to determine the optimal dosage for dose tolerance
and efficacy of the product candidate for the specific target disease.

_Phase III._ Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and
to further test for safety in an expanded patient population, at geographically dispersed clinical
study sites. Phase III clinical trials usually include a broader patient population so that safety and
efficacy can be substantially established across a wide range of genetic variation. Phase III clinical
trials cannot begin until Phase II evaluation demonstrates that a dosage range of the product
may be effective (which is often referred to as demonstrating “proof of concept”) and has an
acceptable safety profile. In the event that Phase III testing yields desired results, pharmaceutical
companies will apply to have the compound approved by the relevant regulators.

_Phase IV._ Phase IV clinical trials are performed if a regulator requires, or a pharmaceutical
company pursues, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These clinical trials may be
made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. The results of Phase IV clinical
trials can confirm the efficacy of a product candidate and can provide important supplementary
safety information.

Our central laboratory testing services mainly concern Phases II and III of clinical testing.

Pricing in the central laboratory testing business is not tariff-regulated, and is set contractually
with the customers. This greater flexibility enables more intense, price-based competition among
market participants. Additionally, the market is not limited to a particular geographic location;
nearly all the laboratories engaged in central laboratory testing operate on a multinational level.

Central Lab customers’ contracts vary in duration from six to 60 months, depending on the length
of the particular clinical trial. Pricing is determined on a per test basis and is generally fixed,
although we may offer customers rebates based on the achievement of specified volumes of
testing. We are subject to liability if we fail to perform tests in a timely manner. Contracts may be
terminated at any time at will by Central Lab customers, without indemnification. If a customer
cancels or terminates a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services
performed up to the cancellation or termination date.

108

**_Competition_**

The central laboratory testing market has a wide range of participants, from small providers of
limited, highly specialized services to full-service global organizations. Our central laboratory
testing business competes with the in-house research departments of pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, limited and full-service CROs and public institutions such as universities
and hospitals.

We believe that we are a significant participant in the global central laboratory testing industry,
with a recognized expertise in hepatology, onco-hematology and companion diagnostics,
according to industry surveys. The four largest providers in the market (Covance/Labcorp, ICON,
PPD and Quintiles/Quest) are estimated to account for approximately 60% of market share,
according to an industry report prepared by a major third party consulting firm. We compete
mainly with these large participants and several other national and international mid-sized
companies.

Factors that affect a laboratory’s competitive outlook include:

- the prices for its services;

- the scope of its testing offerings;

- its scientific and medical expertise;

- its ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in a rapid and accurate manner;

- its historic experience and customer relationships; and

- the quality of its laboratory facilities.

**_Market Trends_**

_Pricing Trends_

Pricing in the centralized laboratory testing market is set competitively based on negotiations
with the customers, i.e., the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and CROs. In addition,
as the market consolidation trend continues (as described below), we believe that laboratories
could drive prices down further and intensify price-based competition. However, because the cost
of analytical testing performed by centralized laboratory testing companies accounts for a
relatively small portion of the total cost of conducting clinical trials, we believe that downward
pricing pressure from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and CROs will be limited.

_Market Consolidation_

We believe the number of smaller laboratories is likely to decrease following European
regulatory reforms requiring more stringent, and therefore costlier, certification requirements
for the registration of new drugs. Further, price-based competition favors larger participants able
to provide economies of scale. Finally, larger laboratories have greater resources with which to
satisfy regulatory operating standards and to attract scientific talent. As a result, we believe that
the market is ripe for further consolidation, leading to higher concentration of market share
among larger participants.

_Reinforced Need for New Products to Replace Aging Blockbusters_

The past several decades in the pharmaceutical industry have been marked by “blockbuster”
drugs that provided unprecedented levels of revenue to pharmaceutical companies. As time
passes, patents providing exclusivity on such successful drugs expire, allowing generic
manufacturers to produce and sell such drugs, thereby decreasing the pharmaceutical company’s
revenue streams. Pharmaceutical companies seek new replacement drugs to maintain profits. We

109


-----

believe this results in additional spending for R&D to develop new drugs, which will in turn lead
to more business for CROs and central laboratories such as us. Further, we believe new drug
applications continue to be increasingly complex, leading to greater demand for specialized
central laboratories with the expertise to support the patenting and regulatory approval of new
drugs.

_Outsourcing of R&D_

Due to decreased margins from the expiry of patents of former blockbuster drugs, pressure on
prices from payers and the general economic downturn, pharmaceutical companies are seeking
to innovate while focusing on their core competencies and reduce costs. We believe that their
desire to reduce costs leads to an increase in the outsourcing of their clinical trial functions.
Because CROs and reference laboratories specialize in the support of new drug development,
they are better positioned to identify and exploit market efficiencies, and as a result operate
more efficiently. Consequently, we believe pharmaceutical companies find it increasingly cost
efficient to outsource their clinical trial functions entirely to CROs and reference laboratories
rather than maintaining this function in-house at higher costs. Further, while cost pressures have
forced large pharmaceutical companies to reframe their operations around their core
competencies, smaller and mid-sized companies have been able to develop without large
companies’ higher operating costs, in part due to the outsourcing of a large portion of their R&D
functions. These companies have become an increasingly important driver of the growth of the
pharmaceutical industry. We believe these smaller companies will continue to provide an
important source of business for Central Lab.

_Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

#### Our History

We were founded in 1967 in France as Laboratoires Cerba, a laboratory focused on specialized
testing for local medical laboratories and hospitals. We continued to develop our expertise in
high quality specialized laboratory testing over the years, aided by our acquisition of the
specialized medical biology department of the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1998. This acquisition
made us a leading specialized testing laboratory in Europe. Since then, we have pursued a
strategy of diversifying our business both in terms of services provided and geographical
coverage. With our acquisition of BARC in 2007, we expanded into the central laboratory testing
business as well as the routine laboratory testing business in Belgium. We have continued to
expand our Routine Lab business through a series of strategic acquisitions since then, including
French laboratories such as Cerballiance Hauts-de-France (formerly Biolille) in the Lille
metropolitan area in 2009, Cerballiance Paris in the Paris area and Cerballiance Provence
(formerly Biotop Développement) in the Marseille area in 2010, Cerballiance Pyrénées (formerly
BioPyrénées Lab SELAS) in southwestern France, Cerballiance Réunion (formerly Bioréunion) in La
Réunion, SELAS de la Baie in Brittany in 2011 and JS Bio in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region
as well as laboratories in Luxembourg, such as Ketterthill Laboratories (which we acquired
through our acquisition of LLAM in 2011), and Belgium, such as Medic Lab, which we acquired in
2011. In 2015, we completed the strategic acquisition of Novescia to further expand our
geographical coverage in our core French market and to strengthen our business with private
hospitals, a significant source of business for Novescia. In 2016, we acquired a majority stake in
Menalabs, a network of routine laboratories in the United Arab Emirates, to expand our network
to the Middle East. In the same year we also acquired Antagène S.A., a veterinary laboratory in
France, to diversify our business portfolio. From a single collection center in 2007, we have grown
to operate approximately 360 collection centers with a staff of approximately 415 clinical
pathologists as of December 31, 2016.

A number of transactions have been conducted in the past with respect to the control and
ownership of our Group, most notably in 2010 with the purchase by PAI, our previous
shareholders, of a majority stake in our holding company. Following the completion of the
Transactions, the Sponsors will be the Group’s indirect majority shareholders and certain
members of our management team will hold a minority stake in our holding company.

#### Our Competitive Strengths

Our business benefits from a number of competitive strengths, including:

**_Integrated, Efficient and Diversified Business Model_**

We operate an integrated, efficient and diversified business model based on strong and
recognized medical expertise, as well as proven industrial and organizational know how. Our
reputation for scientific excellence, inherited from our historical specialty business founded in
1967 in France as well as our Central Lab business founded in 1985 in Belgium, benefits the entire
organization through cross selling, cost synergies, training, technical support and sharing of best
practices, as well as quicker and easier access to technology and to top-trained clinical

112


-----

pathologists. We believe our reputation for scientific excellence is particularly valuable to our
Specialized Testing and Central Lab businesses and is a significant strength as we look to
continue taking part in the consolidation of the routine lab market. Our reputation boosts our
credibility as a market consolidator. Through its link with the medical and pharmaceutical
communities, our Central Lab business provides us with insights into new clinical pathology tests
being developed in the industry. The strong medical expertise of our Group and its exposure to
rare pathologies also help attract and retain top-trained clinical pathologists. We believe our
Central Lab business leverages our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing infrastructure, equipment
and clinical pathologists to perform safe and cost effective testing of new drugs, thereby
generating significant cost synergies.

Our business model also benefits from our strong experience in managing large scale technical
and logistical networks, which allows us not only to expand our different businesses organically
and geographically, but also to optimize internal synergies between them. In particular, our
strong logistics expertise, based on outsourced operations managed by in-house experts, allows
us to optimize our size and organization in a cost and operationally effective way.

Our presence across all segments of the industry also allows us to benefit from the entire life
cycle of a test, from its early and confidential use, as part of a drug trial in Central Lab, to its
more common use in Specialized Testing through to its massive dissemination as a routine test.
Finally, our integrated business model has allowed us to better absorb pricing pressures and
improve profitability by negotiating more advantageous purchasing conditions with our reagent
and equipment suppliers. We regularly invest in the latest technological advances in our field and
are able to attract and retain leading clinical pathologists.

**_Leading Market Positions Across Routine, Specialty and Central Lab Testing_**

We are the only clinical pathology laboratory in Europe with leading market positions in all its
European geographies and across all three segments of the clinical laboratory services industry
based on revenue. We believe that we are the largest private network of clinical pathology
laboratories in France in terms of 2016 run-rate revenues, one of the two national scale networks
and one of the top four private players in Europe by net sales, based on management estimates.
We also believe that, based on management estimates for 2016, we were among the three
largest private providers of routine testing in Belgium and the largest private ambulatory care
routine laboratories in Luxembourg. In Specialized Testing, our historical core business, we
believe that we were co-leader of the market in France based on management estimates for
2016, with customers in more than 50 countries across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.
Finally, we believe we are a significant player in the Central Lab market worldwide, based on
management estimates for 2016. Our position in the three segments in which we operate enables
us to attract top-trained clinical pathologists and to be at the forefront of both technological and
medical advancements in the clinical pathology industry as a result of our close relationships with
the medical and scientific communities. Our position as a leader has made us a key player in the
consolidation of the routine market.

We believe we offer one of the largest catalogs of routine and specialized clinical tests in Europe,
with over 2,500 tests as of December 31, 2016, of which approximately 1,500 are highly
specialized in molecular clinical pathology, immunology, cellular clinical pathology, bacteriology,
hormonology, oncology and rare biochemistry. As of December 31, 2016, we employed
approximately 415 clinical pathologists who perform and interpret clinical tests processed on our
technical platforms and assist external clinical pathologists and doctors in their diagnostics.

**_Resilient and Growing Market Underpinned by Strong Fundamentals and Further_**
**_Growth Opportunities_**

The European clinical laboratory services market has been characterized by resilient growth over
the past several years, including through economic downturns, benefiting from favorable

113


-----

demographic and scientific trends. The private clinical laboratory testing market in France is
estimated to have experienced approximately 2.5% compound annual growth from 2006 to
2011, reflecting the net effect of tariff decreases and the combined growth effect of volume and
mix. From 2011 to 2014 the market experienced a 0.6% average decrease in value as a
consequence of new test coefficient reductions. From 2014 onwards, the market stabilized due to
a three-year agreement capping the growth of overall testing spending at 0.25% per year from
2014 to 2016. In Belgium, the total clinical laboratory testing market experienced annual growth
between 1% and 2% since 2012, and the ambulatory biology market in Luxembourg grew at a
rate of approximately 8% per year over the last 10 years.

Past growth of the routine and specialty testing markets has been supported by strong
demographic trends in our geographical markets. Contrary to certain other European countries,
the population in France, our main market, continues to grow. In the meantime, as life
expectancy continues to increase in Europe generally, the number of people aged 60 and over
(an age from which many people request and need more medical treatments) increases too. In
addition, as birth rates remain relatively high in our markets, particularly in France, pregnant
women also generate a significant volume of medical testing.

Public health and scientific trends have also been key drivers of the growth of the routine and
specialty testing markets. As it is often less expensive to prevent a disease than to treat it,
governments have pursued policies that favor preventive care, in addition to encouraging more
accurate and sophisticated tests to facilitate early detection. We believe, based on publicly
available information, that from 2010 to 2020, the percentage of overall healthcare expenditure
worldwide dedicated to diagnosis, prediction and disease monitoring will increase from
approximately 30% to 40%. Finally, chronic diseases, which generally require regular testing for
monitoring purposes, have increased in recent years likely due to certain lifestyle trends, such as
low levels of physical activity, malnutrition, stress and pollution.

We believe that in addition to these favorable demographic and public health fundamentals,
other trends support an increase in the volume of medical testing, and thus support the future
growth of our different markets. In particular:

- we believe that new tests will emerge as technologies develop and personalization of
prevention and treatment will become the norm, further offering growth opportunities for our
specialized testing segment; we believe that the market continues to shift progressively to
preventive care, early detection and companion diagnostics;

- we also believe that the consolidation of the routine laboratory testing market in Europe is
continuing, in particular in France, which is still fragmented, with approximately 2,195 legal
entities or approximately 3,876 collection centers as of December 2014;

- state budget reductions, as well as regulatory liberalization, create pressure to outsource
routine and specialized tests from the public sector; in 2015, revenue from the private French
clinical laboratory testing totaled approximately €4.3 billion, representing approximately 60%
of the overall French clinical laboratory testing market; and

- with respect to the central lab market, we believe that the pharmaceutical industry’s need to
market new drugs to replace aging blockbusters, as well as the further outsourcing of
pharmaceutical companies’ R&D capabilities, continues to increase demand for central lab
testing.

**_Significant Barriers to Entry_**

The European testing markets in which we operate are characterized by national regulatory and
structural specificities which make them more difficult and costly to penetrate for potential new
entrants. We believe that scientific reputation, technical capabilities, market and regulatory

114

knowledge, as well as critical size, all of which are characteristics of Cerba, are key elements that
will be necessary to be able to fully benefit from future growth opportunities.

We believe our Group is well known for scientific excellence and cutting edge technical knowhow. Inherited from our historical core specialty lab business founded in 1967 in France and our
central lab business founded in 1985 in Belgium, this reputation, which has allowed us to
establish strong relationships with the scientific community and to establish a renowned brand
name in the medical laboratory testing industry, constitutes an invaluable advantage over
potential new entrants, in particular in Central Lab where referral processes are long and
difficult.

We operate in a highly regulated market with stringent regulations and strict accreditation
procedures governing the granting or the renewal of a license to operate a laboratory. Securing
these mandatory accreditations entails significant investment and lengthy and complex processes
making it increasingly difficult for new entrants to penetrate the market. For example, the
existing administrative authorization process for the establishment and operation of clinical
laboratories in France will be replaced in November 2020 by a new accreditation procedure,
COFRAC accreditation, that will introduce new, stricter requirements pursuant to the ISO
standard. COFRAC accreditation is being implemented gradually and, since November 2016, 50%
of the tests performed by a laboratory already have to be accredited. We are compliant with this
requirement. In November 2018, 70% of the tests performed by a laboratory will have to be
accredited. The COFRAC accreditation process is costly and time consuming. As such, it constitutes
a significant barrier to entry for new entrants and a significant burden for existing small labs. In
addition, the legal constraints in the French market regarding mandatory shareholding of clinical
pathologists with which we believe we already comply, constitute a significant barrier to entry
into the French routine market. The stringent price regulations applicable to the routine and
specialty markets in which we operate also constitute serious obstacles for new entrants as these
price constraints favor well established and large players who benefit from their existing
reputation and large scale to implement a cost effective model. Finally, we believe that in France,
new networks would be difficult to create as the opening of new laboratories or collection
centers requires several regulatory approvals, which are only rarely obtained as the market is
already well covered by a large number of laboratories.

We also believe that size and scale, which would be highly difficult and costly to achieve in the
short term for any new entrant, are key strengths for larger market participants like us. We
believe that larger participants, with well-established and integrated logistical capabilities, are
better equipped and positioned to treat high volume testing in a more cost effective way, to
consolidate the routine market where necessary, to secure loyalty from outsourcing (for specialty
lab) and commercial (for central lab) partners, to optimize synergies within the different testing
businesses and, finally, to seize growth opportunities in new geographical markets.

Finally, we believe that the logistics organization of our Specialized Testing business is a valuable
asset that would be difficult for new entrants to replicate. For cost and operational efficiency, we
have outsourced the operation of our logistics network to a trusted partner, which is ISO
accredited and is in charge of the collection and transportation of samples. While we have
outsourced this aspect of the logistics for our Specialized Testing Business, we maintain in-house
the management and proprietary mapping of the network. This model, as well as our strong inhouse logistics expertise and experience, allow us to collect an average of approximately 24,000
samples per day, from more than 3,000 locations worldwide, and to ensure that all tubes arrive
before 7 a.m. in our specialty laboratory in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, near Paris, France, to be tested
and the results returned to clients within 24 hours.

**_Proven Consolidation Strategy with a Structured Approach to Acquisitions_**

Founded as a specialty laboratory in 1967, we have since then expanded into new businesses and
new geographies through acquisitions. With our acquisition of BARC in 2007, we expanded into
the central laboratory testing business as well as the routine laboratory testing business in
Belgium. We have continued to expand our Routine Lab business through several strategic
acquisitions in highly populated geographic areas of France (such as Cerballiance Hauts-de-France
in the Lille metropolitan area in 2009, Cerballiance Paris (formerly CBCV) in the Paris area in 2010,
Cerballiance Provence (formerly Biotop Développement) in the Marseille area in 2010, JS Bio in
the Provence–Alpes–Côte d’Azur area in 2014 and Novescia in 2015), and Luxembourg (such as
Ketterthill Laboratories, which we acquired through our acquisition of LLAM in 2011),
complemented by a series of bolt-on acquisitions. While strategic acquisitions are more complex
and less frequent, they enable us to expand into new geographic zones, such as the acquisition
of a majority stake in Menalabs in the United Arab Emirates in 2016 and of DeltaMedica in Italy
in February 2017, or into complementary segments, such as the acquisition of Antagène S.A., a
veterinary laboratory in France, in August 2016. Significant portions of the European clinical
laboratory services market, especially the French market, remain fragmented. These markets
present opportunities for consolidation and growth. The laboratories we acquire through these
strategic acquisitions often serve as technical platforms regional clusters and perform the entire
clinical laboratory testing for the region. We complement these strategic acquisitions with
smaller bolt-on acquisitions of laboratories that we transform into collection centers where
samples are collected from patients and sent to the technical platforms for testing. Through this
regional clusterization strategy built around technical platforms, we have built a very dense
network of laboratories centered around eleven regional clusters in France, two in Belgium and
one in Luxembourg. From a single collection center in 2007, we have grown to operate
approximately 360 collection centers with a staff of approximately 415 clinical pathologists as of
December 31, 2016. We have completed 59 acquisitions from 2009 to 2016. In the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 alone, we completed three, seven and five acquisitions,
respectively, of which respectively two, five and four were bolt-on acquisitions.

In addition, certain regulatory changes, such as the introduction of mandatory accreditation and
higher quality standards in France, generally benefit larger laboratory companies or networks
like ours. Since 2007, we have been an active consolidator in the routine lab market, and we
believe we are well positioned to capitalize on additional opportunities in France as well as in
potential new markets. We have a dedicated team of four professionals focused on finding,
evaluating and executing external growth opportunities and have developed a structured
approach to acquisitions that capitalizes on the expertise and market knowledge of our senior
management and local laboratory doctors. The laboratory companies we acquire are often clients
or competitors of ours with whom we have had prior business interaction. This in-depth
knowledge of the industry helps us pre-select suitable acquisition targets. Our track record
demonstrates a disciplined approach to acquisitions, including the setting of internal acquisition
multiple targets and high due diligence standards, which include the participation of our senior
executives at various stages of the acquisition process. We believe that the fragmentation of the
French clinical laboratory market, together with the slow-growth economy in the past several
years, allows us to complete acquisitions of clinical laboratories at attractive prices.

Post-acquisition, we generally implement cost reduction initiatives aimed at increasing the
profitability of the clinical laboratories we acquire through economies of scale and the sharing of
best practices with the rest of the network. Historically, we have been able to extract a
substantial amount of synergies from our acquisitions. Certain synergies from bolt-on acquisitions
can be realized upon closing of the acquisition such as savings on reagent costs. We also achieve
reductions in technical and administrative expenses as we shift technical and administrative
functions to our technical platforms and redeploy the personnel of the acquired entity across our
network of technical platforms, which can be a lengthy process taking more than 24 months
after acquisition in certain cases. However, due to voluntary departures resulting from the

116


-----

redeployment process of our workforce to our regional platforms, some cost reductions relating
to personnel can be quickly realized. In 2016, we have re-branded our entire network in France
under the brand Cerballiance to develop the reputation of the Group, introduce the new brand
to all clients and unite the employees around our brand.

**_Track Record of a Strong and Sustained Financial Performance, with High Margin and_**
**_Strong Cash Flow Generation_**

We have demonstrated sustained net sales compound annual growth of 18.2% between the year
ended December 31, 2009 (predecessor of Cerba HealthCare) and the year ended December 31,
2016. This sales growth has been underpinned by our acquisition strategy as we have sought to
increase our market share in the Routine Lab testing market.

Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2016 increased from
22.7% to 23.0%, demonstrating our ability to rapidly integrate acquired companies, realize
synergies and gain greater operating leverage through our increased scale. We have developed
and are implementing numerous cost initiatives that allow us to further control our costs by
optimizing our relationships with our suppliers, our logistics operations and our information
technology systems. This disciplined investment and cost control strategy has allowed us to
achieve a significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA margins over the years.

Finally, our business benefits from relatively low capital expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and
working capital requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, our net
capital expenditures (excluding asset acquisitions), were €9.5 million, €23.0 million and
€22.8 million, respectively. As a percentage of our net sales, capital expenditure (excluding asset
acquisitions) amounted to 2.4%, 4.1% and 3.6% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015
and 2016, respectively. Due to this favorable business model, we were able to generate strong
cash flow as reflected by our cash conversion rate of 89.5% for 2014, 79.7% for 2015 and 84.3%
for 2016 (cash conversion rate, expressed as a percentage, is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus
capital expenditure (excluding asset acquisitions), divided by Adjusted EBITDA), generating the
capacity to de-lever while continuing to support our acquisition strategy.

**_Well_** **_Regarded and_** **_Experienced Management Team_** **_at_** **_Group Level and Unique_**
**_Governance and Ownership Structure at Operational Level_**

We benefit from the experience and industry know how of our current senior management
team. In particular, Catherine Rondot Courboillet, our CEO and a highly regarded industry
specialist in Europe, Jérôme Thill, our deputy CEO, Sylvie Cado, head of our Specialized Testing
business, Philippe Buhl, head of our Routine Labs in France and Cyril Dubreuil, our sales and
business development director, each of whom has more than eight years of experience in the
industry. Our management team has an average of 20 years’ industry experience and an average
of 16 years’ experience in the Group.

Moreover, our ownership model is based on a strong entrepreneurial culture, where more than
100 laboratory doctors and managers are shareholders of our structure, at our holding company
level and at the different operating laboratories levels. Our ownership model and structure gives
us overall strategic control, while also incentivizing doctors and managers to fully contribute to a
common commercial, scientific and industrial project and greatly rewarding commitment,
development and innovation. For example, in 2013, we were the first medical lab to bring highly
innovative non-invasive pre-natal testing to market in Europe. We believe that our ownership
structure is key to the strength and success of our model.

Following completion of the Acquisition, we also expect our business to benefit from the market
expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our future shareholders, Partners
Group and PSP Investments.

#### Our Strategy

Based in particular on our strong scientific reputation and expertise, our strategy mainly consists
of becoming a leading network in the French routine lab market through consolidation, while
maintaining our unique positioning in the European specialty and central lab businesses. The key
elements of our strategy are:

**_Drive Organic Volume Growth Across Our Business Segments_**

The core of our Group’s strategy consists of developing organically each of our different business
segments through coordinated but tailored action plans.

With respect to our Routine Lab business, our strategy encompasses operational and functional
alignment between our regional clusters, which is facilitated by the deployment of a dedicated
team. These alignment efforts include the standardization of our routine industrial processes
with respect to technical platform operations, quality assurance and information systems. The
dedicated team in charge of this integration strategy also focuses on improving the management
of our routine staff and the organization of our networks. We are also further developing our
retail strategy through relocation of our laboratories into new, more attractive or convenient
locations, and a rebranding of our entire network in France under the Cerballiance brand. Our
strategy with respect to the organic growth of our Routine Lab business includes the selection of
those of our youngest laboratory doctors with the most promising managerial capabilities; we
will provide them with high quality business school training, with the aim of further improving
the management of our laboratories at the local level. Finally, we have a dedicated team of key
account managers focusing on accelerating the penetration of and recruitment of key customers,
such as public hospitals and retirement homes, through partnerships. While such partnerships are
time consuming and expensive to negotiate, due to reasons such as national referencing, site by
site negotiations and entry costs, they offer attractive long-term contracts with secured high
volumes.

In the Specialized Testing market, we are committed first to maintaining our leadership through
the renewal of our catalog of tests, the acceleration of compliance with new ISO regulations and
the improvement of our logistics services, in particular at the international level. We intend to
continue to particularly focus our efforts on profitable organic growth driven mainly by new
tests and, to a lesser degree, by the expansion of our international activity. As a result, we aim to
innovate through new technologies, new tests and enhanced services for customers through
partnerships with hospitals and biotech companies, and through the work of our scientific and
medical committee. We also believe that the combination of our scientific and logistics expertise
positions us well to benefit from future national screening campaigns and epidemics testing. We
also aim to further expand our export activity, leveraging our reputation and logistics capabilities
to reach more customers, including in selective new geographical markets. Our focus on
profitable organic growth also implies the further development of synergies between our
Specialized Testing business and our Central Lab activities, in particular through biomarkers
innovations. Finally, we intend to further foster the general profitability of our Specialized
Testing business, including through the further automation of our processes (such as invoicing
and samples encoding) and the better optimization of new regulations.

Finally, we intend to continue developing our Central Lab business through the further
differentiation of the positioning of BARC. In particular, we aim at capturing organic growth
opportunities of our Central Lab business by broadening our product selection from safety to
tailor made biomarkers and leveraging our strong scientific knowledge and capabilities as well as
our proven specialist approach implemented by a unique team of clinical pathologists, including
through the co-development of new tests with clients. We also intend to further develop our
Central Lab business by further strengthening our position in Europe and Africa, working to
establish a position in Asia, improving client services and adaptability including through price
transparency and competitiveness, strengthening our pure testing player approach (that is, our

118


-----

ability to intervene in all clinical trial phases) and continuing our certification program and our
tailor made reporting approach. Finally, we intend to further strengthen our worldwide lab
networks to capture new contracts and expand our customer base.

**_Selectively Pursue Acquisitions_**

In the French routine lab market, we are organized in eleven regional clusters, which we intend
to expand further. In regions where we are already present, our expansion strategy will include
selected small- and mid-size bolt-on acquisitions that fit into and complement the existing local
networks organized around technical platforms, similar to the acquisition of JS Bio in 2014. To
expand into new regions, we intend to pursue acquisitions of existing regional clusters followed
by further bolt-on acquisitions in line with our clusterization strategy but also to implement
more significant strategic transactions with larger players, such as the acquisition of Novescia in
2015 or Menalabs in 2016. Our strategic focus will be to pursue bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen
and increase our local market share and the density of our regional network. As in the past, we
aim to generate immediate synergies from bolt-on acquisitions by transforming the acquired
small laboratories into collection centers that feed samples to a technical platform where test
analysis is centralized.

In the past, we completed a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our geographical
coverage and gain critical mass in markets outside France. Although our acquisition strategy is
currently focused on the French routine market, we may explore opportunities to purchase larger
laboratory networks in other European countries or to pursue bolt-on acquisitions in regions
adjacent to the markets where we currently operate. As such, our focus will be on regions with
growing and aging populations as well as regions with greater per capita spending on healthcare
services.

Finally, expansion into additional business segments will be another important growth driver for
us in the coming years. We aim to become a national player in the veterinary laboratory market
in France through leveraging our large network of collection centers. We have acquired a second
veterinary laboratory in France in 2016 to further expand our service offering.

**_Continue to Deliver Operating Efficiencies_**

We also intend to continue to take advantage of the economies of scale provided by our
presence in all three segments of the laboratory testing market and by the size of our network to
streamline our operations and administrative functions and to control costs. We are aiming in
particular at controlling costs through the further rationalization of our network (in particular in
France by establishing technical platforms surrounded by a sophisticated and condensed network
of collection centers), the further industrialization and automation of our processes and the
optimization of synergies between our segments and geographies. We also intend to continue
leveraging our size to obtain favorable commercial conditions from suppliers. In cooperation
with our main logistical partners, we are continuing to improve our logistical organization and
optimize samples collection and transportation, seeking logistical synergies between our national
and international activities and between our three business segments. Finally, we continuously
work on the further integration of our laboratories, in particular with respect to those acquired
most recently. In particular, we will seek to optimize our operating costs through the
implementation of group agreements and processes with respect to IT, cars, rentals, external fees
and utilities.

#### Our Specific Corporate Structure

Cerba HealthCare is a société par actions simplifiée organized under French law. Following the
completion of the Acquisition, companies controlled by the Sponsors will own indirectly
approximately 93% of Cerba HealthCare’s share capital and voting rights. The remainder of
Cerba HealthCare’s share capital and voting rights will be owned by members of our senior

119


-----

management and clinical pathologists. For more information on Cerba HealthCare’s shareholders,
see “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions.”

We primarily conduct our business through our subsidiaries. Our French subsidiaries, which
represented 85.0% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, are subject to strict
regulations limiting the ownership of clinical laboratories and the corporate form such
laboratories can take. French law requires that a majority of the share capital and voting rights
of a laboratory company be held by clinical pathologists working in the relevant laboratory. In
addition, persons that are not clinical pathologists or entities that are not laboratory companies
may not own more than 25% of the share capital in a laboratory company. French law also
dictates that clinical laboratories must take the corporate form of an SEL (unless they are
organized as a non-profit organization, or a société civile professionnelle (SCP), or a cooperative
undertaking). For more information on the regulations affecting the corporate form and
ownership of French clinical laboratories, see “Regulation—Regulations Affecting our Routine
_Lab and Specialized Testing Businesses—France—Laboratory Ownership and Corporate_
_Structure.”_

We have organized our corporate structure to remain in compliance with such regulations. Each
of our French laboratory subsidiaries is organized as an SEL, in accordance with French law. Cerba
HealthCare indirectly holds its interests in all of its French operating subsidiaries through our
non-laboratory subsidiary, Cefid, of which Cerba HealthCare owns approximately 99% of the
share capital. In order to comply with SEL ownership restrictions, our corporate structure in
France is such that Cefid holds 25% of the voting rights and share capital in Cerba Selafa, one of
our French laboratory subsidiaries, with the clinical pathologists operating Cerba Selafa holding
the balance, therefore a majority of the share capital and voting rights. The bylaws of Cerba
Selafa allow Cefid to hold approximately 99% of financial rights (rights to receive dividend
payments) in Cerba Selafa. In addition, Cerba Selafa holds up to 49.9% of the voting rights in our
other French laboratory company subsidiaries, with clinical pathologists operating each such
other French laboratory subsidiary holding a majority of the voting rights. Cerba Selafa also holds
between approximately 70% and 99.99% of these subsidiaries’ financial rights.

Clinical pathologists must, under French law, be allowed to exercise their independent judgment
in the conduct of their day to day operations. However, we maintain de facto control over our
subsidiaries’ actions through shareholders agreements, according to which major operating
decisions (such as the incurrence of debt over a specified threshold, corporate mergers, yearly
budgeting, entering into contracts that last for longer than one year or are worth over a
specified threshold, among other things) are subject to a vote of controlling bodies (boards of
directors or strategic committees) in which representatives of our subsidiary shareholders have a
veto right. We do not, however, exercise control over the appointment by the subsidiary
shareholders of its representatives in the controlling bodies of the French laboratory subsidiaries,
as these decisions can be taken by the clinical pathologists owning a majority of the voting rights
in the subsidiary shareholders. As a result, we are dependent on the clinical pathologists who
hold the majority of the voting rights in our French subsidiaries for decisions affecting these
subsidiaries’ operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not exercise
_full control over the operations of certain of our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority_
_voting interest and are dependent on the clinical pathologists who own a majority voting_
_interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries.” As we acquire new French_
laboratories, we put into place a similar shareholding structure and shareholder agreement with
the clinical pathologists at the newly acquired laboratory.

Regulatory restrictions on the ownership of our subsidiaries in Belgium and Luxembourg are
much less stringent than those imposed by French law. As a result, our corporate structure in
Belgium and Luxembourg is relatively simple. We operate our Routine Lab business in Belgium
and Luxembourg through subsidiaries owned directly and indirectly through our wholly owned
subsidiary BARC, through which we also operate our Central Lab business.

120


-----

We believe that we are in compliance with all regulatory structuring requirements. However,
regulations are subject to change and we could incur significant expense if a regulatory authority
were to take issue with our structure. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are
_subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may face_
_substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be negatively impacted if we fail_
_to comply.”_

#### Our Businesses

We operate three business lines: Routine Lab, Specialized Testing and Central Lab.

**_Routine Lab_**

_Overview_

Our Routine Lab business is our largest line of business and generated €456.5 million of net sales
for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing 72.0% of our total net sales for the same
period.

We operate our Routine Lab business in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the UAE, where we
estimate that we are among the largest clinical private laboratories in terms of revenue. Our
Routine Lab business is highly regulated in each of these jurisdictions, including in terms of price
for our services. See “Industry—Clinical Pathology Testing—Market Overview” and “Regulation—
_Regulations Affecting Our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing Businesses.”_

_Our Routine Lab Services_

Our Routine Lab business performs tests prescribed by doctors and medical institutions in
connection with general patient care to establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or
to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. The most frequently requested tests include:

- blood chemistry analyses;

- urinalyses;

- blood cell counts;

- thyroid tests; and

- cholesterol tests.

In each country, we operate several regional clusters consisting of multiple collection centers
served by one or more technical platforms at which tests are performed. We believe this hub and
spoke model provides an efficient use of our resources. By collecting samples within close
proximity to patients’ homes and workplaces, while centralizing testing equipment and
professionals at technical platforms, we are able to reduce equipment and personnel overhead
costs associated with carrying out testing at each collection center. We currently have around
270 collection centers in France served by eleven regional clusters comprising 24 technical
platforms, 20 collection centers in Belgium served by two technical platforms and 70 collection
centers in Luxembourg served by one technical platform. Our operating model also enables us to
automate the testing process and report results quickly and efficiently. We perform and report
the results of most routine procedures within 12 hours of the collection of the sample, utilizing a
variety of sophisticated and computerized laboratory testing instruments at each of our technical
platforms.

Testing is generally organized into three phases: (i) the pre-analytical phase, which includes
collecting samples and delivering them to testing facilities; (ii) the analytical phase, during which
the actual test is performed; and (iii) the post analytical phase, where results are delivered to the
prescribing doctor and the patient and interpretation assistance is offered by our clinical
pathologists.

121


-----

_Pre-analytical phase._ Before clinical testing is performed, samples are collected from the
patient, identified and delivered to our laboratories. In France and Luxembourg, patient samples
are collected directly by the laboratory, although in more remote areas, samples are collected by
nurses who then submit samples to the laboratory. In Belgium, samples are primarily collected at
doctors’ offices and transported to our laboratories for testing.

_Analytical phase._ Once we have logged in the test request and collected the samples, we
perform the necessary tests. Most of our routine tests are automated, while others must be
performed manually by our clinical pathologists or technicians.

_Post analytical phase._ Our clinical pathologists interpret test results once they become available.
Routine testing is typically completed within less than 12 hours. Results are transmitted either in
hard copy or made available electronically to patients or doctors via a server.

_Our Routine Lab Customers_

Customers of our Routine Lab business are individual patients who require routine clinical tests in
connection with the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of different illnesses. Generally,
doctors prescribe the relevant tests to their patients who then go to one of our collection
centers. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed routine tests for approximately
10.5 million patients across all the markets where we operate.

_Our Routine Lab Operations_
_France_

We believe we were the largest private network of clinical pathology laboratories in France in
terms of run-rate revenue and one of the two national scale networks. We operate eleven
regional clusters with approximately 270 collection centers:

- Cerballiance Paris, in Paris;

- Cerballiance Paris Sud, Cerballiance Paris Ouest and Cerballiance Paris Nord, in the Paris area;

- Cerballiance Hauts-de-France, in the Lille area;

- Cerballiance Provence and Cerballiance Côte d’Azur, in southeastern France;

- Cerballiance Pyrénées and Cerballiance Midi-Pyrénées, in southwestern France;

- Cerballiance Côte d’Armor and Cerballiance Finistère, in the Brittany area;

- Cerballiance Réunion, in the overseas French département of Réunion;

- Cerballiance Picardie, in the Amiens area;

- Cerballiance Rhône-Alpes, Cerballiance Loire and Cerballiance Bourgogne, in the Lyon Area;

- Cerballiance Normandie, in the Normandie area; and

- Cerballiance Charentes, in the Charente and Charente-Maritime region.

We believe that, for the French market in particular, location plays a key role in a clinical
laboratory’s success. Medical doctors in France are prohibited by law from administering
laboratory analyses themselves. As a result, patients are prescribed medical analyses and find a
walk-in laboratory or arrange for a nurse or technician to collect a sample from their home.
Patients who travel to a laboratory to have their sample taken typically choose a laboratory
based on proximity to their home or workplace. We have consequently focused on making

122


-----

selective acquisitions targeted at increasing the density of our footprint in France in order to
build a leading position in the French routine laboratory testing market. In 2016, we have rebranded our entire network of laboratories in France under the brand Cerballiance.

Each of our collection centers in France has an on-site clinical pathologist as required by law.
Samples collected are then sent on to the nearest regional technical platform for testing. We
processed approximately 9.4 million files in France in the year ended December 31, 2016, or over
30,000 per day.

Our Routine Lab business in France generated €385.8 million of net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2016, representing 60.8% of our total Routine Lab net sales for the same period.

_Belgium and Luxembourg_

We have been active in the Belgian routine laboratory testing market since our acquisition of
BARC in 2007. We believe that we are among the three largest private routine laboratories in
Belgium in terms of revenue, based on management estimates for 2016, performing analyses for
public and private hospitals, doctors and patients.

As of December 31, 2016, we operated in Belgium through two regional clusters:

- CRI, the largest private laboratory in the Ghent area with sites throughout a large part of
Flanders; and

- LBS, the largest private laboratory in the Brussels area.

Our laboratories in Belgium offer a broad range of routine tests. Our samples are collected at the
collection centers that we operate or are collected at doctors’ offices and sent to our laboratories
for testing. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed routine tests for approximately
700,000 patients in Belgium, or over 2,200 per day. We believe that we are the largest private
routine ambulatory care laboratory in Luxembourg, with a market share of approximately 60% in
2016. Our routine laboratory testing business in Luxembourg is operated through Ketterthill
Laboratories, which we acquired through our acquisition of LLAM in 2011. We have one technical
platform with 70 collection centers throughout Luxembourg, through which we offer a broad
range of routine tests. In 2016, we performed routine tests for approximately 400,000 patients in
Luxembourg, or over 1,200 per day.

Our Routine Lab business in Belgium and in Luxembourg generated collectively €70.7 million of
net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing 11.2% of our total Routine Lab net
sales for the same period.

_Routine Lab Growth through Acquisitions_

Both strategic and bolt-on acquisitions have played a key role in the development of our Routine
Lab business, and we expect acquisitions to continue to be an important part of our growth
strategy in the future. Before December 31, 2008, our business consisted of our Specialized
Testing business unit, our Central Lab business unit, as well as our Routine Lab business in
Belgium. We have accomplished our Routine Lab growth through the strategic acquisition of
regional clusters, beginning with our acquisition of Cerballiance Hauts-de-France (formerly
Biolille) in 2009. We have augmented this development through bolt-on acquisitions of small
laboratories that we are able to use as collection centers to increase our concentration in
targeted market areas. Over the past three years, we have completed 15 separate acquisition
transactions, of which four were large, strategic acquisitions, mainly consisting of acquisitions of
routine laboratories in France and, in 2016, we acquired a majority stake in Menalabs to develop
our Routine Lab presences in the United Arab Emirates. We believe that we are among the five
largest private routine laboratories in the United Arab Emirates in terms of revenue.

123


-----

We have a two phase investment analysis process. Target selection begins with our dedicated
acquisition team of five professionals, including our chief executive officer, applying specified
criteria to identify an attractive laboratory for acquisition. After evaluating the opportunity for
synergies and market conditions in the target’s region and determining a valuation estimate, the
acquisition team presents its findings to an ad hoc Investment Committee organized to review
the acquisition that is typically composed of our CEO, deputy CEO, CFO and a member of our
business development team. Acquisitions with an estimated value greater than €5 million are
also presented to an ad hoc Executive Committee comprised of our CEO, deputy CEO, CFO and a
representative of our majority shareholder for review. The committee reviewing the proposed
transaction, upon consideration of the potential target’s key financial information and the
business rationale for the transaction, decides whether or not to proceed with the next phase. A
favorable decision launches phase two, which entails a more thorough vetting of the target,
including legal, financial and technical due diligence, determination of the appropriate structure
for the transaction and negotiation of an acquisition agreement. Our business development
manager, representatives of our finance department and the head of our routine laboratory
testing business unit are all involved heavily in this phase. Upon completion of this phase, the
transaction is once again presented to our Investment Committee (and to our Executive
Committee for acquisitions above €5 million). Their favorable decision then results in the plan of
acquisition being presented to our full board of directors for approval.

Once an acquisition agreement has been signed, our management liaises with clinical
pathologists at the target laboratory to begin the integration process. A team of 20 professionals
from our finance, quality control, purchasing, information technology, human resources, legal
and engineering teams work in concert to begin harmonizing procedures in order to be in a
position to rapidly integrate the laboratory after closing. Approximately six months after closing,
management conducts a post-acquisition review during which it tracks the progress made on the
plan put in place by the integration team and the performance of the newly acquired laboratory
in the context of our group level business plan.

**_Specialized Testing_**

_Overview_

Our Specialized Testing business is our historical core business and today our second largest line
of business. Our Specialized Testing business generated €179.3 million of net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2016, representing 28.3% of our total net sales for the same period. In
France, we are the co-leader in specialized laboratory testing in terms of revenue based on
management estimates for 2016, with our main competitor Biomnis (Eurofins).

We perform all our specialized testing at our laboratory in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France, but
collect samples for testing from over 3,000 collection centers throughout France (including
collection centers that we own and operate through our Routine Lab business as well as third
party routine laboratories), elsewhere in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. We derived
91.9% of our Specialized Testing net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, from samples
collected in France. We do not outsource any of our specialized testing to other laboratories.

Similar to our Routine Lab business, our Specialized Testing business is highly regulated,
including in terms of price for our services in certain jurisdictions. Specialized Testing business
includes primarily reimbursed, price regulated tests, as well as innovative specialized tests with
no applicable price regulation. See “Industry—Clinical Pathology Testing—Market Overview” and
“Regulation—Regulations Affecting our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing Businesses.”

_Our Specialized Testing Services_

Our Specialized Testing business involves a more complex level of clinical laboratory tests than
those provided through our Routine Lab business. These tests are conducted by highly skilled
laboratory professionals and often require more sophisticated technology, equipment and
materials.

124


-----

Our Specialized Testing services consist of performing specialized tests on behalf of our Routine
Lab business as well as those that are outsourced by other private laboratories and hospitals that
do not have the scale, the expertise or the willingness to perform such tests, particularly due to
the equipment needed for such testing and the lower demand for such testing compared to
routine testing. Specialized testing also requires a high level of scientific and medical expertise,
which we have developed since Cerba was established in 1967. Private laboratories, private
hospitals and public hospitals (including most public hospitals in France) outsource their
specialized tests to specialty private laboratories such as us.

_Our Specialized Testing Customers_

Our Specialized Testing client base includes doctors from whom we directly receive samples
(primarily in Belgium), public and private hospitals, as well as other clinical laboratories that
choose to outsource their specialized testing.

We reach clients throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa who choose to send their
samples to our specialized testing facility in France.

Of our Specialized Testing net sales as of December 31, 2016, 31.3% was attributable to public
hospitals and other public institutions and 68.7% was attributable to the private sector (private
hospitals and/or laboratories and/or ambulatory patients).

_Our Specialized Testing Logistics_

Maintaining an efficient collection and transportation network is key to operating our
Specialized Testing business. We collect samples for testing throughout France, the rest of
Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. These samples are delivered at the same time on a
daily basis to our testing facility in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France, so that the results are delivered
to clients within 24 hours of collection. In the past, we owned and operated a transportation
fleet in order to collect and deliver Specialized Testing samples to our facility. However, to
optimize costs, we have outsourced our specialized testing sample transportation services since
1998. We believe this is a more efficient use of our resources, as it avoids the need for us to incur
capital expenditures on equipment necessary for such logistics, such as a fleet of vehicles, and
eliminates the fixed costs associated with directly employing logistics staff. In addition, the
accreditation requirements with respect to long distance transportation of medical samples have
become more stringent. As such, we feel confident about outsourcing our transportation to a
partner that specializes in this field. Nevertheless, we maintain strict control over the operations
of our logistics network. We employ a dedicated team in charge of managing our logistics
provider to ensure that our logistics provider meets our strict quality standards, including our
24 hour turnaround time from sample collection to test result delivery. This team sets routes for
the collection of samples and optimizes delivery times to our testing facility to allow for batches
of similar tests to be run at once in order to maximize the efficient use of our equipment and
clinical pathologists’ time. We review our outsourcing arrangements on a regular basis and
choose providers through formal tender procedures. In addition, we have the contractual right to
take direct control over our provider’s dedicated vehicles and logistics personnel in the event of a
material problem with the services.

_Our Specialized Testing Operations_

Our Specialized Testing business is structured into three groups: clinical pathology, anatomical
pathology and cytogenetics. We perform approximately 32,000 tests on over 24,000 samples per
day through our Specialized Testing business. Through our clinical pathology group alone, we are
able to perform approximately 2,500 different specialized clinical pathology tests (one of the
largest such offerings in Europe), including:

- screening for genetic disorders such as Down Syndrome;

125


-----

- immunology (the study of the immune system, including allergies, transplant compatibility,
antibodies, cytokines, immune system cells and their effect, receptor systems and autoimmune
diseases);

- virology tests (such as determining a patient’s viral load in order to determine the effectiveness
of an antiviral regimen);

- bacteriology (the study of infectious bacteria);

- hormonology (the study of hormone secretions and their effects on body growth and
metabolism); and

- oncology (the study of abnormal cell growth, including benign tumors and cancer).

The clinical pathology group performs approximately 32,000 tests per day from a catalog of
approximately 2,500 tests. It accounted for approximately 90% of our Specialized Testing net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our clinical pathology group performed
approximately 10 million tests during the year ended December 31, 2016. A medical team
including approximately 20 clinical pathologists provides support to routine clinical pathologists
and doctors for interpreting the results of the specialized clinical pathology tests we perform.

Our anatomical pathology group performs testing of histologic or cytological samples, mostly for
oncology diagnostic testing purposes. Our offerings in this area range from skin tests and cervical
smears to fetal testing. Our anatomical pathology group performs approximately 1,600 tests per
day and accounted for approximately 6% of our total Specialized Testing net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2016. We have a dedicated team of approximately 40 professionals. Our
cytogenetics group performs, among other things, pre- and post-natal genetic screenings, genetic
testing related to cancer and blood diseases as well as general genetic level testing support for
our other groups. The cytogenetics group accounts for approximately 4% of all our Specialized
Testing net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. We have a team of four genetics
specialists and approximately 55 specialized technicians dedicated to the operations of this
group.

**_Central Lab_**

_Overview_

Our Central Lab business is our third line of business and generated €25.0 million of net sales for
the year ended December 31, 2016, representing 3.9% of our total net sales for the same period.

We provide central laboratory testing services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
and contract research organizations (CROs) in connection with the clinical trial phase of their
drug development processes. In 2015, the central laboratory testing market was estimated by a
major third party consulting firm to be worth over $2.8 billion worldwide. We operate our
Central Lab business through BARC, which we acquired in 2007. BARC has been engaged in the
central laboratory testing business since its creation in 1985. We believe we are a significant
player in the Central Lab market worldwide based on management estimates for 2016. New
drugs generally go through three phases of clinical testing before being marketed to the general
public for use, potentially followed by an additional phase of post-marketing surveillance. We
provide testing to support the development of new pharmaceuticals generally through Phases II
through III of a drug’s development. A large proportion of our Central Lab business is derived
from Phase II clinical testing. For a description of the phases of clinical testing for
pharmaceuticals, see “Industry—Market Trends—Central Lab.”

126


-----

_Our Central Lab Services_

As a reference laboratory for pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations, we
provide clinical trial assistance by running routine and specialized tests on samples received from
patients in such trials. We provide five general types of services:

- collaboration with clients to develop new tests and define appropriate test panels;

- drug safety testing through hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis;

- drug efficacy testing through laboratory testing of surrogate endpoints (that is, biomarkers
that are indicators of a desired clinical effect);

- pharmacodynamics testing, which measures the effects of a drug on the body; and

- the recording and storing of tests and results that can be used in connection with future
testing.

_Our Central Lab Customers_

We work for research and development (“R&D”) groups at major drug and pharmaceutical
companies to develop tests to demonstrate a compound’s medical usefulness. We also work for
contract research organizations such as Onyx Scientific, to focus on the testing piece of a
pharmaceutical company’s wide scale R&D efforts. Most of our central laboratory testing business
is conducted pursuant to contracts with pharmaceutical companies. As of December 31, 2016, our
top five customers in terms of net sales collectively accounted for 36.6% of our Central Lab net
sales. No single customer represented more than 11% of the sales of our Central Lab business for
the year ending December 31, 2016.

In general, our Central Lab customer contracts are linked to a particular clinical trial and last for
the duration of the phase of the trial drug’s development. Contracts fix the fees that we charge
for our services over the length of the clinical trial. We do not enter into exclusivity contracts for
clinical testing with any of our Central Lab customers. Contracts for Central Lab customers vary in
duration from six to 60 months, depending on the length of the particular clinical trial for which
our services are needed. Pricing is determined on a per test basis and is generally fixed, although
customers are sometimes offered rebates based on the achievement of specified volumes of
testing. Contracts estimate the volume of tests that will be required, although this is non-binding
and does not represent a commitment to order a specific volume of tests. We are subject to
liability if we fail to perform tests in a timely manner. However, we maintain insurance for any
such potential claims and generally our liability under our Central Lab contracts is limited. Since
regulatory authorities receive reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing, they may
require the modification, suspension or termination of clinical trials if they conclude that an
unwarranted risk is presented to patients or healthy volunteers. Contracts may be terminated at
any time at will by Central Lab customers, without indemnification. In the event that a customer
cancels or terminates a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services
performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent customer authorized services related to
terminating the cancelled project.

_Our Central Lab Operations_

For trials that are based in Europe and South Africa, we perform tests related to our Central Lab
business through our routine and specialized facilities and technical platforms in France, Belgium
and Luxembourg. Additionally, we have logistics and administrative facilities in each of the
United States, Australia and Singapore, where we work with local laboratories to perform our
central lab tests. Finally, we have local partners in China and Japan through which we conduct
our entire Central Lab business in these countries.

127


-----

We are one of the few market participants with both a routine laboratory testing business and a
central laboratory testing business. We leverage this distinguishing characteristic in several ways.
First, we are able to use the lab network and infrastructure that we already have for our Routine
Lab and Specialized Testing businesses for our Central Lab business. This provides us cost savings
that we would not necessarily have had if our Central Lab business was our sole line of business.
We are able to pass on such cost savings to customers and provide Central Lab services at a
competitive price. Further, potential Central Lab clients view the expertise that we have
developed in the day to day operations of our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses as
a sign that we are familiar with the latest testing technology and are capable of effectively
carrying out testing on a large scale.

#### Quality Standards

Our different lines of business are generally highly regulated in terms of standard of quality and
conduct of our tests. Our quality assurance efforts mainly focus on correct patient identification
of samples, reporting accuracy, proficiency testing, reference range relevance, process audits,
statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and collection centers.
We also focus on the proper licensing, credentials and training of our professional and technical
staff.

Our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses are subject to national level regulation that
sets quality standards for our operations. These standards vary across jurisdictions. See
“Regulation.” We believe we are in compliance with applicable accreditation or certification
standards of standard setting bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization
(“ISO”), Comité français d’accréditation (“COFRAC”) in France and BELAC in Belgium. In addition,
our central laboratory business is exposed to regulatory constraints on test protocols and
laboratory upkeep imposed on the pharmaceutical industry. We often agree in contracts with our
clients to meet specific regulatory requirements on our central laboratory testing operations that
would not have otherwise applied directly to us for commercial reasons. For more detail on the
regulatory standards to which our operations are subject, see “Regulation.”

We seek to assure the highest level of quality control throughout our Group. We have a group
level Quality Committee that oversees our several business units. We also have dedicated quality
assurance staff for each of our lines of business: our Routine Lab business (including separate
quality assurance teams for our French Routine Lab business and our Belgium and Luxembourg
Routine Lab businesses), our Specialized Testing business and our Central Lab testing business.
Our facilities are subject to periodic external reviews for quality assurance. For example, our
French Routine Lab and Specialized Testing facilities are subject to inspection by COFRAC every
18 months. Further, our Belgian Routine Lab facilities are subject to review and inspection for
adherence to BELAC norms on a periodic basis. Our Central Lab business is subject to periodic
review by our clients to ensure that we are meeting the standards to which we agreed in our
contracts. Such reviews occur at least once during each clinical trial we perform. Finally, we have
a dedicated quality control team that monitors our relationship with our outsourced logistics
provider and have put in place contingency measures in the event of the provider’s material
breach of our outsourcing agreement.

#### Our Suppliers

The primary equipment and material required to conduct our business are testing equipment and
reagents. We regularly evaluate the equipment (analytical systems and robotic, pre- and postanalytical devices) used by our business. We own the majority of the equipment necessary to
conduct our Routine Lab, Specialized Testing and Central Lab businesses. We finance equipment
acquisitions in the ordinary course of business through loans secured by the equipment being
financed.

128


-----

In addition to testing equipment, we also use basic materials such as reagents in our business. We
do not enter into exclusivity contracts with any single supplier. However, our dedicated buying
team crafts framework agreements pursuant to which suppliers are able to compete for the
opportunity to supply our technical platforms with needed chemicals. No single provider is the
source of more than 15% of our supplies for any particular calendar year.

#### Billing and Payment

Billing for our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses is a complex process involving
several payers. Depending on the billing arrangement and the applicable law of the country in
which we operate, the payer may be a third party responsible for providing health insurance
coverage to patients (such as national public health insurance or a private medical insurance
plan), a patient or other party (such as a hospital, another laboratory or an employer) who
outsourced testing to us, or a combination of these parties.

We generally bill for clinical testing services on a fee for service basis. In each of the countries in
which we operate our Routine Lab testing business, the rates we can legally charge for routine
laboratory tests are set by regulators. According to “Comptes nationaux de la santé 2015”
published by DREES, in 2015, approximately 70% of spending in the French medical laboratory
testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered
by private insurance companies (approximately 25%) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket
(approximately 3%).

In Belgium, the social security system reimburses approximately 75% of the tests performed by
clinical biology laboratories, with patients responsible for the remainder. Belgian regulations also
permit laboratories to charge patients a nominal administrative fee on a per patient basis. In
Luxembourg, the entire cost of tests included in the national regulator’s catalog is paid for by the
national healthcare system. Routine tests are almost invariably subject to price controls and
reimbursement from the government.

In France, Belgium and Luxembourg, our Routine Lab patients pay the portion of the fee for
which they are responsible (if any) at the time of service and the remainder is paid to us by the
third party payer (national social security and/or private supplementary health insurance)
generally within 30 days. However, if a routine test is administered in a non-therapeutic context
(that is, if a patient is receiving elective medical treatment), that test would generally not be
covered by government health insurance and the patient would be responsible for the entire cost
of the test.

We have historically billed for our Specialized Testing business in much the same way as routine
testing in France. However, new regulations in France in 2012 required that we invoice a routine
laboratory that outsourced a test to our Specialized Testing business instead of invoicing patients
directly. Prices for specialized tests are generally set by the government, but certain specialized
tests that we provide are not on the French government catalog and therefore do not have a set
fee. In such instances, we are free to set our fees on our own according to market forces. Further,
tests done on samples imported from outside countries are not subject to fee restrictions. For
such “export” tests, we generally set our fees taking into account the regulatory fee for the test
in the exporting country, if any. Payments to us by national social security and/or private
supplementary health insurance in the Specialized Testing business are generally made within
approximately 60 days after testing. Payments by public entities, such as hospitals, take longer,
running up to 80 days.

Our Central Lab business operates on a traditional contractual model through which we set rates
directly with our clients. We are generally paid promptly for our services by our Central Lab
clients.

129


-----

Although we believe we have no material issues related to collecting fees for our services, we are
subject to the risk of non-payment by patients and other clients. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Business—Financial difficulties of certain of our clients or third party payers may require_
_us to write off debts.” We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts and amounts past due._

#### Environmental, Health and Safety

Our operations are subject to licensing and other requirements under EU, national and local laws
and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human and occupational
health and safety, including those requirements governing the handling, transportation and
disposal of medical samples and biological, infectious and hazardous waste. All our laboratories
are subject to requirements for the disposal of laboratory samples at authorized facilities and we
generally utilize outside vendors for the disposal of such samples. Nevertheless, we could be held
responsible for cleanup of contamination at such sites attributable to our wastes.

In addition, we must meet extensive requirements relating to workplace safety in clinical
laboratories, particularly for employees who could be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as
HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice
controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other
measures designed to minimize exposure to, and the transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.

Although we are not aware of any current material non-compliance with our obligations under
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in connection with our operations, failure
to comply with such laws and regulations in the future could subject us to civil and criminal fines
and penalties, remediation costs, enforcement actions, the suspension or termination of our
licenses to operate or third party claims. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We
_are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may_
_face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be negatively impacted if we_
_fail to comply.”_

#### Information Technology Systems

We use information technology systems (or “IT systems”) in virtually all aspects of our business,
including clinical laboratory testing, central laboratory testing, billing, customer service and the
management of medical data. We also use our and internal reporting system in order to monitor
key performance indicators in each of our laboratories and adjust our operations accordingly.
The successful delivery of our services depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted
performance of our IT systems, especially when time is of the essence for a laboratory test result.

Historically, we have grown through acquisitions and as a consequence newly acquired
laboratories may not use software platforms that are consistent with the systems we have
implemented on a group wide basis. Newly acquired laboratories may continue to use their
existing IT systems for an indefinite amount of time after their acquisition, although we
encourage them to adopt one of two pre-approved IT platforms when they consider changing
their systems.

#### Facilities

Our facilities consist primarily of collection centers, technical platforms, our specialized
laboratory facility in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France, and office space. We rent the majority of our
premises pursuant to commercial leases. We believe that our facilities are generally adequate for
our present needs and that suitable additional or replacement space would be available to the
extent required.

130


-----

#### Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,396 full-time equivalent employees and we
employed approximately 415 clinical pathologists. In France and Belgium, we are subject to
collective bargaining agreements negotiated between unions and employers’ representatives at
the national level and made mandatory pursuant to national labor law. Although we are subject
from time to time to minor employment related disputes, we believe that overall our relations
with our employees are good.

#### Intellectual Property

Generally, we do not regard intellectual property to be a material part of our assets or essential
to our operations. Besides copyright protections on our business and trade names, we do not
hold any material intellectual property assets.

#### Insurance

We maintain insurance, both on the Group level and on the level of each of our individual
laboratories, against various risks related to our business, including mandatory professional civil
liability (for which amendments are made from time to time for laboratories conducting specific
activities within the scope of our business, such as tests related to fertility treatments or prenatal
diagnosis), combined property damage and, in respect of certain of our laboratories, business
interruption policies. We have taken out directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for executives
within our Group. We also maintain applicable compulsory workers’ compensation and motor
liability coverage.

We believe that our existing insurance policies are adequate in terms of both amounts covered
and conditions of coverage to cover the major risks of our business, taking into account the cost
of insurance coverage and the potential risks to business operations. However, there can be no
assurance that no losses will be incurred or that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the cost
of defense or damages in the event of a significant claim. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance.”_

#### Legal Proceedings

We have been involved, and may be involved in the future, in various legal proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business, including disputes concerning professional liability and employee
related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and health insurance carriers
regarding, among other things, billing issues. Because we operate in a regulated industry, we
are, in the ordinary course of business, subject to national and local regulatory scrutiny,
supervision and controls. For more information on the regulations governing our business, see
“Regulation.”

In addition, the Syndicat des Jeunes Biologistes Médicaux (SJBM), a trade union representing
certain young biologists in France, announced that it may initiate legal proceedings against us,
alleging that the competent French regulators should not approve two upcoming mergers within
our network because those would, in SJBM’s view, not be permitted by the French law dated
May 30, 2013. Such law requires that the ownership of more than 50% of the share capital and
voting rights of laboratory companies be held, directly or indirectly, by clinical pathologists
working within such laboratory companies, with such requirement subject to certain
grandfathering provisions applying to laboratory companies acquired under a prior regulatory
system. To our knowledge, no such legal proceedings have been initiated to date. We firmly
believe that all the Group’s laboratories have been acquired, and are held, in full compliance
with the French laws and regulations (including applicable grandfathering provisions) and have
obtained legal advice to this effect. In addition, the legal structure of ownership of all our

131


-----

laboratories has been validated by, and each of our laboratories has received a licence to operate
from, the competent French regional regulators (ARS). We will vigorously defend ourselves
against these allegations and believe them to be without merit. For more information on
laboratory ownership requirements in France, see “Regulation—Regulations Affecting our
_Routine Lab and Specialized Testing Businesses—France—Laboratory Ownership and Corporate_
_Structure.”_

On January 13, 2014, Mr. Jean Luc Dourson and Biopart (a company wholly owned by
Mr. Dourson) initiated proceedings against us before the Paris Commercial Court (tribunal de
_commerce de Paris). The complainants are seeking rescission of the relevant contracts of sale of_
LLAM (owner of Luxembourg based Ketterthill laboratory) which we acquired on June 6, 2011.
The complainants argue that we did not fulfil our obligations under the contracts of sale and
that rescission may be granted pursuant to Article 1184 of the French Civil Code. The Paris
Commercial Court ruled against Mr. Dourson and Biopart but they filed an appeal on
November 7, 2016. We continue to vigorously defend the allegations and believe them to be
without merit. Consequently we have not made any provision on our balance sheet for this
litigation proceeding.

132


-----

# Regulation

We are subject to extensive government regulation in each of the countries in which we operate
across our lines of business. Regulations that pertain to operating requirements, professional
qualifications of laboratory personnel, constraints on the ownership of clinical laboratories
(which are especially strict in France), and pricing and reimbursement levels of clinical laboratory
tests affect our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses. In addition, our Central Lab
business is subject to further regulations that particularly concern drug safety.

We are also affected by numerous other laws and regulations that impose restrictions and
requirements on the handling and storing of certain chemicals and reagents as well as the
disposal of biological refuse, govern the handling and storing of personal data and aim to
prevent fraud to social security systems.

#### Regulations Affecting Our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing Businesses

The activities we undertake as part of our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations are
regulated on the national level in each of the three main countries in which we operate.

**_France_**

_Pricing and Reimbursement_

With respect to pricing and reimbursement, clinical laboratories are bound by the prices set by
the Ministry of Health and the National Health Insurance Fund (Caisse Nationale d’Assurance
_Maladie). Prices are revised annually through negotiations among the Ministry of Health, the_
National Health Insurance Fund and clinical pathologists’ labor unions. Over the past three years,
tariffs for clinical laboratory testing have decreased by approximately €100 million per year. We
expect further downward pressure on tariffs in France going forward as the government
endeavors to further reduce the rate of growth of national healthcare expenditures, although
we are unable to be certain of the extent of any future reductions.

According to “Les dépenses de santé en 2015—Résultats des comptes de la santé,” in 2015,
approximately 70% of spending in the French private clinical pathology testing market was
financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private insurance
companies (approximately 25%) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately 3%).
This split has not materially changed in recent years.

The reimbursement of tests by the French National Health Insurance is subject to an agreement
with the National Health Insurance Fund, which must be entered into by clinical laboratories and
each of the pathologists practicing within the laboratory. Any failure of one of the pathologists
or of the laboratory to comply with the terms of the aforementioned agreement may lead to the
suspension of reimbursement by the National Health Insurance Fund (déconventionnement).

_Quality and Accreditation Standards_

French law requires an administrative authorization (autorisation administrative) for the
establishment and operation of clinical laboratories. As part of the authorization process, local
health authorities review a filing detailing the laboratory’s corporate form and governance,
premises, equipment, tests, and operating procedures, as well as the professional qualifications
of the laboratory’s personnel, including clinical pathologists. The law sets minimal standards to
be met in each of these areas. A laboratory must inform local health authorities of changes
affecting any of the above matters.

Pursuant to an ordinance dated January 13, 2010 (ordonnance n° 2010-49 relative à la biologie
_médicale), which was ratified by law n° 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 related to the reform of_
medical biology, the existing administrative authorization process will be replaced after

133


-----

November 1, 2020 (with two intermediary steps in 2016 and 2018, concerning respectively 50%
and 70% of the tests performed by a laboratory) by a new accreditation procedure to be carried
out by a national accreditation body (the Comité français d’accréditation, or “COFRAC”). The
accreditation procedure introduces new, stricter requirements for clinical laboratories pursuant
to standards promulgated by the ISO (namely, ISO 15189). The ordinance provides for a
transitional regime, whereby:

- until November 1, 2020, a non-accredited clinical laboratory may operate on the basis of its
administrative authorization, and remains subject to the regulatory requirements described
above relating to, notably, premises, equipment and mandatory minimums on the number of
clinical pathologists. However, the administrative authorization will be withdrawn if by
November 1, 2016, the laboratory has not been accredited for 50% of the tests it performs or
if, by November 1, 2018, the laboratory has not been accredited for 70% of the tests it
performs, and if, by November 1, 2020, the laboratory has not been accredited for 100% of the
tests it performs; and

- since November 1, 2013, a non-accredited clinical laboratory is required to demonstrate that it
has effectively begun the new accreditation process.

The COFRAC may suspend or revoke a laboratory’s accreditation for all or part of the laboratory’s
business if such laboratory fails to comply with the requisite health, safety and quality standards.
Furthermore, French law provides for substantial fines and penalties if the regulatory
requirements for the grant of administrative authorizations and/or accreditation are breached.

There is no limit under French law as to the number of branch offices that a laboratory
incorporated as a company may operate. However, a laboratory company may not open branch
offices in more than three contiguous regional zones (territoires de santé) and for each branch
office, at least one clinical pathologist shall be appointed to enable a speedy medical support to
each branch office (meaning that a laboratory company must have at least as many clinical
pathologists as branch offices). Furthermore, regional health authorities (agences régionales de
_santé) may further deny authorization for new clinical laboratories (or new branch offices of_
existing laboratories) within a given geographic area as delimited by each regional health authority
(zone déterminée en application du b du 2° de l’article L. 1434-9 du Code de la santé publique) if
the proposed laboratory’s testing operations would cause the offer of testing operations to exceed
by 25% the relevant zone’s testing needs. Health authorities may also veto acquisitions of
laboratory companies or branch offices, or mergers of laboratory companies if the share of the
tests performed by the consolidated laboratory would exceed 25% of the total number of tests
performed in the relevant zone. Furthermore, the acquisition of shares of a laboratory company is
prohibited if such acquisition would result in the acquiror controlling, directly or indirectly, the
performance of more than 33% of the tests performed in the relevant zone.

French law also limits the number of tests that can be outsourced by a clinical laboratory to other
laboratories every year to 15% of the total number of tests it conducts. This limitation does not
apply to the outsourcing of tests between branch offices of a single clinical laboratory company.
The outsourcing of tests is monitored by the regional health authorities and the absence of
representation or misrepresentation concerning outsourced activities may give rise to
administrative sanctions.

_Professional Licensing and Ethics_

Clinical pathologists, technicians and laboratory personnel collecting patient samples must meet
certain minimum professional qualifications.

In France, each clinical laboratory must be supervised during business hours by at least one
clinical pathologist who acts as the legal representative of the laboratory company and is
responsible for its operations, including the processing of tests outsourced to other laboratories.

134


-----

Clinical pathologists must be registered with the pharmacists’ professional association (Ordre des
_Pharmaciens) or the medical doctors’ professional association (Ordre des Médecins, together, the_
“Ordres”), depending on whether they are qualified as pharmacists or medical doctors. Through
their membership in an Ordre, clinical pathologists working in clinical laboratories are subject to
the same rules of professional conduct as medical doctors and pharmacists set by the relevant
_Ordre. Laboratory companies must also be registered with one or both Ordres, based on the_
professional affiliation of the clinical pathologists practicing within such laboratories.

The Ordre des Pharmaciens and the Ordre des Médecins are self-regulatory bodies with
administrative and disciplinary powers over practicing professionals. They also represent,
respectively, the collective interests of pharmacists and medical doctors (including in both cases,
clinical pathologists) before French public authorities and may be called upon to issue opinions
(avis) on certain issues involving their profession, including proposed laws and regulations. The
_Ordres also monitor compliance by practicing professionals with applicable laws and regulations._

Among the professional conduct rules enforced by the Ordre des Pharmaciens is the principle of
independence defined in Article R.4235-18 of the French Public Health Code. Pursuant to this
principle, a pharmacist may not be subject to any financial, commercial, technical or moral
constraint, if such constraint could impair his or her professional independence. A similar
provision affecting medical doctors, Article R.4127-5 of the French Public Health Code, provides
that a medical doctor cannot, in any manner or form, compromise his or her professional
independence.

The Ordre des Pharmaciens and the Ordre des Médecins regulate access to the profession by
maintaining respective national registries of practicing professionals (each, a Tableau de l’Ordre),
on which every practicing pharmacist or medical doctor, as well as every clinical laboratory
company, must be registered. New clinical laboratories, including entities formed by the merger
of preexisting laboratories, must apply for registration on the relevant Tableau de l’Ordre as a
prerequisite to obtaining administrative authorization. An Ordre may withhold or suspend
registration due to violation of the relevant professional conduct rules.

Clinical laboratories are subject to ongoing regulatory supervision by each of the Ordres and, as a
consequence, must submit to the relevant Ordre for review any proposed change in their capital
ownership or articles of association, any cooperation contracts entered into with other clinical
laboratories and, more generally, any agreements relating to their operations or governing the
relations between their shareholders. Upon its review, the Ordre may inform regional health
authorities of any perceived regulatory violations. The regional health authorities are not bound
by the findings of the relevant Ordre in this respect. As part of its disciplinary powers, each
professional association may impose disciplinary sanctions on clinical pathologists, including the
temporary or permanent suspension of practicing professionals who have breached professional
conduct rules.

It is worth mentioning that, following a complaint lodged by Labco, it has recently been found
by the General Court of the European Union that the Ordre des Pharmaciens had restricted
competition on the clinical biology analysis market by adopting a restrictive interpretation of
French regulations in order to prevent groups of laboratories from developing in France
(Judgment of 10th December 2014, Case T-90/11, Ordre national des pharmaciens and Others v
_Commission). This decision has been appealed by the Ordre des Pharmaciens._

Regional health authorities in France monitor compliance by clinical laboratories with health and
safety regulations through on-site inspections. In addition, certain tests or categories of tests are
controlled by specialized agencies as part of a yearly quality control program. Regional health
authorities may impose administrative sanctions on clinical laboratories and, in certain instances,
clinical pathologists, for violations of certain regulatory requirements, including health, safety
and quality regulations. These sanctions range from fines to the temporary or permanent closing
of the laboratory, in the case of particularly serious or repeated violations.

135


-----

Certain illegal activities, including the illegal practice of clinical biology (exercice illégal des
_fonctions de biologiste médical) and the misleading use of the title of clinical pathologist by a_
person without the legal right to do so (usage sans droit de la qualité de biologiste medical),
carry criminal penalties that range from the prohibition to practice clinical biology or operate a
clinical laboratory to imprisonment for individuals.

In addition, clinical laboratories may not advertise their services, directly or indirectly, to the
general public. Certain information provided to medical doctors is, however, excluded from this
prohibition, notably information of a medical or scientific nature, and upon opening of a new
laboratory, the public announcement of the laboratory’s existence, location, and test offerings.

_Laboratory Ownership and Corporate Structure_

French law also contains specific provisions dealing with the corporate form through which a
clinical laboratory can be operated and imposes limitations on who can hold the capital stock and
exercise the voting rights within such corporations. These provisions and limitations reflect the
traditional view in France that clinical laboratories are engaged in medical activity conducted
through small, privately owned entities by independent professionals (profession libérale).

Owners of a clinical laboratory who do not want to operate their laboratory directly can
incorporate their business through a non-profit organization, a société civile professionnelle
(SCP) or a cooperative undertaking or société d’exercice libéral (SEL). SELs can take several forms:
_société d’exercice libéral à responsabilité limitée (SELARL), société d’exercice libéral à forme_
_anonyme (SELAFA), société d’exercice libéral en commandite par actions (SELCA) or société_
_d’exercice libéral par actions simplifiée (SELAS). Another specific corporate form is the société de_
_participations financières de professions libérales (SPFPL), which cannot directly operate a clinical_
laboratory but may serve as a holding company for SELs. All our French clinical laboratories are
incorporated as SELAFA or SELAS.

The following principles apply to SELs in general:

- a clinical pathologist can only act as a responsible clinical pathologist for, and therefore
manage, one SEL;

- more than half of the share capital and the voting rights must be held by clinical pathologists
practicing within the SEL or by an SPFPL constituted by the clinical pathologists practicing
within the SEL. French law used to provide for an exception whereby more than 50% of the
share capital of a laboratory company could be held by individuals or legal entities which were
external clinical pathologists or laboratory companies if these individuals or entities had an
activity within the corporate purpose of the laboratory company considered or were SPFPL.
However, law n° 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 related to the reform of medical biology has
removed this exception, such change only affecting laboratory companies set up after its
enactment, i.e. after May 31, 2013. Consequently, any laboratory company set up after that
date is subject to the following limitation regarding its ownership: more than 50% of its share
capital and voting rights must be held, directly or indirectly through an SPFPL, by clinical
pathologists working within the laboratory company considered. With regards to laboratory
companies set up prior to May 31, 2013, which, at that date, did not comply with this
requirement, they can still benefit from the former exception regarding ownership by external
clinical pathologists and laboratory companies. However, in case of transfer of their shares,
priority shall be given to clinical pathologists working within the laboratory company
considered. If the latter are unable to buy such shares, said shares can be sold to any external
clinical pathologist or laboratory company or SPFPL, or—within the limitations provided by law
for the shareholding of laboratory companies by non-biologists—to persons that are not
clinical pathologists and legal entities that are not laboratory companies;

136


-----

- persons that are not clinical pathologists and legal entities that are not laboratory companies
cannot directly hold more than 25% of the share capital and voting rights of an SEL (except for
SELCAs, for which this proportion shall be more than 25% but must be less than 50%); to
prevent conflicts of interest, certain types of professionals or entities (including other health
professionals, medical suppliers, pension funds and insurance companies) are prevented from
holding shares in an SEL directly or indirectly;

- at least once a year, the company must provide the Ordre des Pharmaciens and/or the Ordre
_des Médecins with a statement regarding the composition of its share capital;_

- the articles of association of laboratory companies may provide for the inalienability of shares
for a period not exceeding ten years; and

- finally, in order to be binding, all arrangements concerning laboratory companies or their
shareholders that are not contained in the bylaws must be disclosed to, as the case may be, the
_Ordre des Pharmaciens and/or the Ordre des Médecins._

Certain aspects of the legal framework described above have been considered by the European
Court of Justice. In March 2009, the European Commission commenced a proceeding against
France, challenging two provisions of French law. First, the Commission argued that the 25%
ownership limitations placed on third-party non-professionals imposed an undue burden on the
freedom of establishment provided for in the Treaty Establishing the European Community.
Second, the Commission criticized as overly restrictive the rule by which qualified entities or
individuals could not own shares in more than two SELs. In its December 16, 2010 decision, the
European Court of Justice found in favor of France on the first count, holding that the ownership
limitations placed on non-professionals were reasonable in view of the state’s legitimate public
health and safety concerns. The Court noted the threat to such independence that might arise
from financial pressures placed on clinical pathologists by third-party investors and found that a
Member State might validly conclude that the professional independence of clinical pathologists
would not be adequately preserved in structures where such professionals would only hold a
minority of the share capital, regardless of whether they were granted majority voting rights.
The Court found against France on the second count, however, holding that the ownership
restriction placed by existing regulations on qualified professionals was unnecessary and
disproportionate to the public health objectives sought to be achieved. Pursuant to decree
n° 2013-117 dated February 5, 2013 related to the conditions of operation of a laboratory by an
SEL, individuals or legal entities who have an activity within the corporate purpose of the SEL are
no longer subject to the limitation according to which they could not own shares in more than
two SELs.

**_Belgium_**

_Laboratory Ownership and Corporate Structure_

The conditions with respect to ownership and corporate structure which clinical laboratories
must comply with are set forth in Royal Decree No. 143 of December 30, 1982. In the case of
clinical laboratories operated by individuals, there is an explicit prohibition on the operation of
such laboratories by doctors who dispense prescriptions. Such doctors are also barred from acting
as directors, associates (vennoten/associés), members, managers (zaakvoerders/gérants) or
designated representatives of clinical laboratory companies.

Legal form of ownership represents the primary regulatory constraint on the establishment and
operation of clinical laboratories. These regulatory constraints are provided by the Royal Decree
of April 26, 2007. The Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 lists the legal forms that clinical laboratory
companies should take in order to eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public health
insurance system. The duration of this Royal Decree, which was initially due to expire on
December 31, 2009, has been extended retrospectively until December 31, 2012 by a Royal Decree

137


-----

of January 27, 2010. To date, no new extension has been enacted. The relevant agencies have not
shown any indication that reimbursements would cease. The current legal gap should be filled by
a new Decree which, as for March 2017, is still in a draft form and should be submitted to the
Belgian government for approval. According to oral sources at the INAMI, this draft Decree
(i) will leave unchanged the four legal forms that clinical laboratories should take in order to be
eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public health insurance system and (ii) will provide
that these rules are no longer subject to expiration. However, this information has been obtained
by unofficial sources at the INAMI. It is currently unclear whether the draft Decree will be
adopted and, if so, what its content will be. The absence of any form of extension of the
duration of the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 could have a significant impact on all Belgian
laboratories run under the same corporate form as ours, including us. For more information, see
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory
_requirements governing our activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our_
_business activities may be negatively impacted if we fail to comply.”_

The Royal Decree of April 26, 2007, specifies that, in addition to hospitals, universities and other
public bodies, only certain legal entities may operate clinical laboratories, namely civil companies
incorporated in the form of a BVBA/SPRL (besloten vennootschap met beperkte
_aansprakelijkheid/société privée à responsabilité limitée), a general partnership (vennootschap_
_onder firma/société en nom collectif), a cooperative company (cooperative vennootschap/société_
_coopérative) or a non-profit organization (vereniging zonder winstoogmerk/personne morale_
_sans but lucratif)._

The provisions of Belgian company law applicable to Belgian companies that are eligible to
operate clinical laboratories in accordance with the Royal Decree impose certain restrictions on
the transferability of the shares of such companies. For example, any contemplated transfer of
shares in a BVBA/SPRL must be consented to by half of the shareholders holding shares
representing 75% of the capital of the company (minus the value of the shares which are being
transferred). There are no requirements as to the legal form of an entity purchasing shares of a
BVBA/SPRL. Belgian law does not provide for any specific rules with respect to the voting rights
attached to the shares of a laboratory company.

In addition to restrictions on corporate form and share transferability, the Royal Decree of
December 30, 1982, and the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007, set forth additional general
regulations affecting a laboratory company’s conduct. Among other things, such rules stipulate
that:

- the laboratory company must not have a corporate or statutory purpose other than the
operation of clinical laboratories;

- the articles of association of a laboratory company must include a provision to the effect that
the company is required to strive for a standard of quality that avoids any act entailing
complementary expenses which are not justified by the compulsory healthcare insurer, by the
patient or by the persons who insure the payment of these services (to the extent that the
Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 remains applicable after January 1, 2013);

- the laboratory company is required to conclude a written agreement (subject to approval by
the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health) with any persons performing services on its behalf
which should minimally include (i) the financial provisions applicable and (ii) the working
conditions, including their free choice to perform such services as they wish and their access to
all means necessary to guarantee the quality of the services rendered (in particular the
equipment, the personnel and the method to be applied);

- the laboratory company is required to organize a central collection of fees and other
compensations paid by patients or third parties; and

138


-----

- the laboratory company may not accord any benefits, directly or indirectly, to medical
professionals who dispense prescriptions, and it may not influence these professionals in any
way.

The laboratory company must provide the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health with an annual
list of its members or associates (vennoten/associés) and must maintain accounting records,
prepared in accordance with accounting standards set by the Royal Decree of November 18, 1983.

_Pricing and Reimbursement_

Prices and reimbursement levels for laboratory tests are set on an annual basis. Reimbursements
are only granted to clinical laboratories that have been accredited by the Belgian government (in
accordance with the Royal Decree of December 3, 1999 on the accreditation of clinical biology
laboratories by the Minister responsible for Public Health and the Royal Decree of December 5,
2011 on the accreditation of pathological anatomy laboratories by the Minister responsible for
Public Health). Currently, the pricing system includes a “claw-back” mechanism which allows the
Belgian government to recover budgetary overspend in future periods. Reimbursement levels for
tests included in the INAMI catalog are set by the Belgium health authorities. In certain cases,
laboratories are allowed to bill a small supplemental administrative fee per patient in addition to
the set price for a test. Laboratory tests that are prescribed for non-therapeutic reasons may be
excluded from INAMI’s price regulation and are set freely by individual laboratories.

_Quality and Accreditation Standards_

INAMI also requires that clinical laboratories operating in Belgium must meet certain operational
standards set forth by BELAC, the Belgian national accreditation organization. Laboratories are
subject to an inspection every year during the first 3-year period of accreditation. During the
third year of the initial 3-year accreditation period, BELAC will conduct an inspection to verify
whether the clinical laboratory complies with the requirements for a 5-year renewal period of
the accreditation. During each such 5-year renewal period, BELAC will conduct minimum three
inspections (every 18 months at the latest) to verify compliance with BELAC’s standards.

**_Luxembourg_**

_Pricing and Reimbursement_

According to article 65 of the Luxembourg Social Security Code, prices and reimbursement rules
are set by the applicable nomenclature, which is set forth by grand-ducal regulations on the basis
of recommendations of the Nomenclature Commission (“Commission de Nomenclature”). The list
of tests that are reimbursed is set forth by a nomenclature. Other provisions, such as the statutes
of the National Health Fund (“Caisse Nationale de Santé”), also apply.

For patients who are affiliated to the National Health Fund (“Caisse Nationale de Santé”), the
Luxembourg social security system covers 100% of the costs of the laboratory tests (except for
those performed in a hospital) that are (i) on the nomenclature list, (ii) carried out, subject to
certain exceptions, within two months as of the date of the medical prescription related to the
tests and (iii) carried out by laboratories authorized or covered by a convention concluded with
the National Health Fund (“Caisse Nationale de Santé”), at the price set forth by the
nomenclature. Laboratory tests performed for research purposes are not reimbursed by the
Luxembourg social security system.

_Quality and Accreditation Standards_

Pursuant to article 3 of the Luxembourg law dated July 16, 1984 regarding clinical laboratories,
as modified, (the “1984 Law”), the opening and operation of clinical laboratories are subject to
an administrative authorization delivered by the Luxembourg Ministry of Health upon the
opinion (avis) of the Medical Board (Collège Médical) and the Consultative Commission of the
Laboratories (Commission Consultative des Laboratoires).

139


-----

This administrative authorization will be delivered (i) if the creation of the laboratory responds
to a need on the national, regional or local plan and (ii) if the requirements set forth by the 1984
Law and its implementing regulations are met. Mostly, these requirements are related to the
specific qualifications of the person or persons running the clinical laboratory (see
“—Professional Licensing and Ethics” below), in relation with the field of activity of the
laboratory.

Any change in this respect (change of field of activity or change of the responsible person or
persons) must be notified to the Ministry of Health. Such a change would require that a new
administrative authorization be obtained. The administrative authorization can be revoked at
any time by a motivated decision of the Ministry of Health if the legal and regulatory
requirements abovementioned are no longer met.

The overall control of the clinical laboratories is provided by doctors, engineers and
pharmacist-inspectors of the Health Direction (Direction de la Santé), who act as investigating
officers during the execution of their mission. They may be accompanied by experts.

Clinical laboratories must also submit to quality controls which are conducted by public or private
organisms accredited by the Ministry of Health upon the opinion (avis) of the Consultative
Commission of the Laboratories (Commission Consultative des Laboratoires).

Besides this administrative authorization, a clinical laboratory is bound to respect certain
operational and quality standards set forth by the grand-ducal Regulation dated May 27, 2004
setting the minimum criteria to be met regarding the general activities of clinical laboratories.

Infringements of the abovementioned provisions of the 1984 Law and its implementing
regulations are punishable by criminal sanctions set forth by article 15 of the 1984 Law.

In accordance with the law of July 4, 2014, on reorganization of the Luxembourg Institute of
Normalization, Accreditation, Safety and Quality of Products and Services (“Institut
_luxembourgeois de la normalisation, de l’accréditation, de la sécurité et qualité des produits et_
_services, ILNAS”) and on organization of the general framework for the supervision of the_
market in the context of the marketing of products, as modified, which sets out the functions of
the Luxembourg Accreditation and Surveillance Office (“Office Luxembourgeois d’Accréditation
_et de Surveillance, OLAS”), and in accordance with the grand-ducal Regulation dated April 12,_
2016, implementing Articles 3, 5 and 7 of the modified law of July 4, 2014, on reorganization of
the Luxembourg Institute of Normalization, Accreditation, Safety and Quality of Products and
Services, a clinical laboratory can apply to obtain a certification of compliance with the standard
ISO 15189.

_Laboratory Ownership and Corporate Structure_

Pursuant to the 1984 Law, operators of a clinical laboratory can be either one or more
individuals, or a private or public corporate entity.

Hospitals which are compelled to operate a clinical laboratory under the form of a hospital
service can share a common structure in order to operate their services together. The individuals
or the entities described above can become partners in this common structure in order to
participate in the clinical laboratory’s activities which are linked to the hospital sector.

Pursuant to the 1984 Law, the following entities may not become partners in, or own, directly or
indirectly, a part of the share capital of, a corporate entity operating a medical laboratory:

- doctors, dentists, and other health professionals authorized to prescribe medical tests, except
managers of clinical laboratories as described below;

140


-----

- hospitals, without prejudice to the possibility to share a common structure as described above;
and

- members of the managing body of a hospital or persons who directly or indirectly own a part
of the share capital of the managing body of a hospital.

When the laboratory is operated by one or more physical person(s), such person(s) act in the
capacity of director(s) of the laboratory and are bound to effectively and personally perform
their duties in a responsible manner. Managers of clinical laboratories are not allowed to
perform their duties in several clinical laboratories at the same time, or carry out another regular
professional activity other than:

- medical treatments and pharmaceutical prescriptions directly related to biology, and

- teaching functions on an ancillary basis.

Exemptions may be exceptionally granted by the Ministry of Health, upon the opinion (avis) of
the Consultative Commission of the Laboratories (“Commission Consultative des Laboratoires”).

Corporate entities operating a clinical laboratory must appoint one or more managers of a
laboratory with the same duties as described above.

_Professional Licensing and Ethics_

Any clinical laboratory must be placed under the supervision of a person (a manager as described
above) who acts as the legal representative of the laboratory company and is responsible for its
operations.

This manager must either be qualified as a doctor, a pharmacist or a chemist (in this latter case by
holding a Master’s degree in chemistry, biochemistry or the equivalent).

Pursuant to the grand-ducal Regulation dated December 18, 1998 setting the disciplines of a
clinical laboratory and regulating the specialized trainings of laboratories managers, as modified,
the doctor, pharmacist or chemist in charge of a laboratory must in addition have relevant
qualifications in the field of biomedical analysis (at least five years full time training) and a
specialization in the field for which the administrative authorization is to be granted and in
which the laboratory will operate (medical chemistry, hematology, microbiology or anatomical
pathology). The manager of a clinical laboratory must apply for a prior authorization which is
granted by the Ministry of Health. The authorization will be assessed based mainly on the above
qualification requirements. The attributions of the laboratory technicians and technical medical
assistants are determined by the laws and regulations regarding these professions.

The personnel of the laboratory must be able to reach a manager at any time during the
operating hours of the laboratory. A minimal level of staffing of the laboratory may also be
required, depending upon the annual activity of the laboratory. Further, a minimum set of
facilities are required in the laboratory in order to preserve the dignity and the anonymity of the
patients, in particular in relation to facilities used for the collection of patients’ samples. All
results of tests must be kept on file for ten years.

#### Regulations Affecting Our Central Lab Business

Although our Central Lab business is global in scope, we conduct testing in the same laboratory
facilities that we use for our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations. As a result, the
regulations described above also affect our Central Lab business.

141


-----

Additionally, our global footprint in the Central Lab business exposes us to a wide variety of
further regulations designed to ensure the quality and integrity of testing processes across many
different jurisdictions. We believe that our operating procedures are in accordance with the
regulations and guidelines appropriate to each applicable jurisdiction.

We may voluntarily subject ourselves to certain international operating norms or regulatory
standards through commercially negotiated provisions in the contracts governing our business
relationships with our clients. These may include industry standards for conducting preclinical
laboratory testing embodied in Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) standards and those central
laboratory operations standards required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”),
the Department of Health in the United Kingdom, the European Agency for the Evaluation of
Medicinal Products (“EMEA”) in Europe and by similar regulatory authorities in other parts of the
world. Our clinical testing may also be subject to industry standards for the conduct of clinical
research and development studies that are embodied in the regulations for Good Clinical Practice
(“GCP”). The FDA, EMEA and other regulatory authorities require that test results submitted to
such authorities be based on studies conducted in accordance with GCP. As with GLP and Good
Manufacturing Practice, noncompliance with GCP can result in the disqualification of data
collected during a clinical trial.

By virtue of the fact that certain of our clients are subject to specific regulations related to the
pharmaceutical industry, we are subject to audits that are performed by the relevant regulatory
authority tasked with enforcing such regulations, including the FDA and the UK Department of
Health.

# Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions

#### Principal Shareholders

Cefid is a limited liability company (société anonyme) incorporated under the laws of France.
Following the completion of the Acquisition and the Post-Completion Mergers, Cefid will be
fully-owned by BidCo.

BidCo is a société par actions simplifiée incorporated under the laws of France and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Issuer, a société par actions simplifiée incorporated under the laws of
France. The Issuer is a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo, a société par actions simplifiée
incorporated under the laws of France. HoldCo is a wholly owned subsidiary of TopCo, a société
_par actions simplifiée incorporated under the laws of France. UK TopCo, an entity to be_
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and certain managers of the Group, directly
or indirectly through one or more investment vehicles will collectively own the entire share
capital of TopCo upon consummation of the Acquisition. Upon consummation of the Acquisition,
the Sponsors will indirectly hold all of the share capital of UK TopCo.

BidCo, the Issuer, HoldCo, TopCo and UK TopCo were incorporated as holding companies for the
purposes of the acquisition of Cerba HealthCare and its subsidiaries by entities controlled by the
Sponsors.

As of the Acquisition Completion Date, Partners Group and PSP Investments will hold
approximately 60% and 40% of the share capital of UK TopCo, respectively, and Partners Group,
PSP Investments and management will hold approximately 56%, 37% and 7% of the share capital
of TopCo, respectively.

#### Management Equity Participation Program

We plan to establish a management equity participation program on or after the Acquisition
Completion Date, pursuant to which certain managers who are employees of the Group may
indirectly hold, through a management pooling vehicle, a portion of the share capital of TopCo.

#### Related Party Transactions

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we render services to our affiliates and other
related parties. In turn, such related parties may render services to us as part of their business. For
example, as a part of the ordinary course of our Specialized Testing business, we conduct
specialized laboratory tests for routine laboratories that we operate as part of our Routine Lab
business and that are owned and operated directly by our operating subsidiaries. We believe that
all transactions with affiliated companies and persons are negotiated and conducted on a basis
equivalent to those that would have been achievable on an arm’s-length basis and that the terms
of these transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated third parties.

We will also engage in various financing transactions with our shareholders in connection with
the Acquisition.

# Description of Other Indebtedness

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of_
_our indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety_
_by reference to, the underlying documents._

#### Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
**_Overview and Structure_**
In connection with the Financing of the Acquisition, BidCo will, on or prior to the Acquisition
Completion Date, enter into the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement with, among others, Natixis as
agent, the Security Agent, and Credit Suisse International, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch, J.P. Morgan Limited and Natixis, as mandated lead arrangers. The Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement will provide for a Revolving Credit Facility in a principal amount of
€175.0 million and a Senior Term Loan in a principal amount of €794.0 million.

The Senior Term Loan may be utilized by BidCo and may be used to finance: (i) the payment
directly or indirectly of the consideration for the Acquisition (including purchase price
adjustments); (ii) the payment directly or indirectly of certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Acquisition; (iii) the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of the
Target and its subsidiaries and payments of related breakage costs and any other costs related to
such refinancing; (iv) directly or indirectly financing other amounts including fees, costs and
expenses related to or incurred or charged in connection with, amongst other things, the
Acquisition and any transaction contemplated by the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and/or
the Notes; and (v) any other purpose contemplated by the funds flow statement relating to the
Acquisition.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by BidCo and certain other members of the TLB
Group (for the purposes of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the “TLB Group” consists of
BidCo and its subsidiaries from time to time, but excluding unrestricted subsidiaries (under and as
defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement)) who accede as borrowers under the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement, in euros, sterling, U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and certain other
currencies freely available in the London interbank market (subject to obtaining the consent of
all the Revolving Credit Facility lenders) by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of letters of
credit and ancillary facilities (on a bilateral and fronted basis). The Revolving Credit Facility may
be used for the TLB Group’s working capital and general corporate purposes.

In addition to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Term Loan, the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement includes the ability (without double counting against the limitation on indebtedness
covenant) to incur additional indebtedness (including under one or more uncommitted
additional facilities within the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and/or any additional Notes
and/or other facilities or notes documented outside the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement) up to
an aggregate amount the greater of €160.0 million and 100% of LTM EBITDA (as defined in the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and subject to certain customary additions including the
amount of prepayments and buy-backs), plus an unlimited amount, provided that, pro forma for
the incurrence of such additional facilities or permitted alternative debt: (i) if such indebtedness
is secured on the Collateral, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement such that such liabilities rank
_pari passu with the Senior Term Loan, the consolidated net secured leverage ratio does not_
exceed 5.50:1; or (ii) if the indebtedness does not fall within paragraph (i), the fixed charge
coverage ratio does not exceed 2.00:1, and in each case, subject to certain other conditions being
met.

**_Availability_**
The Senior Term Loan will be available on and from the date of the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement up to (and including) the earliest to occur of (i) 11:59 p.m. (in London) on the date on
which the first utilization of the facilities under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement occurs (the
“Closing Date”); (ii) the earlier of (x) August 31, 2017 and (y) 20 business days following the

147


-----

longstop dates set out in the Acquisition Agreements, as may be extended by the parties thereto
in accordance with their terms; and (iii) the date on which BidCo (or any of its affiliates)
determines and notifies the agent under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement in writing that
the Acquisition Agreements have been conclusively terminated prior to the Acquisition
Completion Date, by either party thereto in accordance with its terms.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) the Closing Date to (and
including) the date which is one month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the Senior Credit Facilities are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will initially bear interest at rates per annum
equal to LIBOR or, for loans denominated in euro, EURIBOR, plus an applicable margin, which in
each case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated senior
secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement) (the “Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).

From the first day following one complete financial quarter following the Closing Date, the
margin applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to adjustment by reference to
the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as shown in the then most recent compliance certificate,
to equal the rate per annum set out in the following table:


**Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio:**

From the first day following one complete financial quarter following the Closing Date, the
margin applicable to the Senior Term Loans will be subject to adjustment by reference to the
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as shown in the then most recent compliance certificate, to
equal the rate per annum set out in the following table:


**Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio:**

Greater than 5.00x . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

**Senior Term**
**Loan Margin**
**(% p.a.)**


If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of Senior Term
Loans. If LIBOR or EURIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR or EURIBOR (as the case may be) shall be
deemed to be zero in respect of Revolving Credit Facility Loans.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the
Revolving Credit Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability period applicable of
the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit
Facility. Commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears and on the date the Revolving
Credit Facility is canceled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its
commitment.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

148


-----

**_Repayments_**

The Senior Term Loan will be repaid in full on the date that is seven years from the Closing Date.
In respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the
interest period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding
amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date falling seventy eight
months from the Closing Date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the
Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to
_de minimis amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain_
circumstances, including:

- on a change of control of BidCo or disposal of substantially all the business of the TLB Group
(in each case such mandatory prepayment shall only apply upon a lender exercising its
individual right to be repaid within the prescribed time period);

- on an initial public offering which does not constitute a change of control (subject to the TLB
Group’s ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each
as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement)) (a “Listing Prepayment”);

- from certain net cash proceeds received by the TLB Group from certain asset disposals, to the
extent required to be applied in prepayment of the Senior Credit Facilities and subject to a de
_minimis amount; and_

- unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement,
for each financial year (commencing with the first full financial year following the Closing
Date), a percentage of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum
threshold amount, which percentage decreases as the TLB Group’s ratio of consolidated senior
secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement) decreases (an “Excess Cash Flow Prepayment”).

At the election of BidCo, amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to a Listing Prepayment or an
Excess Cash Flow Prepayment may instead be applied in repayment of any other indebtedness of
the TLB Group which does not rank junior to the Senior Term Loan.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Senior Credit Facilities are guaranteed by BidCo, each Guarantor, Cerballiance Réunion and
Cerballiance Hauts-de-France (the “Senior Credit Facilities Guarantors”) and are secured by first
ranking pledges over (i) the share capital of each Senior Credit Facilities Guarantor held by a
member of the Group or, in the case of BidCo, held by the Issuer; (ii) the bank accounts of certain
of the Senior Credit Facilities Guarantors; (iii) in respect of the Issuer, the structural intra-group
receivables owed to the Senior Notes Issuer by BidCo; and (iv) in respect of BidCo, receivables
owed to BidCo by the Target and Cerba Selafa.

Subject to certain adjustments and agreed security principles in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will require BidCo to ensure that members of
the TLB Group that generate at least 80% of “Consolidated EBITDA” (as defined in the section
entitled “Description of the Notes”) are guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
(i) on the date which is 120 days after the Closing Date; and (ii) on the date when the annual
financial statements of the Issuer are required to be delivered to the agent under the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security set forth above will in all cases be subject to certain
limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and

149


-----

the other matters set forth in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes—The Note Guarantees and the Security Interests over the Collateral may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect_
_their validity and enforceability.”_

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will contain certain representations and warranties
(subject to certain agreed qualifications and with certain representations being repeated),
including: (i) status, binding obligations, non-conflict with other obligations, power and
authority, validity and admissibility in evidence, governing law and enforcement, consents,
fillings and laws applicable to operations and pari passu ranking; (ii) no insolvency, no litigation,
environmental laws, taxation, and filing and stamp taxes; (iii) no default, financial statements,
group structure, and no misleading information in relation to the information memorandum and
the financial model relating to the Group and certain diligence reports provided; (iv) no liens,
guarantees or indebtedness, except as permitted; (v) legal and beneficial ownership and holding
company activities; (vi) intellectual property and pension schemes; (vii) acquisition documents
contain all material terms and conditions of the Acquisition; and (viii) centre of main interests
and compliance with sanctions and anti-corruption laws.

Certain representations and warranties will be made on the Closing Date and repeated on the
date of each utilization, on the first day of each interest period and at certain other times.

**_Covenants_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants, information
undertakings and related definitions (with, in each case, certain adjustments), including
(i) limitations on indebtedness; (ii) limitations on restricted payments; (iii) limitations on liens
(which includes a restriction on designating certain credit facilities and/or hedging obligations
secured on the Collateral as Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in the section entitled
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”) unless, prior to such designation,
the Senior Term Loan has been refinanced in full (ignoring any participation (x) of a lender which
has been rolled over in a refinancing (or otherwise) of the Senior Term Loan and/or (y) in respect
of which a lender has declined prepayment)); (iv) limitation on restrictions on distributions from
restricted subsidiaries; (v) limitations on sale of assets and subsidiary stock; (vi) limitations on
affiliate transactions; (vii) merger and consolidation; (viii) suspension of covenants on
achievement of investment grade status; (ix) additional guarantees; and (x) no impairment of
security interests.

In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement also requires the Issuer and certain of its
restricted subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants,
subject to certain exceptions and grace periods, including covenants relating to: (i) authorizations
and consents; (ii) compliance with laws; (iii) pari passu ranking; (iv) insurances; (v) payment of
taxes; (vi) pension schemes; (vii) compliance with certain environmental laws; (viii) acquisition
documents; (ix) maintenance of centre of main interests; (x) provision of guarantees and security,
further assurance and accession to the Intercreditor Agreement; (xi) compliance with sanctions
and anti-corruption laws; (xii) maintenance of ratings; (xiii) preservation of assets; and
(xiv) conditions subsequent relating to the confirmation of release and repayment of certain
existing indebtedness of the Target and Manco and each of their subsidiaries.

Solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement will require that, in the event that the aggregate amount of all cash
loans drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations by way of letters of
credit (or bank guarantees) or ancillary facilities or any amounts utilized to fund any agreed fees
in connection with the syndication of the Senior Credit Facilities) exceeds 40 per cent of the total
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility on the relevant testing date or, if higher, the

150


-----

total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as at the original date of the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement (the “Revolving Test Condition”), the ratio of consolidated senior secured
net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA does not exceed 10.9 to 1.00. The ratio is based on
the definitions in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, which may differ from similar
definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this Offering
Memorandum.

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the shareholders of
BidCo to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to BidCo to (i) increase the
consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, (ii) decrease
consolidated senior secured net debt, or (iii) prepay the Revolving Credit Facility so that the
Revolving Test Condition is no longer satisfied. The equity cure right may not be exercised on
more than five occasions during the term of the Senior Credit Facilities and may not be utilized in
consecutive quarters.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement will fall-away on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the
occurrence of a listing in respect of which the TLB Group’s ratio of consolidated total net debt to
consolidated pro forma EBITDA does not exceed an agreed ratio or (ii) BidCo having a long-term
corporate credit rating equal to or better than Baa3 according to Moody’s Investor Services
Limited or BBB- according to Standard & Poor’s Rating Services.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as
under the Notes. In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement provides for additional
events of default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including:
(i) breach of the financial covenant, provided that, in the event of such breach, only a majority of
the Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility shall initially be entitled to take enforcement
action; (ii) inaccuracy of representation or statement when made; (iii) invalidity and unlawfulness
of the Senior Credit Facilities financing documents; (iv) material failure to comply with the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (v) cross defaults and cross acceleration in respect of other
obligations, including any event of default under the Notes.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in
accordance with English law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events
of default and related definitions scheduled to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will be
interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement is governed by English law).

#### Intercreditor Agreement
**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the
Issuer and the Guarantors will enter into an Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the
agent, arrangers and lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Security
Agent. On or about the Issue Date, the Trustee in respect of the Notes will become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Issuer will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor,
Third Party Security Provider and Topco Subordinated Creditor.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the
terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing
the relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the

151


-----

Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement
as a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, when payments can be made in respect of debt of
the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect
of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the
occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to
read that document because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the
holders of the Notes and of the Trustee. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the

For the purposes of this description:

“ICA Group” shall mean BidCo and its subsidiaries.

References to the “Notes” shall include the Notes and any other notes, securities or other debt
instruments issued or to be issued by a member of the ICA Group or by holding companies of
BidCo which are designated by BidCo as Topco Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement uses the term “Topco” to refer to the Issuer and “Topco Liabilities”
to refer to the Notes and other indebtedness of the Issuer and other holding companies of BidCo.
References to Topco Liabilities and related definitions in this description only should be read
accordingly and not (unless expressly indicated) as references to “TopCo” as otherwise defined in
this Offering Memorandum.

Group to the Issuer (other than the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities) or to any other person who
becomes a subordinated creditor (a “Subordinated Creditor”) under the Intercreditor Agreement
(the “Subordinated Liabilities”) will be subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors and

-----

The Topco Independent Transaction Security shall rank and secure the Topco Liabilities pari passu
and without any preference between them (but only to the extent that such security is expressed
to secure the relevant liabilities).

The Notes and the Notes Guarantee will be Notes Liabilities and Topco Liabilities for purposes of
the Intercreditor Agreement. On the Issue Date of the Notes, no Senior Secured Notes Liabilities,
Second Lien Lender Liabilities or Second Lien Notes Liabilities will be outstanding and no
liabilities will have been designated as Super Senior Liabilities. Such liabilities and liabilities in
respect of other new debt financings may only be incurred and/or designated if not prohibited
under the terms of the Debt Documents, including, without limitation, the covenants applicable
to the Notes described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

_Guarantees and Security: Topco Creditors_

The creditors in respect of the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco Creditors”) have the right to take,
accept or receive the benefit of any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance from any member
of the ICA Group in respect of the Topco Liabilities in addition to any guarantee, indemnity or
assurance (i) in the original form of the Topco Finance Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement, or (ii) given to all the Secured Parties as security for the liabilities of the Topco
Group, each Debtor and each Third Party Security Provider to the Secured Parties under the Debt
Documents if, subject to any agreed security principles:

(i) at the same time it is also offered to the Secured Parties other than the Topco Creditors (the
“Priority Secured Parties”) and ranks in the same order of priority as described under “Priority of
_Security” above; and_

(ii) all amounts received by any Topco Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity or
assurance are paid to the Security Agent for application as set out under “Application of
_Proceeds” below._

No security (other than pursuant to the secured documents relating to Topco Independent
Transaction Security or Topco Shared Security) shall be granted by a member of the ICA Group in
respect of any Topco Liabilities.

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of
existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco
Liabilities, or, following the Designation Date, Super Senior Liabilities or Pari Passu Hedging
Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification by BidCo that such
New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the finance documents relating to the
Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities, the
Topco Liabilities or any unsecured liabilities whose creditors are party to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement,
exchange, set-off, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or
new financing arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with any New
Debt Financing, each Debtor or Third Party Security Provider and the Security Agent is authorized
to enter into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security
document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security (as the case may be) subject to certain conditions, including as regards the
parties in whose favor such security is granted, and the terms of such security (which shall be,
unless otherwise agreed by BidCo, substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets). In
addition, the Intercreditor Agreement permits, subject to the terms of the other Debt

Documents, the incurrence of indebtedness which has super priority status in respect of the
proceeds from the enforcement of collateral compared with other senior indebtedness.

**_Permitted Payments_**
_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_
The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior
Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management
Facility Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities”, the creditors in respect
thereof being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following acceleration
events under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Notes or
Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in
relation to a member of the ICA Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party
Security Providers and received by creditors in accordance with the provisions described below
under “Application of Proceeds.”

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_
The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions governing payment of the Second
Lien Liabilities and the circumstances in which creditors in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities
(the “Second Lien Creditors”) may take enforcement action. On the Acquisition Completion Date,
no Second Lien Liabilities will have been incurred by the ICA Group.

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the
Second Lien Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged
(the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”), the Debtors may only make scheduled payments in
respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing such
Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor
Agreement. The principal conditions are that the relevant payment is not prohibited by any prior
ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and
any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been
obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the
relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the
case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under any Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Facilities Agreement, Cash
Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Notes/Topco Liabilities_
Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the
“Second Lien Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the
“Priority Discharge Date”), the Debtors, Topco Borrowers and Third Party Security Providers may
only make scheduled payments under the Topco Liabilities or under any Topco Proceeds Loan
(together the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco Creditors or the Issuer or any other lender
in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (such
payments, collectively, “Permitted Topco Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) the payment is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of
the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to
permit such payment has been obtained;

(B) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(C) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than
principal, interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior

Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document (a “Senior Secured Payment Default”), or
under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

156

been waived by Senior Lenders, Super Senior Lenders or the lenders in respect of any Second
Lien Lender Liabilities, (3) of cash interest, (4) made in pursuance of a debt buy-back program
approved by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and
Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), (5) any other amount permitted to be
paid under the prior ranking financing agreements, or (6) amounts due under any fee or
syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents.

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/
or a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing, but provided that no creditors under any prior ranking debt facilities have
accelerated their debt, the payment is of (A) a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and
made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon
illegality or in relation to the prepayment of a single lender in the event of a tax gross-up,
increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable, or (B) any other amount permitted to be
paid in accordance with (iii) below;

(iii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/
or a Senior Secured Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and irrespective of whether
any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the payment is (A) of
ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents, (B) of
commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations
and a Topco Agent’s fees and expenses not exceeding €1,500,000, but excluding the costs of any
litigation against a Senior Secured Creditor, (C) of any amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as
defined below), (D) of costs necessary to protect, preserve or enforce security, (E) of any costs,
fees (including amendment and waiver fees) taxes, premiums and expense incurred in respect of
or reasonably incidental to the Topco Finance Documents, (F) of any other amount not exceeding
€2,500,000 in any 12 month period, (G) of any amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have
been payable but for the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired) which
has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities, provided that no
such payment may be made if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured
Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment,
(H) following the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second
Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities
being released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares in any
holding company of BidCo (a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent
payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control
as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any
Liabilities owed by a member of the ICA Group to another member of the ICA Group, to the
Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of BidCo that arise as a result of any
such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien
Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second
Lien Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities
or Subordinated Liabilities owed by any member of the ICA Group, and (I) of non-cash interest
made by way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non cash-pay instrument which is subordinated
on the same terms as the Topco Liabilities; or

(iv) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior consent to that
payment being made.

157


-----

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party
Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance
with the Topco Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Notes/Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following
the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event
of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of
Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Senior Secured Creditors or
Second Lien Creditors as the case may be) issues a notice (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the
agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the Trustee advising that the Senior
Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments
by the ICA Group of the Topco Group Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled
maturity of the relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of
Default has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Senior
Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors, as applicable) delivers a notice to the Issuer, the
Topco Agent and the Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under
the Intercreditor Agreement (see “Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior
Secured Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the
occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may
be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of
360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the
issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a
consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group
Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under any
Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to make
any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Topco
Finance Document or Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement even if its obligation to make such
payment is restricted at any time by the those provisions. The accrual and capitalization of
interest (if any) in accordance with the Topco Finance Documents or Topco Proceeds Loan
Agreement shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice.

158


-----

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop
Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment
Default or Second Lien Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or the
Issuer (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan
Agreement (as applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that
Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco
Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a
result of that suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further
action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior
to the latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the
Second Lien Discharge Date and the Topco Discharge Date (the “Final Discharge Date”) and prior
to the Designation Date, any creditor receives or recovers from any member of the ICA Group or
Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed
to the creditors under the Debt Documents which is not either (x) a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below under
“Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
security, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a member of the ICA
Group or any Third Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any security;

(iv) any Soulte except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “Application of
_Proceeds”;_

(v) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(vi) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of
the liabilities owed by any member of the ICA Group or Third Party Security Provider which is not
in accordance with the provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event,

159


-----

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) for the Security Agent and
promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to
the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time
prior to the Final Discharge Date but after the Designation Date, any creditor receives or recovers
from any member of the ICA Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the
enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an
acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged
property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the
Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “Application of
_Proceeds.”_

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Debtor, Material Subsidiary (as defined in the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any
resolution or making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution,
administration or reorganization, (b) a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement
with any class of creditors generally (other than any Secured Party), (c) a moratorium is declared
in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver,
administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of
it or any of its assets, or (e) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other
than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments which the
Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under the Senior
Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities and otherwise not constituting a
default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party
Security Provider (in the case of a Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the
extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for
the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the
Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid
to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the ICA Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors or Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities are discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or
otherwise and in the case of a Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the
extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the
liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provisions set out under “Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in
cash in respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and
except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

160


-----

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each
creditor authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make
demands, collect distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after
the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to a member of the ICA Group or Third Party
Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in
order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien
Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the
Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or
Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have given no instructions or has instructed the Security
Agent neither to enforce nor to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Trustee (acting
on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Instructing Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the
preceding paragraph may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to

enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the
realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions before the

Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not
apply in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities or any Transaction Security securing the Topco
Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement
(the “Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, and Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default
specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco
Agent, the Trustee or the Topco Borrower in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, the
Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice
notifying the facility agent under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (or Permitted Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement) (the “Senior Agent”), any senior secured notes trustee, the Second
Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start
Date”) a Topco Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and
ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Topco Note Standstill Start Date (the “Topco Standstill
Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a
Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the
same Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken
by the Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other
member of the ICA Group or Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to
preserve or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in relation to a particular Topco
Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned
Topco Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or
other permitted remedy).

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may
take Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco

165


-----

_Enforcement) in relation to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco_
Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of
any other event of default in respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any
Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors
may elect to purchase the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second
Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such
liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the
counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in
exchange for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had
they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such
purchase.

**_Proceeds of Non-Distressed Disposals_**

If (i) a Debtor or Guarantor resigns in accordance with the Debt Documents, or (ii) BidCo certifies
in relation to a disposal of an asset of a Debtor or an asset which is subject to the Transaction
Security, that (A) as at the date or completion or (at the election of BidCo) as of the date a
definitive agreement is entered into in respect of the relevant disposal, it is not prohibited under
the Debt Documents or consent from the relevant agents has been obtained, and (B) the disposal
is not a Distressed Disposal (as described below) (each a “Non-Distressed Disposal”), then the
Security Agent (and any applicable agent or creditor) is irrevocably authorized, instructed and
obliged to:

(i) release the Transaction Security and any other claim (including relating to a Debt Document)
over that asset;

(ii) where a Debtor or Guarantor resigns or the asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor,
Guarantor or Third Party Security Provider, to release the Transaction Security and any other
claim including without limitation any guarantee liabilities or other liabilities (relating to a Debt
Document) over that Debtor, Guarantor, Third Party Security Provider or its assets and (if any) its
subsidiaries and their respective assets; and

(iii) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Transaction Security or any claim
described in (i) and (ii) above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating
charge, any consent to dealing and take any other action or step that may be requested by the
requesting Debtor, Guarantor or Third Party Security Provider in order to complete, implement or
facilitate the resignation or disposal.

If the relevant Non-Distressed Disposal is not made, each release of security or any claim
described in the paragraph above shall have no effect and the security or claim subject to that
release shall continue in such force and effect as if that release had not been effected.

**_Proceeds of Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued
by a member of the ICA Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, Topco Shared
Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where
the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an acceleration event, (b) by
enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event, or (c) after the
occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a result of an acceleration
event, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member
of the Topco Group.

166


-----

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized
(at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and BidCo and without any
consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor
Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of
that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary
or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or
other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that
Debtor over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor,
Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all
or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted
by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and
(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor
over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf
of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding
company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured
Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding
any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured
Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of
all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any
other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;
and/or

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or
any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed
Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which
those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

167


-----

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco
Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intragroup liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving
Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed
to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
provisions set out under “Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds
of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities
has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of,
the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in
the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to
postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are
entitled to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid
(or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash
management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled
to give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security
Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second
Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior
Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility,
made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor)
following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities,
Topco Group Liabilities or unsecured liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities
transferred to a holding company of BidCo, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably
authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or BidCo and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are
required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is
being effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction
Security over shares in a borrower or issuer of, or over assets of a borrower or issuer of, Second
Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities will be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a
further condition to the release that either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent and Topco Agent (as applicable) have approved the release; or

168


-----

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor (a “Second Lien Guarantor”) in
respect of Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Guarantor are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other
marketable securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or
substantially in cash) and/or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has been
obtained in accordance with the provisions set out below; and

(B) all claims of the Secured Parties against a member of the ICA Group (if any), all of whose
shares are pledged in favor of the Priority Secured Parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to
such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and
all Transaction Security, Topco Independent Transaction Security or other security in favor of
the Secured Parties in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the
event of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(I) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent
and any senior secured notes trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith,
that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such claim was released or
discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, and
(ii) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

(II) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien
Agent and any second lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith
that the Priority Secured Parties (collectively) will recover more than if such claim was
released or discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding amount of the liabilities
owed to the Priority Secured Parties (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”), and (ii) serve a
notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same; and

(III) where the Topco Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Topco Agent and the
Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Priority Secured Parties
and the Topco Creditors (collectively) will recover more than if such claim was released or
discharged but is nevertheless less than the outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities and the
Topco Liabilities (collectively), and (ii) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the
Security Agent of the same;

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to
such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer
may be in the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors, Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (whichever constitutes the Instructing Group) bidding by an
appropriate mechanic the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities (as
applicable) such that the relevant liabilities would on completion be discharged to the extent of
an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant creditors; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance with
the advice of a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third party
professional firm with a view to obtaining the best price reasonably obtainable taking into
account all relevant circumstances and in which creditors under the Second Lien Liabilities
and Topco Liabilities are entitled to participate as prospective buyers and or/financiers; or

(II) where a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing such valuations has delivered an

169


-----

opinion (including an enterprise valuation) in respect of such sale or disposal that the
amount is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances
including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such investment bank,
firm of accountants or third party professional firm in giving such opinion may be limited
to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super
Senior Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain
unpaid after the first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the
“Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given class in
the proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate
exposures of all the creditors in that class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors
will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the
relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses
are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be
amended or waived only with the consent of BidCo, the agents and trustees for the Secured
Parties, and the Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or
consent only affects one class of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not
reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of
creditors, only written agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class
shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or
which relates to, among other matters, the provisions set out under “Application of Proceeds”
above and the order of priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be
made without the consent of (i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the
relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second
Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the
extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and
would not adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors),
(iii) each Hedge Counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the
Intercreditor Agreement and would not adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other
creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) BidCo.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of
creditors it represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act
on such instructions or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any
amendments so consented or authorized to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights
and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

172


-----

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the
Security Agent may, if BidCo consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the
requirements of or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security which shall
be binding on each party and the prior consent of the Secured Parties is required to authorize
any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction
Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction
Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security are
distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as
such (including, without limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under
the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger
or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraphs and the first paragraph above under “Amendments and Waivers:
_Transaction Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor_
Agreement, relating in particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or
(ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of
additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “New Debt Financings,” “Proceeds
_of Non-Distressed Disposals” and “Proceeds of Distressed Disposals” above. Any release,_
amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt
Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by BidCo and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve
any action or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any creditor fails to respond to the request within 10 Business Days (or any other
period of time notified by BidCo, with the agreement of each of the agents or trustee in the case
of a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such creditor will
be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed to
have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the ICA Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an ”IPO”) where the Qualifying IPO Condition (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement) has been satisfied (subject to receipt of the required creditor consent from the
applicable Secured Creditors), BidCo is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt
Documents will automatically operate so that the ICA Group (and all related provisions) will now
refer to the entity who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the
“IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if the Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such
IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the Issuer or any other holding company of BidCo which is
the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its subsidiaries and so that certain provisions
of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease
to apply to any entity which, consequent on such change, is no longer a member of the ICA
Group. Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations
under the Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor,
Third Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement) or
Topco Independent Obligor will be released from its obligations and restrictions under the
Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity. Subject to the consent of the majority
lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities, noteholders representing more than

173


-----

50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Majority Second Lien Creditors and the Majority
Topco Creditors (following the relevant IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall
also be released from all obligations as Debtor and Guarantor under the Debt Documents and
from the Transaction Security. Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to
enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate
such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

The Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in the Debt Documents to the contrary, save that
this override will not cure, postpone, waive or negate any default or event of default (however
described) under any Debt Document (or any event that would but for the override constitute a
breach, default or event of default (however described)) as between any creditor and any Debtor
or Third Party Security Provider party to the relevant Debt Document, subject to the exception
that any step or action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (other than to the extent it
would result in any member of the ICA Group contravening any law or regulation, or present a
material risk of liability for any member of the ICA Group or its directors or officers or give rise to
a material risk of breach of fiduciary or statutory duties) will be deemed permitted under the
relevant Debt Document.

#### Finance Leases

Certain of our subsidiaries are party to finance leases totaling €42.4 million as of December 31,
2016. The finance leases are not subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

#### Bilateral Credit Facilities

Certain subsidiaries of Cerba HealthCare (including certain of the Guarantors) have entered into
bilateral credit facilities with a number of banks. As of December 31, 2016, €83.4 million was
owed under the bilateral credit facilities, which have maturities ranging from 2017 to 2023 (see
also Note 6.22.1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of Cerba HealthCare included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum) and applicable interest rates ranging from 0.6% to
5.2%. Certain of the bilateral credit facilities are secured, either by the assets financed by the
facilities or by the fixed assets of the borrowing entity. The proceeds of the Offering will be used
to repay €20.0 million of these bilateral credit facilities on or around the Acquisition Completion
Date, and approximately €63.4 million will remain outstanding. The bilateral credit facilities are
not subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

#### Hedging Obligations

We enter into interest rate swaps from time to time in order to hedge against interest rate risk
associated with our borrowings subject to floating rates of interest, including the Senior Term
Loan. As the Notes have a fixed rate of interest, we do not anticipate entering into any interest
rate hedges in connection therewith.

# Description of the Notes

The following is a description of the €180 million in aggregate principal amount of % Senior
Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by NewCo Sab MidCo S.A.S. (the “Issuer”).
In this “Description of the Notes,” the “Issuer” refers only to NewCo Sab MidCo S.A.S., and any
successor obligor to NewCo Sab MidCo S.A.S. under the Indenture and the Notes, and not to any
of its Subsidiaries.

Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement and release of the
Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account (each as defined below), the proceeds of the
offering (the “Offering”) of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be onlent by the Issuer to Bidco
and be used by Bidco, together with the Equity Contribution and drawings under the TLB Facility,
to finance the Acquisition, to repay the Existing Notes as well as certain existing Indebtedness of
the Target Group and to pay certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transactions, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.”

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture, to be dated as of the Issue Date (the
“Indenture”), among, inter alios, the Issuer, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”)
and security agent (the “Security Agent”). The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is
not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The
terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture. The Indenture will not be qualified
under, be subject to, or include or incorporate by reference terms of, the Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and refers to
the Escrow Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. It does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to all provisions of the
Indenture, the Notes, the Escrow Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is
important to you. You should read the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents in their entirety. The Intercreditor Agreement overrides
any provisions in the Indenture and to the extent that any step or action is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement, it will be deemed permitted under the Indenture. Copies of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents are available as described
under “Listing Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description
under “—Certain Definitions.”

Pending the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described under the caption “—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Initial Purchasers (as defined in this Offering_
Memorandum) will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date, deposit the
gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into a euro-denominated escrow account (the
“Escrow Account”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”)
dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the
escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property (as
defined below), as more fully described below under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption,” have not been satisfied on the Business Day following September 30,_
2016 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes
will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest from the Issue Date to (but excluding) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date
(as defined below) and Additional Amounts, if any. See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.”_

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. In general,
only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.

#### Brief Description of the Notes

**_Ranking of the Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be general, senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes;

- be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis as provided under “—The Note Guarantees”;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer
that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, or that is secured on a first
priority basis by property or assets that secure the Notes on a second priority basis, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such debt; and

- following the Completion Date, be structurally subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes, including
obligations to trade creditors.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by : (i) Bidco, as of the Issue Date
and (ii) Cerballiance Côte d’Azur, Cerballiance Paris, Cerballiance Paris Sud, Cerballiance
Provence, Cerballiance Rhône Alpes, CERBA Selafa and LLAM SA (together with Bidco, the
“Guarantors”) within 120 days of the Completion Date. Certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may
be required to guarantee the Notes in the future under certain circumstances. Each Note
Guarantee of a Guarantor will:

- be general, senior subordinated obligations of that Guarantor;

- be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of that
Guarantor, including that Guarantor’s guarantee of indebtedness incurred under the Senior
Facilities Agreement;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future senior
subordinated debt that is not subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of such Guarantor’s future debt that is subordinated in
right of payment to its Guarantee;

- be secured by the Collateral;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of that Guarantor (including
obligations to trade creditors) that is secured on a first-priority basis by property or assets that
secure the Notes on a second-priority basis, or by property or assets that do not constitute
Collateral, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligations or
indebtedness;

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt of such Guarantor’s subsidiaries
(including obligations to trade creditors) that do not guarantee the Notes; and

- be subject to limitations described herein and in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,” “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—In certain jurisdictions, security over the Collateral will be
_granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of_
_the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law,” “Risk_

176


-----

_Factors—Additional Risks Related to the Notes—The Notes are structurally subordinated to the_
_liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The_
_insolvency and administrative laws of France and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as_
_favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction_
_with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and_
_enforceability.”_

Substantially all the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of
creditors of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if
any) of those Subsidiaries, generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders
of the Notes. The Notes therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade
creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee
the Notes. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, these limitations will be subject to a number of
significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence
by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

The obligations of the Guarantors will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and be
contractually limited under the applicable Note Guarantees to reflect limitations under
applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective
shareholders, directors and general partners as further outlined below.

_France_

To ensure compliance with French law, the Note Guarantees of the French Guarantors will be
subject to substantially the following limitation language in the Indenture:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any obligations or liabilities incurred or assumed
under or in connection with its Note Guarantee provided by any of the Guarantors incorporated
in France (each, a “French Guarantor”) pursuant to the Indenture and/or pursuant to a
Supplemental Indenture shall not include any obligations or liabilities which if incurred would
constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of article L.225-216 of the
French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and/or would constitute a misuse of corporate
assets within the meaning of article L.241-3, L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce) or any replacement law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted
by French courts.

In any case, the obligations and liabilities incurred by any French Guarantor that is not a holding
company of the Issuer (a “French Subsidiary Guarantor”) under or in connection with its Note
Guarantee insofar as required to guarantee the payment obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the Indenture shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(i) all Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer (in such capacity) and made available by it directly
or indirectly by way of intra-group loans, bonds or advances or any similar arrangements to
that French Subsidiary Guarantor or its Subsidiaries; and

(ii) all Indebtedness borrowed or incurred under intra-group loans, bonds or advances or any
similar arrangements made available directly or indirectly to that French Subsidiary
Guarantor or its Subsidiaries with the proceeds of Indebtedness previously incurred by a
holding company of such French Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent that such Indebtedness is
or has been refinanced directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Indebtedness of the Issuer
constituting Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which term
includes the Notes; provided that the aggregate amount guaranteed by such French
Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to this sub-paragraph (ii) shall not exceed the aggregate

177


-----

amount of then outstanding Intra-Group Debt (as defined below) referred to in this
sub-paragraph (ii) or any equivalent provision under any guarantee granted by such French
Subsidiary Guarantor under a Secured Debt Document (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement),

(together, the “Intra-Group Debt”),

and which, in each case, are outstanding on the date on which a demand for payment is made to
such French Subsidiary Guarantor; it being specified that:

(a) any payment made by such French Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee shall
reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the Intra-Group Debt (if any) due by such
French Subsidiary Guarantor; and

(b) any Intra-Group Debt made available directly or indirectly to a French Subsidiary
Guarantor may not be double counted with the portion of such Intra-Group Debt which has
been on-lent by such French Subsidiary Guarantor to its Subsidiaries.

The obligations and liabilities incurred or assumed by any French Guarantor that is a holding
company of the Issuer under or in connection with its Note Guarantee insofar as required to
guarantee the payment obligations of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, will not in relation to any
amount due under or in connection with its Note Guarantee, be limited and will therefore
include all amounts due by the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture.

It is acknowledged that any payment made by a French Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note
Guarantee or of the Intra-Group Debt shall reduce the maximum amount of its Note Guarantee.

The amount secured by any Collateral which is granted by any such French Guarantor (or any
other Guarantor that is incorporated in France) will likewise be limited by the amount which it is
so able to guarantee.

_Luxembourg_

To ensure compliance with Luxembourg law, the Note Guarantees of the Luxembourg
Guarantors will be subject to substantially the following limitation language in the Indenture:

Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in the Indenture or in any other Note
Document, the maximum liability of any Luxembourg Guarantor under its Note Guarantee
together with any similar guarantee or indemnity obligation of the Luxembourg Guarantor
under or in connection with any other Note Document (the “Guarantee”) for the obligations of
any obligor under the Notes which is not a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Luxembourg
Guarantor shall be limited to an amount not exceeding the greater of (without double counting):

(i) 95 per cent. of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres), as referred to
in annex I to the grand-ducal regulation dated December 18, 2015 defining the form and
content of the presentation of balance sheet and profit and loss account, and implementing
the Luxembourg law dated December 19, 2002 concerning the trade and companies register
and the accounting and annual accounts of undertakings (the “Regulation”) as increased by
the amount of any Subordinated Debt (as defined below), each as reflected in the
Luxembourg Guarantor’s most recent financial statements available as of the Issue Date; or

(ii) 95 per cent. of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres), as referred to
in the Regulation as increased by the amount of Subordinated Debt (as defined below), each
as reflected in the Luxembourg Guarantor’s most recent financial statements available to the
Trustee at the time the guarantee is called.

For the purposes of this provision, “Subordinated Debt” means the Luxembourg Guarantor’s
debt which is subordinated in right of payment (whether generally or specifically) to any claim of
any Holder under any of the Note Document.

The above limitation shall not apply to any amounts borrowed by, or made available to, in any
form whatsoever, the Luxembourg Guarantor or any of its direct or indirect present or future
Subsidiaries under any Note Document (or any document entered into in connection therewith).

178


-----

For the purpose of this provision, the aggregate amount payable a Luxembourg Guarantor, in its
capacity as a guarantor, shall not include any obligation which, if incurred would constitute a
misuse of corporate assets as defined in article 171-1 of the Luxembourg act dated August 10,
1915 concerning commercial companies, as amended (the “Companies Act 1915”) or, a breach of
the provisions of financial assistance as referred to in article 49-6 of the Companies Act 1915.

The amount secured by any Collateral which is granted by any such Luxembourg Guarantor (or
any other Guarantor that is incorporated in Luxembourg) will likewise be limited by the amount
which it is so able to guarantee.

**_Note Guarantees Release_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:

- a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of
the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer as a result of the sale or other disposition;

- the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all
the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), if the
sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture;

- the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes
issued under the Indenture or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and
discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- upon the release of the Guarantor’s guarantee of any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees”; provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time_
Guaranteed by the Guarantor that would result in the requirement that the Guarantor provide
a Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;_

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

- in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”; or

- as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation.”

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested by the
Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance
with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases
set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent without the consent of or
liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee or the Security
Agent.

#### Subordination of the Note Guarantees on the Basis of the Intercreditor Agreement

Each of the Note Guarantees is a senior subordinated Note Guarantee, which means that,
pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each such Note Guarantee ranks behind,
and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the relevant

179


-----

Guarantor, including any obligations owed by the relevant Guarantor under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, certain hedging agreements and any other indebtedness ranking pari passu
therewith incurred after the Issue Date (as well as any future second lien Indebtedness to the
extent permitted to be incurred hereunder). The ability to take enforcement action against the
Guarantors under their Note Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the
Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Note Guarantees, and potentially any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date.

In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain
circumstances, including, but not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security
Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the
foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of the
Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes in any
insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be
insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after
the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. The Note Guarantees will also be subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including payment blockage upon a senior default (or a
second lien default in the event that second lien Indebtedness is incurred in the future) and
standstill on enforcement. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor
Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

#### Principal and Maturity

The Issuer will issue €180.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in the Offering on the
Issue Date. The Notes will mature on, 2025. The Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes
are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any
payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day, and will not be entitled to
any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

#### Interest

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable, in cash,
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2017. The Issuer
will make each interest payment for so long as the Notes are Global Notes to the holders of
record of the Notes at the close of business (in the relevant clearing system) on the Clearing
System Business Day immediately before the due date for such payment, where “Clearing System
Business Day” means a day on which each clearing system for which the Global Note is being held
is open for business, or to the extent Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, to the holders
of record of the Notes on the day immediately preceding and . Interest on the Notes
will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been
paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the
relevant interest payment date.

#### Additional Notes

The Issuer is permitted to issue additional Notes under the Indenture from time to time after the
Offering, having identical terms and conditions as the Notes except for the issue price and the
amount of such issuance (the “Additional Notes”), so long as such issuance is in compliance with
the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of
Indebtedness (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”).
The Notes issued in the Offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single

180


-----

class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers,
amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the
Indenture. The Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the
same series as the original Notes, in some cases may not be fungible with the original Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and will then be allocated a separate ISIN and common code.
Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the
“Notes” include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

#### Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the
Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more
Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or
more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary for
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more
Paying Agents in London, in each case, maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the
Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by check mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown
on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the
_Notes.”_

#### Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes, including a Paying Agent in
London (the “Paying Agent”). The initial Paying Agent for the Notes will be Elavon Financial
Services DAC, UK Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and a transfer agent
(the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial
Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch. The Registrar, Paying Agent and
Transfer Agent, respectively, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive
Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate
transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Transfer Agent shall perform
the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior
notice to the Holders of the Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent
or Registrar in respect of the Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require,
the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent.

#### Transfer and Exchange

The Notes will initially be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest
coupons, as follows:

- the Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”);

- the Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global
_Notes”); and_

181


-----

- the Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be
subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and
described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests
between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules
and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in a 144A Global Note (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note
(“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
effected pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation S. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may
be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made to a person that the transferor reasonably believes is
purchasing the 144A Book-Entry Interests for its own account, or for one or more accounts with
respect to which such person exercises sole investment discretion, and such person and each such
account is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities
Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, and such transfer is in compliance
with any applicable blue sky securities laws of any state of the United States.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest
in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the
Global Note to which it is transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become
subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon
receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other
documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon
directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be
in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In
connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or
exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes,
duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer
or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes, duties and
governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to
treat the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

#### Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption

Concurrently with the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the
Escrow Agreement with, inter alios, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the
Initial Purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross proceeds of
the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be pledged on
a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant
to an escrow charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow
_Charge”). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities,_
interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow
Account (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are
referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.”

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Escrow
_Release”), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer on or prior to the_
Escrow Longstop Date, an Officer’s Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the
Trustee shall be able to rely without further investigation, to the effect that all of the following
conditions have been met or will be satisfied on or prior to the Business Day immediately
following the Escrow Longstop Date:

- the Acquisition is required to be completed on the terms set forth in the FG Acquisition
Agreement promptly following the Escrow Release, except for any changes, waivers or other
modifications that are not, individually or when taken as whole, materially adverse to the
interests of the Holders of the Notes;

- immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, Bidco will own, directly or indirectly, 99%
or more of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Target; and

- as of the delivery date of such Officer’s Certificate, there is no Default or Event of Default with
respect to the Issuer under clauses (6) or (10)(a) of the first paragraph under the heading titled
“Events of Default” below.

The Escrow Release shall occur promptly following receipt of such Officer’s Certificate. Upon the
Escrow Release, the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be
paid out in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Business Day
immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) the Issuer notifies the Trustee and the
Escrow Agent that in its reasonable judgment the Acquisition will not be completed by the
Business Day immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date, (c) the FG Acquisition Agreement
terminates at any time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (d) the Equity Investors cease to
beneficially own and control a majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Issuer
or (e) a Default or Event of Default arises with respect to the Issuer under clause (6) of the first
paragraph under the heading titled “Events of Default” on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date
(the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem all of
the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption
_Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest_
and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date
(as defined below) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Written notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later
than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agreement and the Indenture will provide that the Notes
shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given
by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay, on_

183


-----

behalf of the Issuer, to the Paying Agent for payment to each holder of Notes the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such
Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer.

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory
Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, the Public Sector Pension Investment
Board (directly or indirectly through a wholly owned subsidiary thereof) and one or more
investment funds advised or managed by Partners Group AG will be required, on a several, pro
_rata basis in relation to their respective total equity commitments in UK TopCo, to fund the Issuer_
with an amount sufficient to cover interest accrued and Additional Amounts (if any) due with
respect to the Notes from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date pursuant to
a funding commitment letter delivered to the Issuer by such funds (the “Shortfall Agreement”).

The rights of the Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement will be pledged on a first-ranking basis in
favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.

The holders of the Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the Shortfall Agreement, and
must rely on the Issuer’s sole right to enforcement under the Shortfall Agreement.

Receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of either an Officer’s Certificate for the Escrow Release or
a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for
the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange that
the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such special
mandatory redemption.

#### Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries

As of the Issue Date, the Issuer’s sole subsidiary will be Bidco. As of the Issue Date and as of the
Completion Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In the
circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer
will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

#### The Proceeds Loans

On the Completion Date, the Issuer will lend, pursuant to a proceeds loan in an amount of
approximately €180.0 million (the “Bidco Proceeds Loan”), the gross proceeds of the issuance of
the Notes offered hereby to Bidco, and Bidco will lend, pursuant to a proceeds loan in an
equivalent aggregate principal amount (the “Cerba Proceeds Loan” and, together with the Bidco
Proceeds Loan, the “Proceeds Loans”) such proceeds to Cerba Healthcare S.A.S. (“Cerba”) for the
purpose of redeeming the Existing Notes, repaying certain existing debt of the Target Group and
paying associated costs and expenses. It is anticipated that funds received by the Issuer and Bidco
as payments of interest under the Proceeds Loans will be used to service a portion of the interest
payments under the Notes (in the case of the Cerba Proceeds Loan, until Cerba is merged with
Bidco, as described in this Offering Memorandum). In addition, Subsidiaries of the Issuer may
upstream further funds as needed by means of dividends or loans.

#### Security

**_The Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the obligations under the Indenture will be secured by a firstpriority security interest over the Escrowed Property deposited in the Escrow Account and the
rights of the Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement (collectively the “Escrow Collateral”). See “—
_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The Escrowed Property that is deposited in_
the Escrow Account and the rights of the Issuer under the Shortfall Agreement will not be
charged to secure any obligations other than the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the

184


-----

Indenture. Upon the definitive release of the Escrowed Property, the first-priority security
interests over the Escrowed Property will be released. In addition, on the Issue Date, the Notes
will be secured by a first-ranking pledge over the shares of the Issuer held by TopCo and a
second-ranking pledge over the shares in Bidco held by the Issuer.

On the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by a second-ranking pledge over the
receivables owed to the Issuer by Bidco in respect of the Bidco Proceeds Loan.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary therein, the Indenture will provide that any
obligation to accede a Restricted Subsidiary to the Indenture as a Guarantor or to pledge assets
as Collateral will be limited pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, which refer to the
following considerations, among others:

- if providing such security or guarantee would be prohibited by general legal or statutory
limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalisation,” “earnings
stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control
restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions,
retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles
may limit the ability of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to provide a guarantee or security
or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so,
the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly, provided that, to the extent requested by
the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and
without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or
otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- if the time and cost of providing the guarantee or security is not proportionate to the benefit
accruing to the holders of the Notes, then such guarantee or security shall not be given or
taken;

- Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents
if they are not wholly owned by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (as relevant) or if
such guarantee or security would be outside the legal capacity of the Issuer or another
Restricted Subsidiary (as relevant) or conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of directors
or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have
the potential to result in material risk of personal or criminal liability of any director or officer
of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary after the use of reasonable endeavours (but without
incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to
overcome such obstacles;

- if the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes relating to the provision of
security exceeds an amount to be agreed between the Issuer and Natixis as agent under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, then such security shall not be taken;

- if a class of assets includes material and immaterial assets and the cost involved in creating
security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit, only the material assets
in that category will be subject to security;

- if it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of assets,
security will not be taken over such assets;

- if providing such security requires consent before such assets may be secured, or where
providing such security would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any
rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
respect of those assets or require any of them to take any action materially adverse to the
interests of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any member thereof and where (subject to
certain conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable
endeavors, security will not be taken over such assets;

185


-----

- if providing such security or granting such guarantee would have a material adverse effect on
the ability of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary (as relevant) to conduct its operations and
business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Indenture, then such guarantee
or security shall not be given or taken and any requirement under the Agreed Security
Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to
this principle;

- if security over such assets or guarantee from such person is required to support acquired
indebtedness to the extent such indebtedness is permitted by the Indenture to remain
outstanding after an acquisition or if the terms of the documentation governing such acquired
indebtedness prevents the granting of such security or guarantee, then such guarantee or
security shall not be given or taken;

- if the assets are located outside the security jurisdictions, which are Belgium, France,
Luxembourg and any member of the European Economic Area or Switzerland (the “Security
_Jurisdictions”), security will not be taken over such assets;_

- no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions which are not Security Jurisdictions;

- in the case of security from or guarantees over, or over assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not wholly owned by
another Restricted Subsidiary, then such guarantee or security shall not be given or taken;

- certain notifications, deliverables and other notices will only be provided at the request of the
Security Agent and at intervals no more frequent than annually (unless required more
frequently under local law); and

- in the case of assets subject to security which is a Permitted Lien, unless specifically required by
the Indenture to the contrary, security will not be taken.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—No Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on_
_Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future_
issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any
Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness.”

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interest in the Collateral (other than the Escrow
Collateral) as between (a) the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the creditors of
certain future indebtedness that is pari passu with the Senior Facilities Agreement, (b) the
counterparties under certain hedging obligations, (c) the holders of the Notes, (d) the Issuer,
Bidco, and the Guarantors and (e) the Trustee and the Security Agent and (f) future second lien
Indebtedness (to the extent permitted to be incurred hereunder) is established by the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Security Documents, the security documents
relating to the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations, which provide,
among other things, that the obligations under the Notes and the Indenture will receive
proceeds on enforcement of security over the Collateral (other than the Escrow Collateral) only
after the claims of the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedging counterparties and creditors
under any future Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a first-ranking basis in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement are satisfied (and creditors
under future second lien indebtedness (to the extent permitted to be incurred)). See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor_
Agreement entered into on the Issue Date (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered
into after the Issue Date), the Collateral (other than the Escrow Collateral) may be pledged to
secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

186


-----

#### Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each
case pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement for
the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. The enforcement of the Security Documents will
be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various
bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Issuer’s bankruptcy. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—In certain jurisdictions, security_
_over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of_
_the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local_
_law,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France_
_and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the_
_United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on_
_the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_
_adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral_
will be limited to the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply
with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the
enforceable amounts of the Issuer’s obligation under the Notes could be significantly less than
the total amounts payable with respect to the Notes. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—In certain jurisdictions, security_
_over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of_
_the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local_
_law.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in
possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral, to freely operate the Collateral and to
collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

The rights of the Security Agent (acting on its behalf or on behalf of the holders of the Notes) to
take enforcement action under the Security Documents in respect of the Collateral are subject to
certain standstill provisions and other limitations on enforcement pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in
connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the
sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the
Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time, if at all.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to
cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or
all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or certain other competitive
sales processes or only at a price confirmed by a valuation, subject to certain exceptions. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Trustee has, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as Security Agent, to act as its agent under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including,
without limitation, the Security Documents);

187


-----

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights,
powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or
other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents),
together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each
document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be
executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee
to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement
overrides any provisions in the Indenture and to the extent that any step or action is permitted
under the Intercreditor Agreement, it will be deemed permitted under the Indenture.

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent will take any action required to effectuate any release of Collateral required
by a Security Document under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes
issued under the Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof as provided in “—Defeasance”
and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee in accordance with the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets and Capital Stock of such Guarantor;

(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral (other than dispositions of Collateral
consisting of the issued share capital of the Issuer), directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person other
than the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries if such disposition is permitted by the
Indenture or (b) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that in the case of this clause
(b) subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the relevant Collateral becomes reasonably promptly
subject to a substantially equivalent Lien over the same Collateral securing the Notes;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—No Impairment
_of Security Interest”;_

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the
Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in “—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation”; provided that in such a transaction where the Issuer or any Guarantor ceases_
to exist, the Lien on the Capital Stock of the Issuer or such Guarantor will be released and,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will reattach (or a new Lien will be created) over the
Capital Stock of the successor entity pursuant to a new share pledge (on terms substantially
equivalent to the existing Lien on the Capital Stock of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable)
granted by the holder of such Capital Stock;

(7) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of Liens on property and
assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(8) as otherwise provided in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(9) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent it is necessary,
the Trustee without the consent of the Holders.

#### Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements

In connection with the (1) Incurrence of any Senior Indebtedness, any Indebtedness by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is permitted to share in the Collateral or permitted to be

188


-----

Incurred under the first paragraph or clause (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (11) (12), or (16) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
or (2) any Indebtedness the proceeds of which are used, in whole or in part, to refinance
Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at
the request of the Issuer, enter into with the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries and the
holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) one or more intercreditor
agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification
of the Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially
similar terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not materially less favorable to
the Holders) with respect to sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of security,
priority, release of security, turnover, limitation on enforcement and other rights contained in
the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or adversely affect the personal
rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent
under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Issuer
shall furnish to the Trustee and Security Agent such documentation in relation thereto as it may
reasonably require.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Trustee shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase,
defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes
thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described
herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the
consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent or any other relevant creditor
representative or collateral agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or
types of Indebtedness covered by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes
(provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (3) add
Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make
provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or to
implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (6) to facilitate a Permitted Reorganization otherwise
permitted by the Indenture or (7) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders of Notes in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct
the Trustee or Security Agent or any other relevant creditor representative or collateral agent to
enter into any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and
_Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional_
Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter
into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations
on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely
affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security
Agent and any other relevant creditor representative or collateral agent to enter into the

189


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any restatement,
replacement, amendment or other modification to reflect the above on each Holder’s behalf and
neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent will be required to seek the consent of the Holders to
perform its obligations under and in accordance with the above provisions. The Intercreditor
Agreement overrides any provisions in the Indenture and to the extent that any step or action is
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, it will be deemed permitted under the Indenture.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be
made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available for inspection during
normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the office of the Issuer
and, for so long as any Notes are admitted for trading on the Exchange, at the offices of the
Listing Sponsor for the Notes.

#### Optional Redemption

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are not
redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its
option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject
to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date).

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in
whole or in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price
equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the rights of
Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on of the years
indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the Notes upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice with the net cash proceeds received by the
Issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to % plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the
rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date), in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed
40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes),
_provided that:_

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the
related Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes being redeemed
(including the principal amount of any Additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately
thereafter.

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion
thereof.

**_General_**

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent (including, without limitation, in the case of a

190


-----

redemption related to an Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering and, in the
case of a redemption of the Notes, the incurrence of Indebtedness the proceeds of which will be
used to redeem the Notes). In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or
such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date
so delayed; provided, however, that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10
days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are
listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the
rules of the Exchange so require, inform the Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after
such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the
related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no
additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the
Issuer.

Subject to compliance with the covenants contained herein, and provided that no Default is
triggered thereby, the Issuer and its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase
Notes. Any such purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated
transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or
otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuer or
any such Affiliates may determine.

In connection with any tender offer for the Notes at a price of at least 100.000% of the principal
amount of the Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the
applicable tender settlement date, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of
the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the
Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the
Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal
to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not
included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding, such redemption date.

#### Sinking Fund

Other than a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer will not be required to make mandatory
redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

#### Selection and Notice

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Notes will be selected on a pro
_rata basis for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities_
exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee or the Registrar, as
applicable, by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream,
or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the
Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribe no
method of selection, on a pro rata basis in respect of the Notes; provided, however, that no Note

191


-----

of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only in integral
multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar will be liable for any
selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted for trading on
the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, any such notice to the Holders of the
relevant Notes shall to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules be posted on the
official website of the Exchange and in addition to such release, not less than 10 days nor more
than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer will mail, or at the expense of the Issuer,
cause to be mailed, such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective
addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption
may instead be posted on the website of the Exchange.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note
shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion
of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the
original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to
decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.
Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained
therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption (as delayed
from time to time pursuant to such notice). On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

#### Redemption for Taxation Reasons

The Issuer or Successor Issuer, as defined below, may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part,
at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders of the
Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date
fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date that is prior to
the Tax Redemption Date) and all Additional Amounts (see “—Withholding Taxes”), then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or
otherwise, if any, if the Issuer, Successor Issuer or relevant Guarantor determine in good faith
that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings
(including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer, Successor Issuer or relevant Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in
respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer, Successor Issuer or
relevant Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying
Agent where this would be reasonable and not result in any material legal or regulatory burden
or any significant additional costs but not including assignment of the obligation to make
payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a
Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of this
Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of
this Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a
Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of
this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date
the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax Law would have
applied to the predecessor of the Successor Issuer. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will

192


-----

be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be obligated to
make such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due
and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts
remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or Successor Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s
Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of
facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and
that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking
reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of
recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer, Successor Issuer or relevant Guarantor has or
have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax
Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event
it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Successor Issuer is
incorporated or organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or
therein.

#### Withholding Taxes

All payments made by the Issuer, a Successor Issuer or relevant Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the
Notes or any Note Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is
then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed
or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Note Guarantee is
made by a Payor or the Paying Agent, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for
tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental
Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant
_Taxing Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required from any payments made by a Payor with respect to any Note or any
Note Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest,
the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional
_Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such_
payments by the Holders after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or
withholding from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been
received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Note or any Note Guarantee in
the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional
Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant
Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee,
trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a
permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding
of such Note or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

193


-----

(2) any Taxes to the extent that they are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor
addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information,
documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or
such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from,
or reduction in the rate of withholding or deduction of, all or part of such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of
the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or any Note Guarantees;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, value added, use, excise, transfer, personal property or
similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a Holder or beneficial owner
who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise
accepting payment from, another paying agent;

(6) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or
successor version of such Sections), any U.S. Treasury regulations or other official guidance
promulgated thereunder, any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection
therewith, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement
between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to any of the foregoing or any
agreements entered into pursuant to section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(7) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made
without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note
for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the
relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the
beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been
entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any Taxes imposed on or with
respect to a payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or other than the sole
beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such
payment had such Holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Note.

The Payor will (i) make any withholding or deduction it is required to make under applicable law
and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted
or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided
in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the
Issuer and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies
shall be made available by the Issuer to the Holders upon request.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment
made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the
Payor will deliver to the Trustee, with a copy to the Paying Agent, an Officer’s Certificate stating
the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the
relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days
prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate
as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee
and Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof
that such payments are necessary.

194


-----

Wherever in either the Indenture, any Note Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there
are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under
this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be
payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other
property or similar taxes, charges or levies that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture, the Security
Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer of the
Notes), and the Payor agrees to reimburse the Holders for any such taxes paid by such Holders,
except where Luxembourg registration duties (droits d’enregistrement) arise or are due in
relation to the registration of any Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto with the Administration de l’enregistrement et des
_domaines in Luxembourg, where such registration is made on a purely voluntary basis by the_
Holders (i.e. where such registration is not necessary for the perfection, protection or
enforcement of their rights in respect of the Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any
other document or instrument in relation thereto). The foregoing obligations of this paragraph
will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis
_mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Successor Issuer is organized or any political subdivision_
or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

#### Change of Control

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to
require the Issuer to repurchase all or part (in integral multiples of €1,000; provided that Notes of
€100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however,
that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Notes as described under this “Change of
_Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to_
redeem all of the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such
redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described
under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a
notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the
Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right
to require the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on
the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days
from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

195


-----

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a
Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect
of all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of
Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global
Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each
Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes,
and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to
be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in
aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any;
_provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least_
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the
Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other
provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of
Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the
Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar
transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s
Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to
acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of
Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, or an offer or other
transaction that if consummated would result in a Change of Control has been publicly
announced and, if applicable, not withdrawn, at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on

196


-----

which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this
covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange
rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

The occurrence of a change of control would entitle each lender under the Senior Facilities
Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts
outstanding to it under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Future debt of the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or
provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes
could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of
Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Issuer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third
party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of
the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will
have the right, upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (provided that
such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer described above) to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus,
to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of
Control may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of
the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to finance a
_change of control offer.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the
property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified
other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or
assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred
and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
described above. In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders”
expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified
Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent
of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the
Indenture.

#### Certain Covenants

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of
such Incurrence after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the

197


-----

proceeds thereof) as if the additional Indebtedness had been Incurred at the beginning of such
four quarter period, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer’s most recently
ended four fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred is at
least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following
Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (a) the sum of (i) €1,075.0 million and
(ii) the greater of €160.0 million and 100.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (b) the maximum
amount of Indebtedness such that after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the
Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio of Bidco does not exceed 5.50 to 1.00 (with any
Indebtedness Incurred under clause (a)(ii) hereof on the date of determination of the
Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the revolving
portion of such Credit Facility on such date) not being included in the calculation of Consolidated
Net Secured Leverage Ratio under this clause (b) on such date (but not, for the avoidance of
doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any subsequent date)) plus (c) in the case of
any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof,
including the aggregate amount of fees, accrued and unpaid interest, underwriting discounts,
premiums and other costs (including redemption premia and defeasance costs) and expenses
Incurred in connection with such refinancing; provided that any Indebtedness Incurred and
outstanding pursuant to this clause (1) shall be deemed to be Secured Indebtedness (whether or
not so secured) solely for the purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Secured Leverage
Ratio pursuant to clause (1)(b) above;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness being Guaranteed is
permitted under the terms of the Indenture; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness
arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness
of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is
permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of
a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

(a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor under such Indebtedness and the obligee is
not the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and, if the aggregate principal
amount of such Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness that is outstanding for a period of
less than 90 days) of the Issuer or such Guarantor to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor exceeds the greater of (i) €20.0 million and (ii) 12.5% of Consolidated EBITDA, ((i)
except in respect of the intercompany current liabilities Incurred in connection with the cash
management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only to the
extent legally permitted (the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all
procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or
obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection
with the subordination of such Indebtedness)) expressly subordinated in right of payment
(including as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) to the prior payment in full in cash of the Notes (whether upon Stated Maturity,
acceleration or otherwise); and

198


-----

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness
to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed, in
each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and any
Guarantee thereof, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in the first
paragraph of this covenant or in clauses (1) and (3) of this paragraph) existing (i) on the Issue
Date, in the case of the Issuer and Bidco, and (ii) on the Completion Date, in the case of the
Target Group, after giving effect to the Transactions, (c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in
respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) or clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, (d) the Guarantees of and Liens granted with
respect to the Notes from time to time and any “parallel debt” obligations created under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable security
documents with respect to the Notes or any other Indebtedness the Incurrence of which is
permitted under the terms of the Indenture, and (e) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (a) Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or is
merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any
acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
or (b) Incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate any such
acquisition, merger, amalgamation or combination (including any such acquisition of assets and
assumption of related liabilities); provided, however, with respect to each of clause (5)(a) and
(5)(b), that at the time of such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
transaction either (i) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after giving effect to the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness (including application of the proceeds thereof) pursuant to this clause (5) or (ii) the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer after giving effect to the Incurrence of
such Indebtedness (including application of the proceeds thereof) pursuant to this clause
(5) would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other
transaction and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by an Officer or the
Board of Directors of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness of the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries represented by Capitalized
Lease Obligations, Purchase Money Obligations, or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of
financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of
property, plant or equipment used in a Similar Business or Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to
finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of
property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether
through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets and
in each case any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any
time the greater of (i) € 60.0 million and (ii) 38% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax
or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion
guarantees and warranties provided by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to

199


-----

liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in respect of
any governmental requirement, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other
similar instruments or obligations supporting trade payables or issued or relating to other
liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business (including, without limitation,
in connection with commercial leases) or in respect of any governmental requirement; provided,
_however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or similar instruments, the obligations_
are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing, (c) the financing of insurance premiums
in the ordinary course of business, (d) any customary netting or setting off arrangements in the

otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock,
Designated Preference Shares, an Excluded Contribution or Excluded Amounts) of the Issuer, in
each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds
that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments
under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant
described below under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that

(15) Indebtedness consisting of guarantees of Indebtedness incurred by joint ventures of the

paragraph of this covenant and clause (1)(b) and (11) of the second paragraph of this covenant
shall not exceed at any time outstanding an amount equal to the greater of € 75.0 million and
50.0% of Consolidated EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any
particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the
criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second
paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to
time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type
of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this
covenant. With respect to clauses (7), (11), (13)(ii) and (16) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, if at any time that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to have
Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness as pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

201


-----

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred on the Completion Date under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall
be deemed Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant
and may not be reclassified and all Indebtedness of the Target Group existing on the Completion
Date after giving effect to the Transactions (which is expected to be in an aggregate principal
amount of approximately €107.3 million) shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1) of the second

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other

under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) relating to, or
Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause
(1), (7), (11), (12) or (16) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the
letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness,
then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof
will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(8) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness
Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash
sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under any such Credit Facility that
provide that Indebtedness is to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this
covenant, at the option of the Issuer, to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was
first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof and shall be deemed if
such option is exercised to remain Incurred and outstanding as Indebtedness under the first or
second paragraph of this covenant, as applicable;

(9) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of
such Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and
unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs,
indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with
such refinancing;

(10) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments
under a revolving Credit Facility, obtains any commitment for Indebtedness or commits to Incur
any Lien pursuant to clause (25) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the incurrence or issuance
thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of
calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (16) of the
preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the
Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving Credit Facility or such
entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been Incurred
as Indebtedness as of such date) or other Indebtedness, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
the Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as

202


-----

applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time,
any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing
or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder)
(the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed on a date pursuant to the
operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for
purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding
as Indebtedness under the first or second paragraph of this covenant, as applicable) or (b) be
determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased
commitment, and in each case, the Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from
time to time; and

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at
the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA
restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the
date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be
deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does
not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or
Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as
Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for
purposes of the covenant described under this caption “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The
amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as specified under the
definition of “Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such
date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term
Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness
Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing
would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such eurodenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the euro equivalent of the aggregate
principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so
long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in
which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness,
the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal

203


-----

payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the euro
equivalent of such amount plus the euro equivalent of any premium which is at such time due
and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

For purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” under this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA
shall be measured for the Issuer’s most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal
consolidated financial statements are available as at the time that the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries obtains new commitments (in the case of revolving facilities) or Incurs new
Indebtedness (in the case of term facilities or other Indebtedness).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed
to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal
amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different
currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in
connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment or other similar
transaction where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence
(including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness, Restricted Payments and Permitted
Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of
Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such
acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment or similar transaction are entered into
and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment, or similar transaction and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the
applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such
transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for
the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of
fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the
Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have
been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the
transaction is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time
of consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer
elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any
such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof)
shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture
after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s or any
Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified
Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the Issuer or
in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case
of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders of its
Capital Stock other than the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro
_rata basis, measured by value);_

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any
direct or indirect Parent of the Issuer held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than in exchange for Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital
Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise
acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled
sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment,
purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in
anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in
each case, due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or
other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or
otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other than any
payment of interest or premium thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder
Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(any such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other
acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) are referred
to herein as a “Restricted Payment”), if at the time the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes
such Restricted Payment:

(a) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter
therefrom);

(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause
(1) of the first paragraph under the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant after giving
effect, on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments
made subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted
Payments permitted below by clauses (5), (10) and (17) of the third paragraph of this
covenant, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the third paragraph of
this covenant) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period)
from the first day of the first fiscal quarter commencing after the Issue Date to the end
of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such Restricted Payment for
which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available (or, in the
case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined
in accordance with the next paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities,
received by the Issuer from the issue or sale of its Capital Stock (other than the Equity

Shareholder Funding subsequent to the Issue Date or otherwise contributed to the
equity (other than through the Equity Contribution or the issuance of Disqualified Stock
or Designated Preference Shares) of the Issuer subsequent to the Issue Date (other than
(x) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received from an
issuance or sale of such Capital Stock to a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock
ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the

benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
(y) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities to the extent that
any Restricted Payment has been made from such proceeds in reliance on clause (6) of
the third paragraph of this covenant and (z) Excluded Contributions);

in accordance with the second succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or
marketable securities, received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
issuance or sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or an
employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the
Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Issue
Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of
the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the fair market
value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or
assets or marketable securities, received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary upon
such conversion or exchange);

(iv) the amount equal to the net reduction in Restricted Investments made by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries resulting from:

(A) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions or retirements of any such
Restricted Investment by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and the Net Cash
Proceeds realized upon (or the fair market value, as determined in accordance with
the next paragraph, of property, assets or marketable securities received in
connection with) the sale or other disposition to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of any such Restricted Investment, repayments of loans or
advances or other transfers of assets (including by way of dividend, distribution,
interest payments or returns of capital) to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(B) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries or the
merger or consolidation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (valued at the fair market value of the Issuer’s Restricted
Investment in such Subsidiary) or the transfer of all of the assets of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (valued at the fair market value of
the property received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), which amount, in
each case under this clause (c)(iv), was included in the calculation of the amount of
Restricted Payments referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c); provided,
_however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes_
of the preceding clause (c)(i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included
under this clause (c)(iv); plus

(v) the amount of the cash and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with
the next paragraph) of property or assets or of marketable securities received by the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with:

(A) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any
Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of

-----

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of_
the preceding clause (c)(i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included under the
foregoing clause (c)(v).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that
would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments
pursuant to sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent
(1) such amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable
securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise
constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof were it not a Specified Change
of Control Event, (2) the purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds,
property or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of
the Issuer so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that
would not have been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets
or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in connection with such
event in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture.

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence
shall be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by an Officer or the Board of
Directors of the Issuer.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted
_Payments”):_

(1) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the
substantially concurrent sale or issuance of, Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than the Equity
Contribution, Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or Excluded Amounts),
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (in
each case, other than (i) to a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust
established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the
extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) through the Equity Contribution or
the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or through an Excluded
Contribution or Excluded Amounts and (iii) to the extent that any Restricted Payment has been
made from such proceeds in reliance on clause (6) below) of the Issuer; provided, however, that
to the extent so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value (as determined in
accordance with the preceding sentence) of property or assets or of marketable securities, from
such sale of Capital Stock, Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be
excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the preceding paragraph;

(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of
Subordinated Indebtedness made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially
concurrent sale of, Refinancing Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” above;

(3) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of
Preferred Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary made by exchange for or out of the
proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of Preferred Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, that, in each case, is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” above, and that in each case,
constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness;

(4) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of
Subordinated Indebtedness:

(a) from Net Available Cash to the extent permitted under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets
_and Subsidiary Stock” below, but only if (i) the Issuer shall have first complied with the terms_
described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and purchased all
Notes tendered pursuant to any offer to repurchase all the Notes required thereby, prior to
purchasing, repurchasing, redeeming, defeasing or otherwise acquiring or retiring such

Subordinated Indebtedness and (ii) at a purchase price not greater than 100% of the
principal amount of such Subordinated Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest;

(b) to the extent required by the agreement governing such Subordinated Indebtedness,
following the occurrence of a Change of Control (or other similar event described therein as
a “change of control”), but only (i) if the Issuer shall have first complied with the terms
described under “—Change of Control” and purchased all Notes tendered pursuant to the
offer to repurchase all the Notes required thereby, prior to purchasing, repurchasing,
redeeming, defeasing or otherwise acquiring or retiring such Subordinated Indebtedness and
(ii) at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Subordinated
Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest; or

(c) (i) consisting of Acquired Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred (A) to provide
all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise
acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or (B) otherwise in connection with or
contemplation of such acquisition) and (ii) at a purchase price not greater than 100% of the
principal amount of such Subordinated Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest and
any premium required by the terms of any Acquired Indebtedness;

Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any such
dividend, distribution, loan or other payment does not exceed 4.50 to 1.0 or, if such dividend,
distribution, loan or other payment is funded from the “retained excess cash” of the Issuer (or

of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of calculation.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the
date of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or
issued by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted
Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the
fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by an
Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith. For purposes hereof,
unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinate or junior to Indebtedness that is
secured by virtue of it not being secured.

For purposes of the covenant described above, if any Investment or Restricted Payment would be
permitted pursuant to one or more provisions described above and/or one or more of the
exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” the Issuer may divide and
classify such Investment or Restricted Payment in any manner that complies with this covenant
and, except for clause (17) of the second paragraph of this covenant, may later divide and
reclassify any such Investment or Restricted Payment so long as the Investment or Restricted
Payment (as so divided and/or reclassified) would be permitted to be made in reliance on the
applicable exception as of the date of such reclassification. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer
or its Restricted Subsidiaries may not reclassify any other Restricted Payment or Permitted
Investment as having been permitted under clause (17) of the second paragraph of this covenant.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date,
or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any
Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that
does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not
Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture are directly secured (subject to the Agreed
Security Principles) equally and ratably with, or prior or senior to, in the case of Liens with respect
to Subordinated Indebtedness, or junior to, in the case of Liens in respect of Senior Indebtedness

210


-----

(provided that such Liens rank equal with all other Liens on such property or assets securing
Senior Indebtedness), the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—
_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens—Release of Liens.”_

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness
at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure
any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall
mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest,
the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of
interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue
discount or liquidation preference, in each case with respect to such Indebtedness, and increases
in the amount of Indebtedness resulting solely from fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies.

**_Limitation on Layered Debt_**

The Issuer will not incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any
Indebtedness that is or purports by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such
Indebtedness) to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of
the Issuer unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes on substantially identical terms.

The Issuer will not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor will, incur, create, issue, assume,
guarantee or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness that is or purports by its terms (or by
the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) to be contractually subordinated or
junior in right of payment to Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor and senior in right of
payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. No such Indebtedness will be considered to be
contractually subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of any
Guarantor by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or
by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different
tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock held
by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to
the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating_
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and
(y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or
advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or
restriction.

211


-----

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior
Facilities Agreement), (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and related security documents and the Security Documents or (c) any
other agreement in effect on (i) the Issue Date, in the case of the Issuer and (ii) the Completion
Date, in the case of the Target Group after giving effect to the Transactions;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or
relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on
which such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which
such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration
in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series
of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding
on such date;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a
refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or
instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial
_Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an_
agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however,
that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in
any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders
taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or
Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification
relates (as determined in good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or
transfer of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted
under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of
the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security
agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized
Lease Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired in the nature of clause (c) of the preceding paragraph or
any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions
on the transfer or distribution of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property
or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or
disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

212


-----

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar
agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses,
concessions, franchises or permits, including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits
(including assets in escrow accounts);

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
or suppliers, or as required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities, in each
case, under agreements or policies entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements
or Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to
any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole
are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect
on the Completion Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer or an Officer thereof) or (B) the Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material
respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation
_on Liens”;_

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing, that, in the good
faith determination of an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer, are necessary or
advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing; or

(14) customary restrictions included in shareholder agreements relating to non-Wholly Owned
Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be
determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in
good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer, of the shares and assets subject
to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash
Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary within 395 days from the later of (A) the date of such
Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, as the case may be:

213


-----

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary),

(i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Senior Indebtedness, or any Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(ii) to redeem, prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more
than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of such redemption, prepayment, repayment or purchase
plus a premium over par no greater than the premium offered to the Holders of Notes in
the pro rata offer described in the following proviso, if applicable; provided that the
Issuer shall redeem, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt
pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or subsequently in
compliance with this covenant) an offer to all Holders of the Notes to purchase their
Notes at a purchase price equal to or greater than 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase
and/or pursuant to the redemption provisions set forth above under the caption “—
_Optional Redemption” on a pro rata basis with any such other Pari Passu Indebtedness_
that is purchased; or

(iii) to redeem, prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is secured by a Lien on property or assets of the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than a Permitted Collateral Lien);

(b) to redeem Notes or purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders at a purchase price
equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest (at
the option of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary) and/or pursuant to the redemption
provisions set forth above under the caption “—Optional Redemption”;

(c) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary); provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made
pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment that is executed within such
time will satisfy this requirement so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days
following the expiration of the aforementioned 395-day period; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness (including revolving Indebtedness) or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in
any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph within the applicable time period will
be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. Within 10 Business Days after
the expiration of the applicable time period, or at such earlier date that the Issuer elects, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds €30.0 million, the Issuer will
be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under the
Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to purchase (or, if applicable, repay or prepay) the maximum aggregate principal
amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer
applies that may be purchased (or, if applicable, repaid or prepaid) out of the Excess Proceeds, at
an offer price in respect of the Notes equal to or greater than 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes and at an offer price in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness of no more than 100%
of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus a premium over par no greater than
the premium offered to the Holders of Notes in the Asset Disposition Offer, in each case plus

214


-----

accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (or, if applicable,
repayment or prepayment), in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the
agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the
applicable time period referred to above.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the
Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate
purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to
be purchased (or, if applicable, repaid or prepaid) on a pro rata basis on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of
calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro,
such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into
their euro equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset
Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the
amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated,
the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of
not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer
_Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer_
Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase (or, if applicable, repay or
prepay) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu
Indebtedness required to be purchased (or, if applicable, repaid or prepaid) pursuant to this
covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in
response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less
than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn,
all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions
thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant.
The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than
five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each
tendering Holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase,
and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee, upon
delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate (via an authenticating agent)
and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in
an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered;
_provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum_

215


-----

denomination of € 100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or
transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be
deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release
of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection
with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash
or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition; provided that such Indebtedness is not, directly or indirectly, secured by any Lien on
any of the assets or property of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including Capital Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer);

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) received after the Issue Date from
Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) €20.0 million and (ii) 12.5% of Consolidated EBITDA
of the Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date of calculation (with the fair market
value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and

(6) any Capital Stock or assets of a kind referred to in clause (3)(c) of the first paragraph of this
covenant.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on
which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the
Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange
rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase,
sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit
of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions, “Affiliate
_Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €7.5 million and 5.0% of_
Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in
a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;

216


-----

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€25.0 million and 16% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been
approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer; and

(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€50.0 million and 32% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer has received a written opinion (a
“Fairness Opinion”) from an Independent Financial Advisor that such Affiliate Transaction is fair,
from a financial standpoint, to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or that the terms are not
materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a comparable
transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause

through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments
pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the
Completion Date after giving effect to the Transactions (including, without limitation, any
transactions described under the caption “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions”

modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with
the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any

than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently

disclosure that complies in all material respects with the requirements applicable to such item in
connection with an annual report (rapport financier annuel or document de référence) filed with
the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) or the relevant authority of any Member State

respect to such item;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Issuer and within 75 days (or in the case of the four months ending June 30, 2017 only, within 90

_provided further, that such quarterly reports for the four months ending June 30, 2017 and the_
fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 shall include corresponding quarterly reports for Cerba
for the fiscal quarters ending on such dates; and provided further, that, if and for so long as the
Issuer’s shares or the shares of any Parent would be listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange
or any stock exchange established in a Member State of the European Union and there is a Public
Market for such shares, any item of disclosure that complies in all material respects with the
requirements applicable to such item in connection with a semi-annual report (rapport financier
_semestriel) filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) or the relevant authority_
of any Member State of the European Union will be deemed to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations
under this clause (2) with respect to such item; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any
senior executive officer changes at the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer or any other
material event that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report
containing a description of such event provided, that, if and for so long as the Issuer’s shares or
the shares of any Parent would be listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange or any stock
exchange established in a Member State of the European Union and there is a Public Market for
such shares, any item of disclosure that complies in all material respects with the requirements
applicable to such item in connection with ongoing disclosures (information permanent) filed
with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) or the relevant authority of any Member
State of the European Union will be deemed to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under this clause
(3) with respect to such item.

All financial statement shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier
periods on a basis that applied to such periods. All pro forma financial information shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies of the Issuer (or other reporting
entity, as applicable). Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial
statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer. The filing of an Annual Report on Form 20-F within
the time period specified in clause (1) will satisfy such provision.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary,
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial
information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include
either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in
the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial

220


-----

statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a
group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of
the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenues,
EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholders equity, capital expenditures and
interest expense.

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant shall be made in the English language or with a
free English translation.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1),
(2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained
by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability
of such reports (as determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Issuer
determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in
the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable
efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the
Notes. The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3)
of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so
require, at the offices of the Listing Sponsor.

The Issuer may satisfy its obligations and the requirements of this covenant with respect to
financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to any
Parent consolidating reporting at its level in a manner consistent with that described in this
covenant or (but only for periods prior to January 1, 2019), by furnishing financial information
relating to Cerba; provided that such financial information is accompanied by consolidating
information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating
to such Parent (or, if applicable, Cerba) and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the
Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective
purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports”
covenant is for information purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute
actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, include the Issuer’s
compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or
substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state
of the European Union or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the
Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed
and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of
the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the
Security Documents (and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement);

221


-----

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that
becomes an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result
of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Issuer would be
able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “— Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Issuer or the Successor Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal
quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which
the transaction is consummated would not be less than the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture (if any are required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture
and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s
Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3) above.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of
the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Issuer under the Indenture (with the release of the Issuer from any and all
obligations thereunder) but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the
predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under such Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—
_Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and, other than_
with respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first paragraph of this
covenant, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with,
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions
referred to in this sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into
or transfer all or a portion of its assets to an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose
of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or
changing the legal form of the Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which
do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or
otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any
Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a
Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary of the Issuer that becomes a parent
of one or more of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries.

222


-----

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person;
or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless

(a) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes
a Guarantor substantially concurrently with the transaction;

(b) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of
the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and the Security Documents (and, to the extent
required by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor Agreement); and immediately after
giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation
or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of
the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary under this “—Merger and Consolidation”
covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into
or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor or the Issuer and (b) any
Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to any other Guarantor or the Issuer. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary under this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant, a Guarantor may consolidate or
otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of
changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor, reincorporating the Guarantor in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Guarantor. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer or a Guarantor) may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other such
Restricted Subsidiary.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a
Person.

This “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant will not apply to any transaction or arrangement
pursuant to (i) any Permitted Reorganization or (ii) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary
of the Issuer in order to comply with any law, rule, regulation or order, recommendation or
direction of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Issuer and/
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitations to Holding Company Activities_**

and other activities that are de minimis in nature,

_provided that the Issuer is required to own 100% of the Capital Stock of Bidco except for any_
Capital Stock required by law to be held by third parties.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture
summarized under the following captions will not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on Restrictions on_
_Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—_
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Additional Guarantees,” “—Limitations to_
_Holding Company Activities” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the_
covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer,” and, in each case, any
related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will
again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be
in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer
properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of_
such Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason

225


-----

of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all
Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the
Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second
paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred
thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the
Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness
would not be so permitted to be Incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Completion Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition,
the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future
after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the
contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation
of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status.

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Holders that the two conditions set forth in the first
paragraph under this heading have been satisfied, provided that such notification shall not be a
condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall
not be obligated to notify Holders of such event.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an investment grade
rating.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to
(x) Guarantee any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor under any Credit Facilities, or
(y) Guarantee any Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor, and, in each case, any refinancing
thereof incurred by the Issuer or a Guarantor in whole or in part (which refinancing in turn
consists of Credit Facilities or Public Debt, as applicable), unless (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles) such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such other
Guarantee or other Indebtedness, as applicable, is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and
delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant
to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee of the Notes, which Note
Guarantee will be subordinated to any Senior Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary.

A Non-Guarantor Subsidiary may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee of the Notes.

Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable
reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted
Subsidiary to Guarantee the Notes to the extent the Agreed Security Principles so provide or to
the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee could reasonably be
expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law or regulation; (2) any
liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary
that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses Incurred in connection with any

226


-----

governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause
(1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection with, such Note Guarantee, which in any case
under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph cannot be avoided through measures
reasonably available to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) an inconsistency with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_No Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any
action that would have the result of materially impairing any security interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, the
implementation of any Permitted Reorganization and the repayment or amendment of
intragroup Indebtedness of the Issuer, Bidco and their respective Subsidiaries in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair any security interest
with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall
not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and Bidco shall not grant to any Person
other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the
covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens”; provided that the Issuer, Bidco and their respective
Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged,
transferred or released in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the applicable Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of
any security interest in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or released (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets or, in the case of a Permitted Reorganization, assets with
substantially similar value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or Senior
Management of the Issuer) to the Lien that was in place immediately prior to such release) to
(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted
Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change thereto that does not
adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that, except where
permitted by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking
of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement or modification or release
(followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the
same assets), the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, any of (1) a solvency
opinion from an Independent Financial Advisor which confirms the solvency of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by a
substantially concurrent retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (2)
a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person
which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such security interest after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or release (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets) or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any
qualifications customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel) confirming that, after giving effect
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or release (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a lien of at least

227


-----

equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document,
so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or released and replaced are
valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening
period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately
prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release
and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Issuer, Bidco and their respective Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the
requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary
protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions
from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Actions with respect to the Bidco Proceeds Loan_**

The Indenture will provide that:

(1) the Issuer may not sell, assign or otherwise transfer or forgive or waive any principal amount
of the Bidco Proceeds Loan (other than to secure the Notes, any Note Guarantees or the
Indenture, or to grant Permitted Collateral Liens, in each case as permitted under the Indenture
or in connection with a transaction permitted by “—Merger and Consolidation”);

(2) the Issuer may not amend the Bidco Proceeds Loan in a manner adverse in any material
respect to the Holders of the Notes (as determined in good faith by the Issuer), other than any
amendment to the interest terms including the interest rate payable thereunder; and

(3) any principal repayments received by the Issuer in respect of the Bidco Proceeds Loan prior to
its maturity shall be applied promptly to redeem the Notes; provided that the Issuer shall be
entitled to convert the Bidco Proceeds Loan into equity of Bidco and that the Bidco Proceeds
Loan may be prepaid or reduced, in each case, to facilitate or otherwise accommodate or reflect
a prior or substantially contemporaneous repayment, redemption or repurchase of outstanding
Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bidco Proceeds Loan may be cancelled forgiven or otherwise
repaid, released or discharged upon:

- a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of
Bidco (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the Indenture and Bidco ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as a
result of the sale or other disposition;

- the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all
the assets of Bidco (other than to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the Indenture;

- legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided
in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

- the conversion of the Bidco Proceeds Loan into Capital Stock of Bidco;

- as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and Consolidation” other than a
transaction where Bidco would merge into, be combined with or transfer all or substantially all
of its assets to a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary of the Issuer; or

- to the extent of such repayments, one or more repayments of principal of the Bidco Proceeds
Loan, up to an aggregate of 20% of the original principal amount of the Bidco Proceeds Loan,

228


-----

made upon the Issuer’s reasonable determination that such repayments are required or
expedient to optimize the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s tax position or liabilities
(including, without limitation, to mitigate any potential restrictions under French law on the
deductibility of interest accruing on Indebtedness or other obligations).

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested by the
Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of the Bidco Proceeds Loan in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of
the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent without the
consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee or
the Security Agent.

#### Events of Default

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued
under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply with the provisions of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation”;_

(4) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written
notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced by any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date,
which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of any grace period provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €30.0 million or
more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, Bidco or a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary
of the Issuer (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of

229


-----

€30.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged
liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the
judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral shall, at any time, cease
to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security
Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee or
Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of €5.0 million for
any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release
or amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or such Security Document or
any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid
or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default provisions”);

(9) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary or a group of Guarantors that when taken together
(as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary, ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such
Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor
denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any such Default continues
for 10 days (the “guarantee provisions”); and

(10) (a) failure by the Issuer to consummate a Special Mandatory Redemption on the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date as described above under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption” or (b) the Lien purported to be granted over the Notes Escrow Account_
in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the Escrow Charge
being held in any non-appealable judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid.

However, a default under clauses (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of this paragraph will not constitute an
Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (4), (5), (7), (8) or
(9) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4), (5), (7), (8) or
(9) as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) or (10)(a) above)
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the
Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all
the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued
and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately.
In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described
in clause (5) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes
shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event
of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall have been remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of
the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the
Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or
waived.

230


-----

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) or (10)(a) above occurs and is continuing, the
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if
any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration
or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the
Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any
such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict
with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding)
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way
of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of such security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not
given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred
on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, has occurred and is continuing, the
Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent
person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) reasonably satisfactory to it
against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of
the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the
Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a
Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee
may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to
deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous
year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence of a
Default or an Event of Default, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would

231


-----

constitute a Default or an Event of Default, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a
failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”)
then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a
required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further
action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be
cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of
pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in
relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take
action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take
action directly.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the
Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

#### Amendments and Waivers

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified and amendments to the Bidco Proceeds Loan, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Charge or the Shortfall Agreement that would be adverse to the Holders of Notes in material
respects may be approved with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions,
any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such
Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of
clause (8), 80%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes affected, an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at
which any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
_Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, and interest on, such
Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any
such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
a payment required by the provisions described above under “Change of Control” or “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”);_

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes”
that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the

232


-----

terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) release (i) all or substantially all of the Collateral granted for the benefit of the Holders or
(ii) any Note Guarantee, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security
Documents and the Indenture or except as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note
Document, the Escrow Charge, the Shortfall Agreement and the Bidco Proceeds Loan to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under any of the documents referenced above;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that
the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the legal rights of any Holder in any material
respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance
of Additional Notes;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add Collateral for the_
benefit of the Notes, to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a
Guarantee with respect to the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination,
discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security
Documents) with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Note Documents of a
successor Trustee and/or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for
the accession by the Trustee and/or Security Agent to any Note Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Senior Facilities
Agreement, in any property which is required by the Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on
the Completion Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest
is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security
interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not
prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—No
_Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;_

233


-----

(10) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the
issuance and administration of the Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the
Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the
Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

(11) to release the security interests created by the Security Documents or any Guarantees as
provided by the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(12) to amend, supplement or otherwise modify the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the
Shortfall Agreement or the Proceeds Loans in ways that would not be adverse to the Holders of
Notes in any material respect.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such evidence
as it deems appropriate including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form
of any proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will
not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to effect an amendment authorized by clause (4) above
in respect of providing for a Guarantee for the benefit of Holders, the supplemental indenture
providing for the accession of such Guarantor shall be duly authorized and executed by the
Issuer, such additional Guarantor and the Trustee (and no other party).

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants,” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of holders of the
Notes to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

#### Acts by Holders

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes
have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer or by any
Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common
control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

#### Defeasance

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and any Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and
the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights,
powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the
Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations
of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency
for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer
exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such time will terminate
(other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and
“—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “—
_Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross_

234


-----

acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and its Significant
Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provisions and the security default
provisions described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its
prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance
option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the
Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in
clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5), (6) (other than with respect_
to the Issuer), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the
Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations
or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the
Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit
and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance
had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United
States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for
or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not
constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment
Company Act of 1940; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee
may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

#### Satisfaction and Discharge

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security Documents will
be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or
transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all
outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other
than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their
Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in
the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for

235


-----

this purpose), euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge without consideration of reinvestment the
entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have
become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;
(3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the
Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money towards payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the
case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture_
have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as
to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)).

#### No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Note
Documents, the Shortfall Agreement, the Escrow Charge or for any claim based on, in respect of,
or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws
and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

#### Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, of which a responsible
officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are
set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee
will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same
degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive
rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will
not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates
and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or
acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee
or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of
the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability
and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

#### Notices

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses
in the register of the Holders of the Notes, if any, maintained by the Registrar. Alternatively, all

236


-----

notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if disseminated through the newswire service of
Bloomberg (or if Bloomberg does not operate, any similar agency) or published in a leading
English language daily newspaper published in London or, if such publication is not reasonably
practicable, in such other English language daily newspaper with general circulation in Europe as
the Trustee may approve. It is expected that any such publication will normally be made in the
_Financial Times._

In addition, for so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if
and to the extent the rules of the Exchange shall so require, notices with respect to the Notes will
be posted on the official website of the Exchange. In addition, for so long as any Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered to Euroclear
and Clearstream, each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests. Such
notices may also be published on the website of the Exchange, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by the rules of the Exchange.

Each such notice, including without limitation through the newswire service of Bloomberg (or if
Bloomberg does not operate, any similar agency) shall be deemed to have been given on the
date of such publication or, if published more than once on different dates, on the first date on
which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to
have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any
notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time
prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not
affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is
given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

#### Prescription

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on
the Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims
against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed
five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

#### Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the relevant Note Guarantees, if
any, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency
other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of
any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge of the obligations of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as
applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the
amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery
(or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss
sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors
will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making
any such purchase.

For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the
matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably

237


-----

satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in
making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation
from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a
Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in
full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under any Note, any Note Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with
any euro-denominated restriction herein, the euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

#### Enforceability of Judgments

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are held outside the United States, and any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to
the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, may
not be collectable within the United States.

#### Consent to Jurisdiction and Service

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture
and the Notes and the Note Guarantees, the Issuer and any Guarantor will in the Indenture
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

#### Governing Law

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the
parties thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements will be
governed by English law.

#### Certain Definitions

“Acquired Indebtedness” means Indebtedness (1) of a Person or any of its Subsidiaries existing at

rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer on the Calculation Date will be deemed
to have been a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer at all times during the four fiscal quarter
reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer on the Calculation Date will be
deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer at any time during the four fiscal
quarter reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and such Indebtedness is to be given pro
_forma effect, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect_
on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire four fiscal quarter reference
period (taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness if such
Hedging Obligation has a remaining term as at the Calculation Date in excess of 12 months, or, if
shorter, at least equal to the remaining term of such Indebtedness); and

(7) interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting Officer of the Issuer to be the

on the first day of the four fiscal quarter reference period; provided that, if definitive
documentation has been entered into with respect to any Purchase that is part of the transaction
causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be

# Book-Entry; Delivery and Form

#### General

The Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities
Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons
attached (a “Rule 144A Global Note”). The Notes sold outside the United States in compliance
with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in
registered form without interest coupons attached (a “Regulation S Global Note” and, together
with the Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the
Issue Date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”
and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited
to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests
through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on
the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described
below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations
may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the
Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or
“holders” of the Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or its nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global
Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer
their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture, respectively.

None of the Issuer, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Trustee will have
any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

#### Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive
registered Notes in certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) only:

(1) if either Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue
to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement
action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuer will instruct the Registrar to issue Definitive Registered Notes,
registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on
behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable (in accordance with their respective

277


-----

customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the
beneficial ownership of Book Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the
Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and
the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership
of the relevant Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the
registered office of the Issuer and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and
operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

#### Redemption of the Global Notes

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such
Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global
Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand
that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are
to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants’ accounts on
a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as
they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no BookEntry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

#### Payments on Global Notes

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the common depositary or
its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary will distribute such payments
to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of
all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future
taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be
required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any
such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we will pay additional amounts as may be
necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of
Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such
holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry
Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to
owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent and
their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the common
depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominee)) as the owners thereof for the purpose
of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee,
the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will
have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments

278


-----

made by Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

#### Currency of Payment for the Global Notes

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of,
the Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear or
Clearstream in euro.

#### Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only
at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking
of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under
the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserve the
right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

#### Transfers

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder
of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell
Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such
securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with
the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” BookEntry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if
available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification

279


-----

(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance
with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if
required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease
to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest
in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as
long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

#### Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. We have provided the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the
settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream
hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in
accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest
to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or
Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the
lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain
persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

280


-----

#### Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s
rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures,
and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any
Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying
Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

#### Initial Settlement

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

#### Secondary Market Trading

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will
settle in same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

#### Trustee’s Powers

In considering the interests of the holders of Notes, while title to the Notes is registered in the
name of a nominee of a clearing system, the Trustee may rely without further investigation on
any information provided to it by that clearing system as to the identity (either individually or by
category) of its accountholders with entitlements to Notes and may consider such interests as if
such accountholders were the holders of the Notes.

#### Enforcement

For the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of the Indenture against the Trustee, the
persons named in a certificate of the holder of the Notes in respect of which a Global Note is
issued shall be recognized as the beneficiaries of the trusts set out in the Indenture to the extent
of the principal amounts of their interests in the Notes set out in the certificate of the holder, as
if they were themselves the holders of Notes in such principal amounts.

# Transfer Restrictions

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other_
_transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes offered
hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A)
in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes or the Guarantees under the U.S.
Securities Act and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Notes to the
Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

- in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as
defined in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them
in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, and that the
Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S.
Securities Act or any state securities law, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so
registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws,
pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer
and it is either:

(a) QIB and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A,
and the acquisition of the Notes will be for its own account or for the account of another
QIB; or

(b) it is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of them,
have made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of any Notes other than
the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has
been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to
the Notes. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us, the Issuer and
its subsidiaries and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to

282


-----

purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information
from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor
any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the
accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum. It acknowledges that we, and not the
Initial Purchasers, have ultimate authority over the statements contained in this Offering
Memorandum, including the content of those statements and whether and how to communicate
them.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or
for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act
or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property
or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and
subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other
exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) Each holder of Notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”) agrees on its own
behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing Notes, and each
subsequent holder of the Rule 144A Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to
offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination
Date”) that is one year after the later of the Issue Date and the last date on which the Issuer or
any of its affiliates was the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) only (i) to the
Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has
been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for
resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its
own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made
in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in
compliance with Regulation S, or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any
requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account
or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state
securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s
and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (v) to require
that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed
and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply
subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date. Each purchaser acknowledges that each
Rule 144A Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR
PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED,
ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR
UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT.

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, AGREES TO OFFER, SELL OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE DATE (THE “RESALE RESTRICTION
TERMINATION DATE”) THAT IS ONE YEAR AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE
HEREOF AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS
THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF THIS SECURITY) ONLY (A) TO THE
ISSUER, THE GUARANTORS OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) PURSUANT TO A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT

TO RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”), TO A PERSON IT
REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A
THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN
RELIANCE ON RULE 144A, (D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE
UNITED STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, OR
(E) PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES
TO ANY REQUIREMENT OF LAW THAT THE DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY
OF SUCH INVESTOR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR
CONTROL AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND ANY
APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND
THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER PURSUANT TO
CLAUSE (E) TO REQUIRE THAT A CERTIFICATE OF TRANSFER IN THE FORM APPEARING ON
THE REVERSE OF THIS NOTE IS COMPLETED AND DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR TO THE
TRUSTEE; AND AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS
TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND.

If it purchases Notes, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(6) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers Notes notice of any restrictions
on transfer of such Notes. It acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for
registration or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence
satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been
complied with.

(7) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements,
representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements,
representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of Notes
is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as
a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment
discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor
account.

(8) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States)
by the Issuer, any of the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering
of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any
other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is
required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set
forth under “Plan of Distribution.”

(9) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or
sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the
Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale
is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from
registration under the U.S. Securities Act.

# Tax Considerations

#### The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (“FTT”)

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s
Proposal”) for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France,
Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the participating Member States). Estonia has since
stated that it would no longer participate.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings
in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market
transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both
within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain
dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution established in a
Participating Member State, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State.
A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member
State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in
a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the
dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It
may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear.
Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are
advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

#### Certain French Tax Consequences

The following is a summary of certain French withholding tax considerations. This summary is based
on provisions of French tax laws and regulations, as in force and applied by the French tax authorities
at the date of this Offering Memorandum. This summary does not purport to be a complete analysis
of all tax considerations relating to the Notes. It is included herein solely for information purposes
and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice.

This summary is only addressed to holders of Notes who are not shareholders of the Issuer.

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes will
not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Code général
_des impôts (“FTC”) unless such payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or_
territory (Etat ou territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC (a
“Non-Cooperative State”). If such payments are made in a Non-Cooperative State, a 75%
withholding tax is applicable to such payments (subject to certain exceptions and to the
provisions of an applicable double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the FTC. The list of
Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is updated
each year.

Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the FTC, interest and assimilated revenues with
respect to the Notes will not be deductible from the Issuer’s taxable result if they are paid or
accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account
held in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State (the “Deductibility
Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and assimilated revenues
may be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the FTC, in
which case they may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC,
at a rate of 30% or 75% (subject to the provisions of an applicable double tax treaty).

285


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III
of the FTC nor, to, the Deductibility Exclusion and the related withholding tax set out under
Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC that may be levied as a result of such Deductibility Exclusion will apply
in respect of the Notes if the Issuer can prove that (i) the main purpose and effect of the issue of
the Notes was not that of locating the interest in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”) and
(ii) in respect of the Deductibility Exclusion that the relevant interest and assimilated revenues
relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount. Pursuant to
the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts (BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20140211 § 550 and 990,
BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-10-20-40-20140211 § 70 and 80 and BOI-IR-DOMIC-10-20-20-60-20150320
§ 10), the Notes will benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any
evidence supporting the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes, if the Notes are:

- offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Code
_monétaire et financier (French Monetary and Financial Code) or pursuant to an equivalent_
offer in a state other than a Non-Cooperative State (for this purpose, an “equivalent offering”
means any offering requiring the registration or submission of an offering document by or
with a foreign securities market authority);

- admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or on a multilateral financial
instruments trading facility provided that such market or facility is not located in an
Non-Cooperative State and that such market is operated by a market operator, an investment
services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity that is not located in a
Non-Cooperative State; or

- admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities
clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of
the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or
operators provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

The Notes issued by the Issuer under this Offering Memorandum qualify as debt securities under
French commercial law. Considering that the Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to
the operations of Euroclear and Clearstream, i.e. to the operations of a central depositary or of a
securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.
561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code which is not located in a Non-Cooperative
State, payments made by the Issuer in respect of the Notes to their holders will be exempt from
the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the FTC. Moreover, under the same
conditions and since the relevant interest and assimilated revenues should be considered as
relating to genuine transactions and not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and
assimilated revenues paid by the Issuer on the Notes should not be subject to the Deductibility
Exclusion and, as a result, should not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119
_bis 2 of the FTC solely on account of their being paid on an account held in a financial institution_
established in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in
a Non-Cooperative State.

Besides, pursuant to Article 125 A of the FTC, when the paying agent is established in France and
subject to certain exceptions, interest and similar income received by individuals fiscally domiciled
(domiciliés fiscalement) in France may be subject to a 24% withholding tax, which is deductible
from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been
made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are also levied by way of
withholding tax at an aggregate rate of 15.5% on such interest and similar income received by
individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France.

#### Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below), who
purchases the Notes in the Offering at the offer price indicated on the cover page, but does not
purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This summary is based upon the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued
thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date
hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from
the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the
matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position
concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition
of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be
relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to
special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions, U.S.
expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S.
Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, grantor trusts, tax-exempt
organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or
other pass through entities (or investors in such entities), persons liable for alternative minimum
tax and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or
other integrated transaction and persons who own, directly, indirectly, or constructively ten
percent (10%) or more of the Issuer’s stock. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who
hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This discussion
does not address any tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences and
does not address the Medicare tax on certain investment income. Further, this discussion does not
address any consequences that may result pursuant to Treasury regulations promulgated under
section 385 of the Code with respect to any holder that is considered related to the Issuer for the
purposes of such regulations.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
(ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organized under the laws of
the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of
which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court
within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the
trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the
tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such
partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes. The discussion below assumes that the Notes will be
treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the**
**tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including**
**the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well**
**as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws and state, local, foreign or**
**other tax laws.**

287


-----

**_Additional Amounts_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description
_of the Notes—Change of Control”), we may be obliged to pay amounts in excess of stated_
interest or principal on the Notes. Our obligation to pay such excess amounts may implicate the
provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” Under
these regulations, however, one or more contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be
treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if, as of the Issue Date, such contingencies in
the aggregate are considered “remote” or “incidental.” We believe and intend to take the
position that the foregoing contingencies should be treated as remote and/or incidental. Our
position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it
is taking a different position. However, this determination is inherently factual and we can give
you no assurance that our position would be sustained if challenged by the IRS. A successful
challenge of this position by the IRS could require a holder subject to U.S. federal income
taxation to accrue ordinary income at a rate that is higher than the stated interest rate and to
treat any gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income,
rather than capital gain. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be
considered contingent payment debt instruments. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult
their own tax advisers regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent
payment debt regulations and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Payments of interest on the Notes (including any non-U.S. tax withheld on such payments and
any Additional Amounts) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the
time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder of Notes that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize
interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on
the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A
cash basis U.S. Holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of
stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual
disposal of the foreign currency received.

A U.S. Holder of Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes, or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized
with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method,
such holder will recognize income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the
foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at
the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual
period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S.
holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may make an election (which
must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed
without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange
on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial
accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days
of the last day of the accrual period. Regardless of the method chosen, a U.S. Holder of Notes
that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain
or loss to the extent of the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined
at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest
income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated
as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be
treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the Notes are issued at an “issue price” (as defined above) which is less than the stated
principal amount the Notes will be considered to have been issued with original issue discount
(“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless the difference is less than a de minimis
threshold (equal to [1]⁄4 of 1% of the Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied by the number of
complete years to maturity from their “issue date”). The “issue date” is the first date upon which
a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for cash to persons other than bondhouses, brokers or
similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or
wholesalers.

A U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally will be required to include
OID with respect to the notes in gross income (as ordinary income) as the OID accrues (on a
constant yield to maturity basis), before the receipt of cash payments attributable to such OID. In
general, the amount of OID includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder will generally be
equal to a ratable amount of OID with respect to the Note for each day in an accrual period
during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year on which a U.S. Holder held the Note. An
accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term of
the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled
payment of principal or interest occurs either on the final day of an accrual period or on the first
day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period is an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of (i) the product of the Note’s adjusted issue price at the beginning of such
accrual period and its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of a compounding assumption
that reflects the length of the accrual period over (ii) the sum of the stated interest payments on
the notes allocable to the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the beginning of
any accrual period generally equals the issue price of the Note increased by the amount of all
previously accrued OID.

A U.S. Holder of Notes treated as issued with OID must (i) determine OID allocable to each
accrual period in euros using the constant yield method described above, and (ii) translate the
amount of OID into U.S. dollars and recognize foreign currency gain or loss in the same manner
as described above for stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. U.S. Holders should
note that because the cash payment in respect of accrued OID on a Note will not be made until
maturity or other disposal of the Note, a greater possibility exists for fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates (and the required recognition of exchange gain or loss) than is the case
for foreign currency instruments issued without OID. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax
advisors regarding the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign currency
exchange gain or loss rules.

The rules regarding OID are complex and the rules described above may not apply in all cases.
Accordingly, you should consult your own tax advisors regarding their application.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss above, interest income and accrued OID on a
Note generally will constitute foreign source income and be considered “passive category
income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income
tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at a rate applicable to such U.S.
Holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or, at such holder’s election, a deduction in lieu of
such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The
calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S.
Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
availability of foreign tax credits.

289


-----

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**
Generally, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the
amount realized on the disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest
not previously included in income, which will be taxable as such) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted
tax basis in the Note.

The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for
an amount of foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on
the spot rate on the date payment is received or the Note is disposed of. If the Note is traded on
an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it so elects, an accrual basis
taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of
the disposition. If an accrual basis taxpayer makes the election described in the preceding
sentence (and in the paragraph below), such election must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If a Note is
not traded on an established securities market (or, if a Note is so traded, but the applicable U.S.
holder is an accrual basis taxpayer that has not made the settlement date election), a U.S. Holder
will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) to the extent
that the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency received (based on the exchange rate on the
settlement date of the disposition) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of such Note to such U.S.
Holder, increased by the amount of previously accrued OID, if any. The cost of a Note purchased
with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the
date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on
an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it so elects, an accrual basis
taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note at the spot rate on the
settlement date of the purchase.

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss below, gain or loss recognized upon the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (i) generally will be U.S.
source gain or loss and (ii) generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain
or loss if at the time of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition
the Note has been held by such U.S. Holder for more than one year. Long term capital gain
realized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be subject to taxation at a reduced rate.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a
Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates relating to the principal thereof
will be ordinary income or loss and will be equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar
value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date
of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the
U.S. Holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S.
Holder acquired the Note (or, in each case, on the settlement date, if the Note is traded on an
established securities market and the holder is either a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing
accrual basis U.S. Holder). Foreign exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued and
unpaid interest, including OID, if any) on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S.
holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be
treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax
credit limitation purposes.

Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications
of the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes.

290


-----

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes as described under “Description of the Notes.” These
Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the
original Notes, in some cases may not be treated fungible with the original Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In such a case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have been issued
with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes even if the original Notes had
no original issue discount. These differences may affect the market value of the original Notes if
the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Under Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including,
in certain circumstances, the receipt of interest on a note, or a sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a
foreign currency note to the extent that any such receipt, sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an
investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction
Disclosure Statement).

**_Certain Information Reporting Requirements with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals are required to file IRS Form 8938 (Statement of
Specified Foreign Financial Assets as defined in section 6038D of the Code) to report information
relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for
Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). Under certain circumstances,
an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these requirements on their ownership
and disposition of the Notes. Penalties may apply for failure to properly complete and file IRS
Form 8938.

**_Backup Withholding and Related Information Reporting Requirements_**

In general, payments of interest (including the accrual of OID) and the proceeds from sales or
other dispositions (including retirements or redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. Holder may be
required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient and, when
required, demonstrates this fact. In addition, a U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient may be
subject to backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise
complies with applicable certification requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be
credited against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to
a refund, provided that the appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_FATCA_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru
payments” made after the later of December 31, 2018 or the date of publication of final Treasury
regulations defining the term “foreign passthru payment.” Current Treasury Regulations provide
that debt issued by a foreign financial institution on or prior to the date that is six months after
the date on which applicable final regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are filed
generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. No such
regulations have yet been issued. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial
institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant
modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United
States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to

291


-----

implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. Holders should consult
their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the
event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there
generally will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

#### Certain Other Tax Considerations; Payments by a Guarantor

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes it is possible that such
payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be
available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other
exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor will be eligible
for all the exemptions described above.

# Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations

_Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in each of the_
_jurisdictions in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are organized. This is a summary only, and_
_bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar proceedings, could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions_
_and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The application of_
_these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law_
_should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment_
_in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests on the Collateral._

#### European Union

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency
Regulation”), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to
a company is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the company
concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main
interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have
differing and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable
presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its
“centre of main interests” in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office,
Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” of a
debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its
interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect,
factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the
majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are
established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its
“centre of main interests.”

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it
has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU
Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in
Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one EU Member
State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States
(other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another EU Member
State. If the “centre of main interests” of a debtor is in one EU Member State (other than
Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member
State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” only in the event
that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other EU Member State. The
effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the
territory of such other EU Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any
other EU Member State, no court of any other EU Member State has jurisdiction to open
territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. In the
event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of Cerba HealthCare’s
subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the
outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

293


-----

Starting from June 26, 2017, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings will replace the EU Insolvency Regulation. The
content of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings is not further discussed in this offering memorandum.

#### France

**_Insolvency_**
We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the centre of main
interests, within the meaning of EU Insolvency Regulation or, if not applicable, the main center
of our interests within the meaning of article R.600-1 of the French Commercial Code, of any of
the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is deemed to be in France, it would be subject to French
proceedings affecting creditors, including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or
_conciliation proceedings) and court-administered proceedings being either safeguard_
proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
(sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization
proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).
In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights
under the Notes and/or the Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding
security interests in the Collateral.

Under the European Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, if a
debtor is located in the European Union (other than Denmark), French courts shall have
jurisdiction over the main insolvency proceedings if the debtor’s centre of main interests is
situated in France. In the case of a debtor or legal person, the place of the registered office shall
be presumed to be its centre of main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. In
determining whether the centre of main interests of a debtor is in France, French courts will take
into account a broad range of factual elements.

The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be
relevant to holders of the Notes.

A reform of the French Civil Code was introduced by Ordinance no. 2016-131 dated February 10,
2016 and has been effective since October 1, 2016. Absent any practical application yet, the
potential impacts of certain provisions of such reform (such as the doctrine of hardship
(imprévision)) on the rights of the parties to French-law contracts (including French law Security
Documents) entered into as from such date are being discussed among certain academics notably
within the context of insolvency proceedings. Reference to articles of the French Civil Code below
are those currently available (the article numbers prior to such reform are mentioned between
brackets for information only).

_Warning Procedure (procédure d’alerte)_
In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for
warning procedures. When there are elements which they believe put the company’s existence as
a going concern in jeopardy, the statutory auditors of a company must request the management
to provide an explanation. Failing satisfactory explanation or appropriate corrective measures,
the auditors must request that a board of directors (or the equivalent body), and as the case may
be at a later stage the shareholders’ meeting be convened. Depending on the answers provided
to them (and the type of company), the auditors must inform the President of the relevant
Commercial or Civil Court of the warning procedure.

Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee (or in
their absence the employees’ representatives) have similar rights.

The President of the relevant Commercial or Civil Court can also himself summon the
management to provide explanations on elements which the President of the relevant

294


-----

Commercial or Civil Court believes put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy (or
when the company has not filed its annual financial statements within the statutory timeframe,
despite his/her injunction).

_Grace Periods_
In addition to the specific provisions of insolvency law discussed below, you could, like any other
creditors, be subject to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil) (previously Article
1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil)).

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial
proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into
account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule
over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations and decide that
any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a
rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published
annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment
of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil)
(previously Article 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil)) will suspend any pending
enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not
accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. A creditor cannot
contract out of such grace periods.

With respect to grace periods under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil)
(previously Article 1244-1et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil)) of the French Civil Code,
pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced
conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement, impose
grace periods on creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax
and social security administrations) for their claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation
agreement.

**_Insolvency Test_**
Under French law, a company is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements)
when it is unable to pay its due debts with its available assets taking into account available credit
lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of
the court ruling commencing the insolvency proceedings, unless the Court sets an earlier date,
which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such opening ruling. Except for
fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court
decision that sanctioned an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation
proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (période
_suspecte) (see below)._

**_Court-Assisted Proceedings_**
A French debtor facing difficulties without being insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements)
(or for 45 calendar days or less in the case of conciliation proceedings) may request the
commencement of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which
is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders e.g. agreement to
reduce or reschedule its indebtedness. Mandat ad hoc and conciliation are proceedings carried
out under the supervision of the Court, which do not trigger any stay of enforcement against the
debtor.

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In_
practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties
but are not in a state of insolvency (cessation de paiements) (see “Insolvency Test” above). They
are informal, confidential and are not limited in time. They are carried out under the aegis of a

295


-----

court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc, whose name can be suggested by the debtor) itself
under the supervision of the Court and do not automatically involve any stay of the claims or
pending proceedings The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent
Court that appoints him or her. Mandataires ad hoc are usually appointed in order to facilitate
negotiations with creditors but cannot coerce the creditors into accepting any proposal. The
agreement reached between the debtor and its creditors (if any) with the help of the mandataire
_ad hoc will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing_
to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. Creditors are not barred from taking legal
action against the debtor to recover their claims but they usually accept not to do so. In any
event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period, as set forth
above. The agreement reached is reported to the Court but is not formally approved by it. The
ordinance of the Court appointing the Mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for information
purposes to the debtor’s auditors.

_Conciliation proceedings are available to a debtor that faces current or foreseeable difficulties of_
a legal, economic or financial nature and which (at the time the conciliation proceedings are
commenced) has not been in a state of insolvency (cessation de paiements) (see “Insolvency Test”
above) for more than 45 calendar days. The debtor petitions the President of the Commercial
Court for the appointment of a conciliator (whose name it can suggest) in charge of assisting the
debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners that
puts an end to its difficulties, providing e.g. for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Conciliation
proceedings are confidential and may last up to four months (an additional extension can be
requested by the conciliator provided that further to such extension the proceedings do not
exceed five months). During the proceedings, creditors may continue to individually claim
payment of their claims but they usually accept not to. In addition, the debtor retains the right to
petition the judge who opened the proceedings for grace periods pursuant to Article 1343-5 of
the French Civil Code (Code civil) as set forth above (previously Article 1244-1 et seq. of the
French Civil Code (Code civil)), in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the
conciliator.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be either acknowledged (constaté)
by the President of the Commercial Court or approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court. It
will become binding upon them only and the creditors party thereto may not take action against
the debtor in respect of claims governed by the conciliation agreement. The acknowledgement
(constatation) of the conciliation agreement by the President of the Commercial Court upon all
parties’ request, gives the agreement the legal force of a final judgment, which means that it
constitutes a judicial title that can be enforced by the parties without further recourse to a judge
(titre exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. So long as the
conciliation agreement is in effect, interest accruing on the affected claims can no longer be
compounded.

In case of acknowledgement (constat) or approval (homologation), the Court can, at the request
of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement
(mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution.

The approval (homologation) by the Court, upon the debtor’s request will make the existence of
the conciliation proceedings public and have the following specific consequences:

- creditors who provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of
the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a
capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-proceedings and post-proceedings
claims (except with respect to certain pre-petition employment claims and procedural costs)
(the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial
reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation; and

- in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of the cessation des paiements, and therefore the starting date of the

296


-----

hardening period (as defined below—see The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial
reorganization and liquidation proceedings), cannot be set by the Court as of a date earlier
than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the Court (see above
regarding the definition of the date of the cessation des paiements) except in case of fraud.

The court decision approving the conciliation agreement does not make its terms public (save for
the information of the works council or the employees representatives, if any, on the content of
the agreement) but makes public the guarantees and the terms of the New Money Lien granted
to the creditors under the conciliation agreement.

While the agreement (whether acknowledged or approved) is in force the debtor retains the
right to petition the Court that opened conciliation proceedings for a debt rescheduling,
pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil) as set forth above (previously
article 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code(Code civil)), in relation to claims of creditors (other
than public creditors) party to the conciliation, in which case the decision would be taken after
having heard the conciliator in the event that he has been appointed to monitor the
implementation of the agreement.

A third party having granted a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or a security interest (sûreté réelle)
with respect to the debtor’s obligations can benefit from the provisions of the approved or
acknowledged conciliation agreement.

In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to it can petition the President
of the Commercial Court for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted
in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided that the
conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to
the claims included in the agreement are suspended. The commencement of subsequent
insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which
case the creditors will recover their claims, decreased by the payments already received, and their
security interests.

Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is
supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to meet the threshold requirements for
creditors’ consent in safeguard, will be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated
safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

In the event of the commencement of subsequent safeguard or judicial reorganization
proceedings, within the context of the adoption of a safeguard plan or a recovery plan, the Court
will not be able to impose a payment deferral to a date later than the date on which the plan is
adopted, or debt reductions, to creditors with respect to their claims benefiting from the New
Money Lien.

At the request of the debtor and after the participating creditors have been consulted on the
matter, the conciliator may be appointed with a mission to organize the partial or total sale of
the debtor which would be implemented, as applicable, in the context of subsequent safeguard,
judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings; any offers received in this context by the
conciliator may be directly submitted to the Court in the context of reorganization or liquidation
proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor.

Any contractual provision that modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing
contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the
designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a
request submitted to this end, and any contractual provision requiring the debtor to bear, by
reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation
proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by
creditors in connection with these proceedings, are deemed null and void.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**
A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion,
initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it
is not insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements). Creditors of the debtor do not attend the
hearing before the Court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested.
Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator is
usually appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period (the
period from the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the date on which
the Court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months,
and to help the debtor elaborate a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it
will propose to its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which
remain in the hands of the debtor, assisted by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur
_judiciaire) who will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment, exercise ex post facto control_
over decisions made by the debtor (“mission de surveillance”) or assist the debtor to make all or
some of the management decisions (“mission d’assistance”), all under the supervision of the
Court.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the
commencement of the proceedings is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example,
the Court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed
for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as
collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). In addition, creditors are required to
declare to the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) the debts that
arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings (as well as the post-commencement
non-privileged debts) and are prohibited from engaging any court proceedings against the
debtor for any payment default in relation to such debts, and the accrual of interest on loans
with a term of less than one year (or on payments deferred for less than one year) is stopped.
Debts duly arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to
expenses necessary for the debtor’s business activities during the observation period (see above),
are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for services rendered or
goods delivered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if
not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard
proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New Money Lien).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under
the plan (debt forgiveness and payment terms) prior to the plan being approved by the Court.

The rules governing consultation vary according to the size of the business.

_Standard consultation:_ for debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or
prepared by a chartered accountant, and who have less than 150 employees or €20 million of
turnover, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the
court-appointed creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed
a claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment times proposed. Creditors are consulted
individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the proposals for settlement can vary according to the
creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at the
consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, in the absence of a
specific legislative prohibition, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that
it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed
creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a
proposal for a partial payment of the claim over a shorter time period instead of a full payment
of the claim over ten years.

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as
soon as the plan is approved do not need to be consulted.

298


-----

Creditors consulted in writing which do not respond within 30 days are deemed to have accepted
the proposal. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is
notified to the debtor, the administrator and the controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were
submitted to them, the Court that approves the reorganization plan (plan de redressement) can
impose on them a uniform rescheduling of their claims (subject to the specific regime of claims
benefiting from the New Money Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for claims
with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the Court, in which case the maturity
date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed
without its creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the
judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual
installment must be of at least 5% of the total amount of the debt claim) or the year following
the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the date of the first anniversary of the adoption
of the plan, in which case the amount of the payment is determined in accordance with the
specific rules in order to ensure that the full amount of the claim is repaid within the 10 year
period.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the
judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual
installment must be of at least 5% of the total amount of the debt claim) or the year following
the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the date of the first anniversary of the adoption
of the plan, in which case the amount of the payment is determined in accordance with the
specific rules in order to ensure that the full amount of the claim is repaid within the 10 year
period.

_Committee-based consultation:_ In the case of large companies (whose accounts are certified by
a statutory auditor or established by a chartered-accountant and with more than 150 employees
or a turnover greater than €20 million), or with the consent of the Court in the case of debtors
that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds, two creditors’ committees have to be
established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to
the initial judgment:

- one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or
advances in favor of the debtor; and

- the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount
of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such
committee by the court-appointed administrator.

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes), a
general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established irrespective of whether
or not there are different issuances and of the governing law of those obligations (the
“Bondholders’ General Meeting”). The Notes constitute obligations for the purposes of
safeguard proceedings.

It is unclear whether the Security Agent as creditor of the Parallel Debt under the Intercreditor
Agreement would vote in the creditor’s committee.

The proposed plan:

- must take into account subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings;

- may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

299


-----

- may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of
claims benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity
swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share
capital increase by way of a set-off with their claims against the debtor, as reduced as the case
may be according to the provisions of the plan.

Creditors which are members of the credit institutions’ committee or the suppliers’ committee
may also prepare an alternative safeguard or reorganization plan that will also be put to the
vote of the committees and of the general bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval
of these alternative plans is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and
in the Bondholders General Meeting and gives rise to a report by the judicial administrator.
Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within a minimum of 15 days of its
submission. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee, provided that the
majority is two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote.

Each creditor member of a creditors committee and each holder of the Notes must, if applicable,
inform the judicial administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to the exercise of its
vote, to the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination
agreement. The judicial administrator shall then submit to the creditor/holder of the Notes a
proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/Bondholders General
Meeting. In the event of a disagreement, the creditor/holder of the Notes or the judicial
administrator may request that the matter be decided by the President of the Commercial Court
in summary proceedings. The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the
debtor do not give rise to voting rights.

In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the
plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as
soon as their claims are admitted, do not take part in the vote. Such creditors do not need to be
consulted on the plan.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted
for approval to the Bondholders’ General Meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote.
Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the Bondholders’ General Meeting and
determination of a rescheduling of the claim of creditors that are not members of the
committees or bondholders as discussed hereafter, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the
Court. In considering such approval, the Court has to verify that the interests of all creditors are
sufficiently protected and that relevant shareholder consent, if any is required, has been
obtained. Once approved by the Court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of
the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the
adoption of the plan).

Creditors outside the creditors’ committees or the Bondholders’ General Meeting are consulted in
accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above.

In the event that the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the
Bondholders’ General Meeting within the first six months of the observation period, either
because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it, this six month period may be
extended by the Court at the request of the judicial administrator, to the extent it does not
exceed the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved by the
committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the Court can still adopt a
safeguard plan in the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the
rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the Court empowers the administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting in order to take
corporate resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s share capital required by a

300


-----

safeguard plan, the Court may order that, under certain conditions, the shareholders’ decisions
be adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending or represented, as long as such
shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting rights.

If no plan is adopted by the committees, at the request of the debtor, the judicial administrator,
the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, the Court may convert the safeguard
proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a
safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to
the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions:_ Public creditors (financial administrations,
social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions
under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market
conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also
decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security
interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions, within the framework of a local
administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may
grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from
default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

In the event that safeguard (or judicial reorganization) proceedings are commenced against any
of the Issuer, the holders of the Notes will not be members of the credit institutions’ committee
but would vote on any proposed draft safeguard plan as members of the Bondholders’ General
Meeting.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard_**
A debtor in conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have
been designed to “fast-track” difficulties of large companies:

- who publish consolidated accounts in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French
Commercial Code; or

- who publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public
accountant and have (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million
excluding VAT or (iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is
broadly the regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings to the extent compatible with
the accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard and/or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings, since the total duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months,
while the duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is one month, unless the
Court decides to extend it by an additional month.

In particular, the creditors committees and the Bondholders General Meeting are required to
vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of fifteen days of its being sent
to the creditors in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings or within 8 days thereof in
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The plan adopted in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard
proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt
into equity capital in the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent).

The accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors
that belong to the credit institutions committee and bondholders), the payment of whose debt is

301


-----

suspended until adoption of a plan through the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. As
to financial creditors, the debtor will be prohibited from paying any amounts (including
interests) in connection with the finance documents that fall due during the observation period.
Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the Court approving the safeguard plan
and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors,
the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary
course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings, the debtor must fulfill three conditions:

- the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings;

- as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not
in a position to overcome; and

- the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of his
business as a going concern supported by enough of its creditors subject to the proceedings
members of, as applicable, its credit institutions or major suppliers committee or its
Bondholders’ General Meeting, to render likely its adoption by a two-thirds majority of the
relevant Committee and General Meeting within a maximum of three months following the
commencement of of accelerated safeguard proceedings and of one month following the
commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (that can be extended by an
additional month).

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the Court within the deadlines
applicable to each, the Court shall terminate the proceedings. The Court cannot reschedule
amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceeding shall be drawn up by the
debtor and certified by the statutory auditor and shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such
claims for the purpose of the accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a
filing (see below).

**_Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**
Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation
_judiciaire) may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, with respect to_
liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is
required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation
proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent. De jure managers
(including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to civil liability if it
fails to do so.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the
Court considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, after having
heard the debtor, the Court may order the commencement of the proceedings which it finds
most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial
liquidation proceedings and the Court considers that judicial reorganization proceedings would
be more appropriate.

In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of
the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public
prosecutor or (at its own initiative) the Court may convert safeguard proceedings into
reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings. In all cases, the Court’s decision is only

302


-----

taken after having heard the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors’ representative, the
public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

Under the judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator appointed by the Court will
assist the debtor to make management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by
the Court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). As
a result of the commencement of liquidation proceedings, the managers of the debtor are no
longer in charge of the management.

In the event of reorganization, an administrator is usually appointed by the Court
(administrateur judiciaire) to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period,
which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor
(by helping the debtor to elaborate a reorganization plan, which is similar to a safeguard plan),
or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor.

Committees of creditors and a Bondholders General Meeting may be created under the same
conditions as in safeguard proceedings (see above). At any time during this observation period,
the Court can order the liquidation of the debtor. At the end of the observation period, the
outcome of the proceedings is decided by the Court.

If the Court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the Court will appoint a
liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). No
maximum time period is provided by law to limit the duration of the judicial liquidation process.
The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation
operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from
the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment).

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes of such
liquidation scenario:

- an asset sale plan (in which case the Court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to
manage the debtor and organize such sale of the business); or

- a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

 - launch auction sales;

 - sell on an amicable basis each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been
received, (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the
sale agreement with the bidder); or

 - request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, from all potential interested
purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process
whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices
being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés).

When either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors
(extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to
insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif), the Court terminates the proceedings.

In reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the
shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by
article L.626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee
(mandataire en justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the
shareholders which refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan
provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to
comply with the recovery plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will
recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the Court upon the request of the
administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business.

303


-----

The Court may terminate the proceedings when the interest of the continuation of the
liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets. The Court
may also appoint a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the
amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

**_The Hardening Period (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_**
The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing proceedings, unless the Court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than
18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the date of
insolvency may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved
an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The date of
insolvency is important because it marks the beginning of the “période suspecte” (otherwise
referred to as “hardening period”), being the period between the date of insolvency and the
Court decision commencing the proceedings. Certain transactions entered into during the
hardening period are void as of right or voidable by the Court. Automatically void transactions
include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute
voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These
include transfers of assets for no or nominal consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal
obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not
due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner which is not commonly used in the
ordinary course of business and security granted for debts (including a security granted to secure
a guarantee obligation) previously incurred and provisional measures (unless the attachment or
seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any
assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for debt
incurred simultaneously), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or
rights already transferred in the trust as a guarantee of debt incurred prior to such amendment,
and a declaration of non-seizability (déclaration d’insaisissabilité).

Transactions voidable by the Court include payments made on accrued debts, transactions for
consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures
(saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the Court
determines that the creditor knew of the insolvency of the debtor. Transactions relating to the
transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month
period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the safeguard or insolvency
proceedings constitutes an event of default are not enforceable against the debtor. Neither, in
accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n°12-22.909, are
“contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract,
diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of
reorganization proceedings” (case law which is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated
safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed officer
can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the
debtor will not be able to continue to perform.

Conversely, the court-appointed officer can, require that other parties to a contract continue to
perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the
condition that the debtor fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and provided
that, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the
debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however,
automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the Court orders the
continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the
business” (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once), in
which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision
adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the date on which the continued
operation of the business ends.

304


-----

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

- accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of
contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year, with respect to which,
however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded;

- the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related
(connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge appointed by the Court to
recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business);

- the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after commencement of the
proceedings unless they are incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation
period or in consideration of services rendered/ goods provided to the debtor;

- creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the
debtor where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior to the
court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is:

 - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however,
the creditor may require that a Court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of
claim, as described below);

 - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

 - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except where such asset,
whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, is located in another Member State
within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not
be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 EU
Insolvency Regulation; or

- immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrats en
_cours), absent consent to other terms of payment, will be required only in the context of_
reorganization or liquidation proceedings.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only
apply to the creditors that are subject to the accelerated safeguard proceedings or the
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings respectively (see above).

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of
proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two
months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des
_annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled_
outside France. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a
claim and no proof of claim has been filed yet, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to
be a filing on the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the debtor. Creditors are
allowed to ratify a proof of claim made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the
admissibility of the claim. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant
period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors’ representative are, except with
respect to limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the
proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors under
French law.

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however:

- debts owed to creditors other than banks, financial institutions or bondholders should be paid
in the ordinary course; and

305


-----

- the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the conciliation
proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors (failing which, its accountant).
Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also
avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as
set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit).
Those financial creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (but who would
belong to the financial institutions’ committee or the Bondholders’ General Meeting) would
have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the Court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard
plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the
terms of the plan. The Court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems to
be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

If the Court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated
towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the Court
decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the Court will appoint a liquidator (usually
the former creditor’s representative) in charge of managing the debtor, selling the assets of the
debtor and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice,
where the sale of the business is considered, the Court will usually appoint a judicial
administrator to manage the debtor during the temporary continuation of the business
operations (see above) and organize the sale of the business process.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including
employees, post-petition legal costs (essentially, fees of the officials appointed by the Court),
creditors who, as part of the approved conciliation agreement, have provided new money or
goods or services, post-petition creditors, certain pre-petition secured creditors in the event of
liquidation proceedings and the French State (taxes and social charges).

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, the immediate payment of any unpaid
amount of share capital of the debtor will be required.

The mandataire judiciaire may demand that a shareholder pay-up its portion of the unpaid share
capital.

_Void and Voidable Transaction_
“Void transactions” include transactions or payments entered into during the suspect period that
may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other
creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the
reciprocal obligations of the company significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of
debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner that is not commonly used in
the ordinary course of business, any escrow ordered by a judicial decision if such decision is not
final when reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced, security granted for debts
previously incurred, any provisional measures (unless the writ of attachment or seizure predates
the date of insolvency) operations relating to stock options, fiduciary transfers (unless the
transfer is made as a security for an indebtedness entered into simultaneously) and modifications
to existing fiduciary transfers securing previous debts.

“Voidable transactions” include payments for due debts made from the date of insolvency,
transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers
_détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the suspect period if the_
party dealing with the debtor company knew that it was insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test”).
Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when
entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the suspect period.

306


-----

_Creditors’ Liability_
Pursuant to article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case law, where
safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced,
creditors may be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor
only if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and, in the case of (i) fraud; (ii) interference
with the management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the
facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to
support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be
cancelled or reduced by the court.

_Limitations on Guarantees_
The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

- certain exceptions, including to the extent any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute
prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French
Commercial Code or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning of
Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code, it being specified that,
under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its
acquisition; and

- a contractual financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the
Offering of the Notes which the Issuer has applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each
French Guarantor and/or the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor through the
intercompany loans and cash pooling arrangements that are outstanding on the date a
payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee or security
and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that
the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court
found that the guarantor or security provider did not derive an overall corporate benefit from
the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. The existence of a
real and adequate corporate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are
commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides
no clear guidance.

French case law has recognized that certain intragroup transactions (including upstream
guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the relevant company, in particular, where the
following criteria are fulfilled:

- the existence of a genuine group of companies (taken as a whole, not just its shareholders)
operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective;

- the existence of a common economic, social or financial interests of the group within the
framework of a policy implemented by the group of companies;

- the transaction shall not be without due consideration and compensation and shall not change
the existing balance between the respective obligations of the relevant companies;

- the risk assumed by a French Guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;

- the French Guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage
from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee; and

- the obligations of the French Guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial
capability.

Accordingly, the Guarantees by the French Guarantors are limited to amounts recoverable
thereunder that represent either (i) the amount of debt made available directly or indirectly to

307


-----

that French Guarantor or its subsidiaries with the proceeds of Indebtedness previously incurred
by a holding company of such French Guarantor to the extent that such Indebtedness is or has
been refinanced directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Indebtedness of the Issuer constituting
Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which term includes the Notes
offered hereby (See “Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees”); and (ii) the amounts of
the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such French Guarantor, and the controlled
subsidiaries of that French Guarantor, through the intercompany loans, via the Group’s
cash-pooling arrangements or otherwise, and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to
be made by such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee. Any payment made by such
French Guarantor under its guarantee or under the intercompany loans or the cash pooling
arrangements will reduce the maximum amount of its guarantee. By virtue of this limitation, a
French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation
under its Notes Guarantee. See “Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees.”

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic
return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction
entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and
that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

_Limitation on Enforcement of Security Interests_
Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be
enforced following a payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured
amount that is due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, generally speaking, pledges over assets may be enforced at the option of the
secured creditors either (i) before a court (a) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public
auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (b) by way of the judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets; or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure
(attribution conventionnelle or pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors,
following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets.
Enforcement by way of contractual foreclosure may not be agreed at the time of the granting of
the security or subsequently and, therefore, the holders of the Notes will not benefit from such
enforcement method.

If the secured creditors choose enforcement by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure
or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of
the attributed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by an expert (pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a
judged) in the context of a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire). In case of enforcement
by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), if the value of the
pledged assets exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be
required to pay the relevant pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between the value of the
pledged assets and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual
amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the
Collateral. On the contrary, if the value of such pledged assets is less than the amount of the
secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount
equal to the value of such pledged assets, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will
be unsecured.

Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the
securities, an enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public
auction in accordance with applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed
for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in
any such auction might not reflect the value of our group as a going concern.

308


-----

_Parallel Debt_
Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee
and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the
creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as trustees
(fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés)
under Article 2328-1 of the French Civil Code, which is not the case here for the Security
Documents governed by French law. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will
not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit
indirectly from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a
“Parallel Debt.” Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim
equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may
not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the
Collateral. Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held(in a decision dated
September 13, 2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n° 10-25.533 Belvédère) rendered in the
context of safeguard proceedings opened in France) that, subject to certain conditions being
met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by the laws of the State of New York was not
incompatible with the French law concept of international public policy (ordre public
_international), this decision cannot be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in_
France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no
assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts.
There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate or mitigate the risk of
unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the Collateral
created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of
the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the
Collateral.

_Trustee_
Pledges governed by French law will be granted to the benefit of the Security Agent as trustee
for the holders of the Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and may
therefore not directly be granted to holders of the Notes. A concept of “trust” has been
recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis of the French Tax Code and the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation) has held, in the Belvédère decision referred to above in respect of the
parallel debt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the
State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in
France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not
ratified the La Haye Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their
recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

_Recognition of Validity of Second or Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by_
_French Courts_
The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second
or lower ranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a
pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which
the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security
interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de
_comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge_
over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the
securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from
granting a second or lower ranking pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the
shares of such a company will therefore provide that the possession of the securities account is

309


-----

transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as “tiers convenus” (entiercement), that the
first ranking and second or lower ranking secured parties have consented to the creation of
second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured parties have accepted their
appointment as tiers convenus and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of
both the first ranking and the second or lower ranking secured parties. This structure has not
been tested before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second or lower
ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower
ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively
registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially
adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an
enforcement event.

_Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Second Ranking Pledges Over Receivables_
The pledges over receivables are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are available
for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over receivables. As a result, no
assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the receivables of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over receivables from
granting a second ranking pledge over the same receivables, this structure has not been tested
before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges would
be upheld if tested.

_Fraudulent Conveyance_
French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside
insolvency proceedings, the “action paulienne” provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors
protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person
(including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the
performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any
of such person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside
insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du_
_plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant_
person outside insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of
recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared
unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation
to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s insolvency proceedings, any
creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time
the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should
have known that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced
in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit),
in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on
the grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant
of the Security Interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent
conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the
Notes, the granting of the Security Interests in the Collateral or the granting of such guarantee
could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the
creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful
challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the
Security Interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes
received with respect to the Notes, the Security Interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees
could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent
transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for
any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the
fraudulent conveyance.

310


-----

_Assumptions as to the Validity of the Intercreditor Agreement_
There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement
such as the Intercreditor Agreement, except for article L.626-30-2 of the French Commercial Code
which states that, in the context of safeguard proceedings, the safeguard plan which is put to the
committees of creditors takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of
subordination agreements between creditors which were entered into prior to the opening of
the safeguard proceedings. As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as
at the date of this offering memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot
rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

#### Luxembourg

LLAM (the “Luxembourg Guarantor”) is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and there
are assets located in Luxembourg which are subject to security interests.

**_Insolvency_**
The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to holders of Notes as insolvency
laws of other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. The Luxembourg Guarantor is
organized, and has its centre of main interests (centre des intérêts principaux), for the purposes
of the EU Insolvency Regulation, in Luxembourg. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings affecting
the Luxembourg Guarantor would be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. The following is
a brief description of the key features of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings and certain aspects
of insolvency laws in Luxembourg.

Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of insolvency proceedings (together
referred to as “Insolvency Proceedings”) may be opened against the Luxembourg Guarantor to
the extent that it has its registered office or its centre of main interests (centre des intérêts
_principaux) (for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in Luxembourg:_

- bankruptcy proceedings (faillite);

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée); and

- preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite).

In addition to these proceedings, the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive payment under
the Guarantees may be affected by a decision of the district court sitting in commercial matters
(Tribunal d’arrondissement siégeant en matière commerciale) (the “Commercial District Court”)
granting suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) or declaring the Luxembourg Guarantor in
judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire).

_Bankruptcy Proceedings (faillite)_

_General Administration of Bankruptcy Proceedings_
The opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be requested by the Luxembourg Guarantor, by any
of its creditors or by the Commercial District Court. Following such a request, the Commercial
District Court having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings in the event that the
Luxembourg Guarantor (a) has ceased to make payments (cessation de paiements) and (b) has
lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If the Commercial District Court
considers that these conditions are met, it may open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion,
absent a request made by the Luxembourg Guarantor or a creditor.

If the Commercial District Court declares a company bankrupt, it will appoint one or more
bankruptcy receivers (curateur(s)), depending on the complexity of the proceedings and a
supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to supervise the bankruptcy proceedings.

311


-----

The period within which creditors must file their proof of claims (déclaration de créance) is
specified in the judgment adjudicating the company bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may
nevertheless be taken into account by the bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to
distributable proceeds.

The bankruptcy receiver takes over the management and control of the Luxembourg Guarantor
in place of its management. The bankruptcy receiver will realize the Luxembourg Guarantor’s
assets and distribute the proceeds to the Luxembourg Guarantor’s creditors in accordance with
the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds left, to the bankrupt company’s
shareholders. The bankruptcy receiver(s) represent(s) the Luxembourg Guarantor as well as the
creditors collectively (masse des créanciers).

The bankruptcy receiver will need to obtain of the Commercial District Court permission for
certain acts, such as agreeing to a settlement of claims or deciding to pursue the business of the
Luxembourg Guarantor during the bankruptcy proceedings.

Bankruptcy is governed by public policy and rules, which generally delay the process and limit
restructuring options of the group to which the bankrupt company belongs.

On closing of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company will normally be dissolved.

_Effects of Bankruptcy Proceedings_
The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement
against the Luxembourg Guarantor, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured
creditors, and the payment of unsecured creditors of the Luxembourg Guarantor in accordance
with their rank upon the realization of the assets of the Luxembourg Guarantor.

In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on
commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency
of the company was crucial (intuitu personae agreements) for the other party. However, certain
contracts are terminated automatically by law, such as employment contracts, unless expressly
confirmed by the receiver. Contractual provisions purporting to terminate a contract upon
bankruptcy are generally held as being valid. The receiver may choose to terminate contracts of
the company subject to the rule of “exceptio non adimpleti contractus” and the creditors’
interest.

Unsecured claims of the Luxembourg Guarantor (such as the Luxembourg Guarantor’s liabilities
under the Guarantees) will, in the event of a liquidation of any of the Luxembourg Guarantor,
only rank after (i) the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such
liquidation) and (ii) the debts of the Luxembourg Guarantor that are entitled to priority under
Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg revenue;

- value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

- social security contributions; and

- remuneration owed to employees.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for
distribution to unsecured creditors of the Luxembourg Guarantor (except after enforcement and
to the extent a surplus is realized and subject to application of the relevant priority rules, liens
and privileges arising mandatorily by operation of law). During insolvency proceedings, all
enforcement measures by unsecured creditors of the Luxembourg Guarantor are suspended.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the
Luxembourg Guarantor during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is
fixed by the Commercial District Court and dates back not more than six months as from the date

312


-----

on which the Commercial District Court formally adjudicates a company bankrupt, and, as for
specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the
commencement of such period. In particular:

- pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some transactions (in particular,
the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts, save in respect of financial collateral
arrangements within the meaning of the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on collateral
arrangements, as amended (the “Collateral Act 2005”), the payment of debts which have not
fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any
other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or
by bill of exchange (unless, arguably, that method of payment was agreed from inception)),
transactions without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration entered into
during the suspect period or the ten days preceding it must be set aside, if so requested by the
bankruptcy receiver;

- pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are
subject to setting aside by the Commercial District Court upon proceedings initiated by the
bankruptcy receiver, if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of
payments; and

- pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the
Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the
granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time
limit.

_Controlled Management Proceedings (gestion contrôlée)_

_General Administration of Controlled Management Proceedings_
The Luxembourg Guarantor, which has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de
_crédit) or which is not in a position to completely fulfill its obligations, can apply for the regime_
of controlled management in order either (i) to restructure its business or (ii) to realize its assets
in good conditions. An application for controlled management can only be made by the
Luxembourg Guarantor.

The loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) is identical to the credit test
applied in bankruptcy proceedings. As to the second criteria (that is, the case where a company is
not in a position to completely fulfill its obligations), a broad view of the total situation of the
Luxembourg Guarantor is taken. Controlled management proceedings are only available for
good-faith debtor.

Controlled management proceedings are rarely used as they are not always successful and
generally lead to bankruptcy proceedings. They are occasionally applied to companies, in
particular holding or finance companies, which are part of an international group and whose
inability to meet obligations results from a default of group companies.

The proceedings are divided into three steps:

(1) The Luxembourg Guarantor must file an application with the Commercial District Court. The
Commercial District Court can reject the application because (i) the Luxembourg Guarantor has
already been declared bankrupt or (ii) the evidence brought forward by the Luxembourg
Guarantor does not ensure the stabilization and the normal exercise of the Luxembourg
Guarantor’s business or improve the realization of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s assets in better
conditions. If the application is upheld at this stage, the Commercial District Court will appoint an
investigating judge (juge délégué) to make a report on the overall situation of the Luxembourg
Guarantor.

313


-----

(2) Once the investigating judge has delivered a report, the Commercial District Court may
(i) turn down the application on the ground that the proposals made by the applicant are
unlikely to lead to the reorganization of the business or the realization of the assets in better
conditions or (ii) appoint one or more administrators (commissaires) who will supervise the
management of the assets of the Luxembourg Guarantor. If the Commercial District Court
ascertains that the Luxembourg Guarantor is unable to pay its creditors (i.e. the Luxembourg
Guarantor has ceased its paiements (cessation de paiements)), it may set the date as from which
the Luxembourg Guarantor will be deemed to have been in such situation. Such date may be set
up to six months prior to the filing of application for controlled management proceedings.
However, bankruptcy may only be declared if the two conditions for bankruptcy are met
(cessation of payment (cessation de paiements) and loss of commercial creditworthiness
(ébranlement de crédit)), and if the application has been dismissed either before or after
consideration of the report by the investigating judge or after the reorganization plan proposed
by the administrators (commissaires) at the third step described below. The administrators will
draw up the inventory of the assets as well as the financial situation of the Luxembourg
Guarantor. They are also in charge of the annual accounts of the Luxembourg Guarantor. The
administrators may also prescribe any act they consider to be in the interests of the applicant or
its creditors. The administrators have to be convened to any meeting of the board of directors.
They may attend all board meetings but have no voting rights. They have the right to convene
such board meetings.

(3) The administrators will draft a reorganization plan in respect of the applicant’s business or a
plan for realization of the assets, within the deadlines set forth by the Commercial District Court.
The plan shall equitably take into account all interests involved and will comply with the ranking
of mortgages (hypothèques) and privileges (privilèges) as required by law, without taking into
account any contractual clause regarding termination, penalties or acceleration. The
administrators will notify the draft plan to the creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. Within
fifteen days of such notification or publication, the creditors will inform the Commercial District
Court whether they agree or object to the draft plan. Any creditor who abstains will be
considered as having adhered to the plan. The creditors, the company, the joint debtors and the
guarantors may submit written observations to the Commercial District Court. The Commercial
District Court may (i) approve the plan if a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims
which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the Luxembourg
Guarantor’s liabilities have agreed thereto or (ii) disagree with the plan proposed by the
administrators even though a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have
not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the company’s liabilities have agreed
to such plan, in which case the application for controlled management will be dismissed or
(iii) ask the administrators to propose an amended plan (such amended plan will have to be
submitted again to the creditors). The judgment approving the plan will be binding upon the
company and its creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. The fees of the administrators will be
fixed by the Commercial District Court and will be borne by the company. The administrators
who at the same time are creditors of the applicant are not entitled to any fees.

_Effects of Controlled Management Proceedings_
As from the day of the appointment of the investigating judge and up to the final decision on
the application for controlled management, any subsequent enforcement proceedings or acts,
even if initiated by privileged creditors (including creditors who have the benefit of pledges
(gages) and mortgages (hypothèques)) are stayed, save as provided for by the Collateral Act
2005. The Luxembourg Guarantor may not enter into any act of disposition, mortgage and
contract or accept any movable asset without the authorization of the investigating judge.

Once the administrators have been appointed, the Luxembourg Guarantor may not carry out any
act (including receiving funds, lending money, granting any security, or making any payment)
without the prior authorization of the administrators. The administrators may bring any action
before the Commercial District Court in order to have any act made in violation of the legislation

314


-----

governing the controlled management or in fraud of the creditors’ rights be set aside. Subject to
the prior authorization of the Commercial District Court, they may bring an action (i) to have the
directors, managers or the statutory auditor be held liable or (ii) if the Commercial District Court
has declared the company to be in cessation of payments, to have certain payments,
compensations or security interests be set aside (under certain conditions set forth in Articles 445
et seq. of the Luxembourg code of commerce).

_Preventive Composition Proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite)_

_General Administration of Preventive Composition Proceedings_
The Luxembourg Guarantor may enter into a preventive composition proceedings (concordat
_préventif de la faillite) in order to resolve its financial difficulties by entering into an agreement_
with its creditors, the purpose of which is to avoid bankruptcy.

Preventive composition proceedings may only be applied for by a company which is in financial
difficulty. Similar to controlled management proceedings, the preventive composition
proceedings are not available if the company has already been declared bankrupt by the
Commercial District Court or if the company is acting in bad faith. The application for the
preventive composition proceedings can only be made by the Luxembourg Guarantor and must
be supported by proposals of preventive composition.

The Commercial District Court will delegate to a delegated judge (juge délégué) the duty to
verify, and to prepare a report on, the situation of the Luxembourg Guarantor. Based on such
report, the Commercial District Court will decide whether or not to pursue the preventive
composition proceedings. If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure should
not be pursued, it will in the same judgment declare the bankruptcy of the company (which
bankruptcy may also be declared during the preventive composition proceedings if the
conditions for the composition proceedings are not met). If the Commercial District Court
considers that the procedure may be pursued, it will set the place, date and hour of a meeting
(assemblée concordataire) at which the creditors will be convened. The delegated judge will
make its report at the assemblée concordataire.

The preventive composition may only be adopted if a majority of the creditors representing, by
their unchallenged claims, three-quarters of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s debt, has adhered to
the proposal and if the preventive composition has been homologated by the Commercial District
Court. Creditors benefiting from mortgages (hypothèques), privileges (privilèges) or pledges
(gages) only have a deliberating voice in the operations of the concordat, if they renounce the
benefit of their mortgages, privileges or pledges. The vote in favor of the concordat entails
renunciation. The renunciation may be limited by the secured creditors to only a portion (but
representing at least 50% in value) of their claims with corresponding voting rights.

The preventive composition has no effect on the claims secured by a mortgage, a privilege or a
pledge and on claims by the tax authorities. If the application results in a preventive composition
arrangement sanctioned by the Commercial District Court, the preventive composition could still
either be annulled (if it has not been executed) or terminated (in case of fraud or bad faith of
the company). In such scenarios, the Commercial District Court may adjudicate bankrupt the
Luxembourg Guarantor. The bankruptcy judgment can decide to set the date of cessation of
payment to the date of the application for the preventive composition proceedings. If that date
is less than six months prior to the bankruptcy judgment, the court can of course set the cessation
of payment date at six months prior to its judgment.

Preventive composition proceedings are rarely used in practice since they are not binding upon
secured creditors.

_Effects of a Preventive Composition Proceedings_
The Luxembourg Guarantor’s business activities continue during the preventive composition
proceedings. While the preventive composition is being negotiated, the Luxembourg Guarantor

315


-----

may not dispose of, or grant any security over, any assets without the approval of the delegated
judge. Once the preventive composition has been agreed by the Commercial District Court, this
restriction is lifted. However, the Luxembourg Guarantor’s business activities will still be
supervised by the delegated judge.

Except as provided for in Collateral Act 2005, while the preventive composition is being
negotiated, unsecured creditors may not take action against the company to recover their claims.
Secured creditors who do not participate in the preventive composition proceedings may take
action against the Luxembourg Guarantor to recover their claims and to enforce their security.
Fraudulent transactions which took place before the date on which the Commercial District Court
commenced preventive composition proceedings may be set aside (see the bankruptcy
proceedings section above).

_Suspension of Payments Proceedings (sursis de paiements)_

_General Administration of Suspension of Payments Proceedings_
A suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) for commercial companies is different from the
_sursis de paiement proceedings available for banks or insurance companies. It can only be applied_
to a company which, as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily
cease its payments but which has on the basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all
amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of payments may also be granted if the situation of
the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious elements of reestablishment of the
balance between its assets and its debts.

The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking
experiencing financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex
proceeding involving both the Commercial District Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and
the approval by a majority of the creditors representing, by their claims, three-quarters of the
company’s debts (excluding claims secured by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or
pledge (gage)).

The suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main
reasons it has lost its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed
by the debtor prior to obtaining the suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and
other public charges or secured claims (by right of privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are
concerned.

_Effects of Suspension of Payments Proceedings_
During the suspension of payments, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings
against the Luxembourg Guarantor or the Luxembourg Guarantor’s assets. This stay on
enforcement does not extend to preferred creditors, or to creditors which are secured by
mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial collateral arrangements governed by the
Collateral Act 2005. The Luxembourg Guarantor continues to manage its own business under the
supervision of a court-appointed administrator who must approve most of the transactions
carried out by the Luxembourg Guarantor.

When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the
Luxembourg Guarantor’s directors can run the business again.

_Judicial Liquidation_
Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against
companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation of the
Luxembourg commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial
companies, as amended (the “Companies Act 1915”).

The management of such judicial liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as
those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings.

**_Effects of Opening of Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings on Security Interests Governed by the_**
**_Collateral Act 2005_**
The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including
pledges) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable even if entered into during
the pre-bankruptcy period, against third parties including supervisors, receivers, liquidators and
any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation,
national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting anyone of the
parties, save in case of fraud.

**_Limitation on Guarantees Provided by Luxembourg Obligors_**
The Companies Act 1915, does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg
company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. It is generally held
that within a group of companies, the corporate interest (intérêt social) of each individual
corporate entity should, to a certain extent, be tempered by, and subordinated to, the interest of
the group. A reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily
conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary,
in proportion with the real financial means of the assisting company or have a reciprocal
character. A company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by
the company’s corporate objects (objet social) and is in the corporate interest (intérêt social) of
the company. The test regarding the guarantor’s corporate interest is whether the company that
provides the guarantee receives some consideration in return (such as an economic or commercial
benefit) and whether the benefit is proportional to the burden of the assistance. A guarantee
that substantially exceeds the guarantor company’ ability to meet its obligations to the
beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other creditors would expose its directors or managers to
personal liability. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the directors of the Luxembourg
company might incur criminal penalties based on the concept of misappropriation of corporate
assets (article 171-1 of the Companies Act 1915). It cannot be ruled out that, if the Commercial
District Court held that the relevant transaction constituted a misappropriation of corporate
assets or if it could be evidenced that the other parties to the transaction were aware of the fact
that the transaction was not for the corporate benefit of the Luxembourg company, the
transaction might be declared void or ineffective based on the concept of illegal cause (cause
_illicite). To mitigate these risks, the up-stream / cross-stream guarantees granted by a_
Luxembourg guarantor will be limited to a certain percentage of, among others, the relevant
company’s net worth (capitaux propres).

A guarantee granted by a Luxembourg company could, if submitted to a Luxembourg court,
depending on the terms of such guarantee, possibly be construed by such court as a suretyship
(cautionnement) and not as a first demand guarantee or an independent guarantee. Article 2012
of the Luxembourg civil code provides that the validity and the enforceability of a suretyship
(which constitutes an accessory obligation) are subject to the validity of the underlying
obligation. It follows that if the underlying obligations were invalid or challenged, it cannot be
excluded that the Guarantors which are incorporated in Luxembourg would be released from its
liabilities under the guarantee.

# Plan of Distribution

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase
Agreement”) to be dated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to
sell to each Initial Purchaser and each such Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly,
to purchase the Notes from the Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and
accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal
opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page
hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may
from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Offers and sales of the Notes
in the United States will be made by those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that are registered
broker-dealers under the Exchange Act, or in accordance with Rule 15a-6 thereunder. The Initial
Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to prospective investors and to
reject orders in whole or in part.

We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees or discounts for their
services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket
expenses.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes
and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in
addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to
payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have
agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or
guaranteed by, us during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and
including the date 45 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United
States to “qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with Rule 144A, and (ii) outside the
United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed with us that:

(i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the
Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us; and

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United
Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material
relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering
Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes
may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with

318


-----

any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession
this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of
the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

The Notes are new issues of securities for which there currently is no market.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as
permitted by applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not
obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be
discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In
addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S.
Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market for the Notes
will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a
particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to_
_sell the Notes will be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or around
the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business
days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the
date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under
Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum
or the next business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make
such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase
Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons
acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and
may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In
addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase
Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose
penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above
market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in
these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given
as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell_
_the Notes will be limited.” Additionally, the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates have_
committed to provide bridge financing in connection with the financing of the Acquisition in the
event that the Offering is not consummated.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial
advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage
activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in
the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial
banking services to the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they
have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, affiliates of each of the Initial

319


-----

Purchasers act as mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement. Natixis also acts as facility agent under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. Each
has received and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. J.P. Morgan
Securities plc and Natixis or their respective affiliates are also advising PAI in connection with the
Acquisition. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also enter into hedging
arrangements with us in connection with the Transactions.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or
related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own
account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may
involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their
affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either
the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, which
may include the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of
the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in
such securities and instruments.

# Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities

The Issuer is organized under the laws of France. Each of the Security Documents relating to the
Collateral will be governed by the laws of France or England and Wales, as applicable. The
Indenture with respect to the Notes (including the Guarantees) will be governed by New York
law. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will be governed by
the law of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and each of
the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive officers, are located
outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against either the Issuer or
a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated
upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the
United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will appoint an
agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York
courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or
under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or
on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including
actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against either of the Issuer or a Guarantor or a security
provider, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant
company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United
States is described below for the countries in which each of the Issuer and the Guarantors is
located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to
enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

#### France

Our French counsel has advised us that the United States and France are not parties to a treaty
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral
awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S.
federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or
enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings
(exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has
exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex
_parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil_
court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing
French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign
judgment):

- such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the
dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court and the French courts did not have
exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

- such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both
pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

- such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

323


-----

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial
decisions (i.e. those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law,
and that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment
that has become effective in France. Where proceedings are pending before French courts at the
time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and where these proceedings have the same or
similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment, the courts may stay the exequatur proceedings.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit
from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus
be declared enforceable in France after all remedies have been exhausted. However, the decision
granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely
affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by
French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000
(relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial,
industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or
restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to
comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or
French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data
files and individual liberties, as most recently modified by French Ordinance No. 2011 1012 of
August 24, 2011), as well as newly-adopted European Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 and
the Privacy Shield agreement between the EU and the U.S., can limit under certain circumstances
the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a
judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context, although the exact extent of these
restrictions is yet to be clarified.

Furthermore, we have been advised by our French counsel that if an original action is brought in
France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law or a part of foreign law designated by the
applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their
contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French
international public policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French courts) or in case of
overriding mandatory rules. Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S.
federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the
remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an
individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance
of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign
country with French persons. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national
can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of
obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant
(Article 15). These provisions also apply in the context of non-contractual obligations. For a long
time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either
claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other
than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French
nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a
jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not
fraudulent. More specifically, according to this recent case law, a French defendant can no longer
challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal on the basis of article 15 of the French civil code in
circumstances where the foreign tribunal has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, French and
foreign claimants may respectively waive their rights respectively to benefit from the provisions
of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily
appearing before the foreign court.

324


-----

The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a jurisdiction clause may
only be effective if it complies with the requirement of foreseeability. This can notably be the
case where the jurisdiction clause sets out an objective basis for the determination of the
competent courts. In this respect, a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent
jurisdiction, which, by definition, does not set out an objective basis for the determination of the
competent courts to be chosen by the latter party, is most likely to be considered by French
Courts as not complying with the requirement of foreseeability. In such case, French Courts
would find that the jurisdiction clause is not binding on the party submitted to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the court or does not prevent a French party from bringing an action before the
French courts, should they otherwise have jurisdiction.

#### Luxembourg

Foreign judgments need to obtain an exequatur by a Luxembourg court before they can be
enforced by a bailiff (huissier de justice).

The Luxembourg Guarantor has been advised by Loyens & Loeff Luxembourg S.à r.l., its
Luxembourg counsel, that, although there is no treaty between Luxembourg and the United
States regarding the reciprocal enforcement of judgments, a valid final and conclusive judgment
against the Luxembourg Guarantor with respect to the Guarantees obtained from a court of
competent jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment remains in full force and effect after
all appeals as may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have
been taken, may be recognized and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction of
Luxembourg subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures set out in Articles 678 et
seq. of the Luxembourg Nouveau code de procédure civile and applicable Luxembourg case law:

- the foreign judgment must be enforceable in the country of origin;

- the court of origin must have had jurisdiction both according to its own laws and to the
Luxembourg conflict of jurisdictions rules;

- the foreign proceedings must have been regular in light of the laws of the country of origin;

- the rights of defense must not have been violated;

- the foreign court must have applied the law which is designated by the Luxembourg conflict of
laws rules, or, at least, the judgment must not contravene the principles underlying these rules
(based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be
required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court);

- the considerations of the foreign judgment as well as the judgment as such must not
contravene Luxembourg international public policy; and

- the foreign judgment must not have been rendered as a result of or in connection with an
evasion of Luxembourg law (“fraude à la loi”).

The Luxembourg Guarantor has been also advised by Loyens & Loeff Luxembourg S.à r.l. that if
an original action is brought in Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law if the choice of the foreign law was
not made bona fide or if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or if pleaded and proved,
the foreign law was contrary to Luxembourg mandatory provisions (lois impératives) or
incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the
basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power
to grant the remedies sought.

Also, an enforcement procedure (exequatur) may be refused in respect of punitive damages. In
practice, Luxembourg courts now tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although
there is no clear statutory prohibition of such review.

To the President,

In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Cerba HealthCare and in compliance with your request,
we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Cerba HealthCare for
the year ended December 31, 2016 (“the consolidated financial Statements”).

The President is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the
professional guidance issued by the French Institute of statutory auditors (Compagnie nationale
des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing
procedures, on a test basis or by selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by management, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
position and assets and liabilities of the group constituted by the persons or entities included in
the consolidation as of December 31, 2016, and of the results of its operations for the year then
ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the
European Union.

This report is governed by French law. French courts have exclusive jurisdiction to judge any
dispute, claim or disagreement that may result from our letter of engagement or this report or
any related question. Each party irrevocably renounces his or her rights to oppose legal action
brought before these courts, to contend that the action was brought before a court that was not
competent, or that these courts do not have jurisdiction.

The Group is currently analysing the impact on its consolidated financial statements of the
standards published by the IASB at 31 December 2016 but not yet adopted by the EU but it does
not expect the impact to be material.

**6.3.2 Comparability of financial statements**
The accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements at 31 December
2016 are identical to those used for the consolidated statements at 31 December 2015.

As part of a consolidated reporting optimization process, some items presented in further detail
in 2016 and some terminology related to income statement line items was refined. These charges
do not impact the financial statements in aggregate.

**6.3.3 Basis of measurement**
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost principle,
except for derivative instruments, which are measured at fair value.

F-13


-----

Concerning the business combinations (See Note 6.4.1.1), when the Group acquires control of an
entity or group of entities, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized
and measured at fair value. The difference between the consideration transferred (i.e. the
acquisition cost) and the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, net of the liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill.

Goodwill is recorded directly in the statement of financial position of the acquired entity, in the
entity’s functional currency.

Its recoverable amount is subsequently monitored at the level of the cash-generating unit to
which the entity belongs.

**6.3.4 Functional and presentation currency**

The consolidated financial statements are presented in Thousands of Euros, the Company’s
functional currency, and rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise specified.

The functional currency of most foreign subsidiaries is their local currency, corresponding to the
currency in which the majority of their transactions are denominated.

The balance sheets of these subsidiaries are translated at the year-end exchange rate and their
income statements are translated on a monthly basis at the average exchange rate for each
month. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of financial statements of foreign
subsidiaries are recorded in equity under “Translation reserve”.

**6.3.5 Use of estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the
reported amount of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses. Actual amounts may differ from
these estimates.

Management bases these estimates and assumptions on past experience and the Group’s current
business environment and they are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The impacts of changes to
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and for all future
periods affected.

Estimates and assumptions are particularly important for measuring:

- the recoverable amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, especially
goodwill presented in notes 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14;

- obligations under defined benefit plans;

- deferred tax assets and liabilities.

#### 6.4 Significant accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in
the consolidated financial statements and by all Group entities.

**6.4.1 Basis of consolidation**

The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements include those of the parent company and
all of its subsidiaries for the period ended 31 December 2016. All of the subsidiaries close their
accounts on 31 December, except for CHCB (30 November).

The Group consolidates all entities over which it exercises exclusive control—either directly or
indirectly—using the full consolidation method. Entities over which the Group has significant
influence are accounted for using the equity method without applying any threshold in terms of
its interest and/or voting rights.

All material intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses are totally eliminated.

F-14


-----

All profits and losses generated by subsidiaries are broken out into the portion attributable to
owners of the Company and to non-controlling interests, based on their respective interests.

**_6.4.1.1 Business combinations_**

In accordance with Revised IFRS 3, business combinations acquired after to 1 January 2010 are
accounted for using the purchase method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which
control was transferred to the Group.

The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

- the fair value of the consideration transferred; (+)

- the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; (+)

- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity
interest in the acquiree; (-)

- the net recognised amount (in general the fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed.

Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is subsequently
adjusted through goodwill only when additional information is obtained after the acquisition
date about facts and circumstances that existed at that date.

Such adjustments are made only during the 12-month measurement period that follows the
acquisition date.

All other subsequent adjustments are recorded as a receivable or payable through profit or loss.

In the case of multi-step acquisitions, acquisition of control over the acquiree triggers
remeasurement of all previously-held equity interests at fair value and any material changes are
recognised in profit or loss from recurring operations.

Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the
Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Contingent consideration is recognised in equity if the contingent payment is settled by delivery
of a fixed number of the acquirer’s equity instruments; in all other cases, it is recognised in
liabilities related to business combinations. Contingent consideration is recognised at fair value
at the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. If the contingent consideration
was originally recognised as a liability, any subsequent adjustments are recognised in profit or
loss unless such adjustments are made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are related
to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Purchased goodwill is accounted for as
a business combination.

**_6.4.1.2 Acquisitions of non-controlling interests_**

Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their
capacity as owners. Therefore, no goodwill is recognised. Adjustments to non-controlling
interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are determined based
on the proportionate interest in the net assets of the subsidiary.

Operations that do not lead to a loss of control are treated as transactions between shareholders,
giving rise to a new split between equity attributable to owners of the Company and to
non-controlling interests. The same allocation basis is applied to any transaction costs.

**_6.4.1.3 Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. An investor controls an investee when it is
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

F-15


-----

French law sets regulatory constraints on the corporate structure and nature of ownership of the
share capital of clinical laboratories. Indeed, French subsidiaries are subject to strict regulations
limiting the ownership of clinical laboratories and the corporate form such laboratories can take.
French law requires that a majority of the voting rights of a laboratory company be held by
clinical pathologists working in the relevant laboratory. In addition, persons that are not clinical
pathologists or entities that are not laboratory companies may not own shares granting more
than 25% of the share capital in a laboratory company.

French law also dictates that clinical laboratories must take the corporate form of an SEL.

We have organized our corporate structure to remain in compliance with such regulations and
hold the majority of the related financial interests (see Note 6.5). Moreover, specific clauses,
especially concerning the governance structure, are included in the articles of association and
shareholders agreements.

Although the Group does not hold the majority of voting rights in the private practice
companies, the above-mentioned mechanisms allow it to obtain the majority of the economic
benefits derived from the activities of these companies and also to demonstrate the existence of
_de facto control in full compliance with French legislation, therefore enabling the French entities_
to be fully consolidated. As new French laboratories are acquired, similar shareholding structure
and shareholder agreement with clinical pathologists are put in place with the clinical
pathologists at the newly acquired laboratory.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that
control ceases (see Note 6.4.1.4). Divestment resulting in loss of control. Regulatory restrictions
on the ownership of our subsidiaries in Belgium and Luxembourg are much less stringent than
those imposed by French law.

**_6.4.1.4 Disvestment resulting in loss of control_**
Upon loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any
non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any
profit or loss arising on the loss of control is recognised in “Profit or loss from recurring
operations”.

If the Group retains any interest in its former subsidiary, said interest is measured at fair value at
the date that control is relinquished. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted
investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset, depending on the level of influence retained.

**_6.4.1.5 Transactions eliminated in consolidation_**
Intra-group balances and transactions and any income and expenses arising from intra-group
transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

**_6.4.1.6 Foreign currency transactions_**
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies of
the respective Group entities at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the
functional currency at the closing exchange rate.

Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in profit or loss.

**_6.4.1.7 Foreign operations_**
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations—including goodwill and fair value adjustments

using average exchange rates for the period.

The foreign currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are
recognised in “Other comprehensive income”. They are carried in the foreign currency
translation reserve in consolidated equity until the related investments are sold or wound up.

#### Notes to the consolidated income statement

 6.7 Net sales

Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value
of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual
volume discounts for hospitals after the elimination of intra-group sales.

Specialised clinical pathology and private clinical testing operations are carried out in clinical
laboratories. Revenue related to analyses/tests carried out is recognised when the report is
validated by the clinical pathologist (on the date results are given to the client).

Clinical trials are governed by contractual agreements providing for specific invoicing
arrangements at each stage. Revenue is recognised using the percentage-of-completion method.
Percentage of completion is measured on the basis of work performed.

Sales of services correspond to testing for patients, laboratories, hospitals and pharmaceutical
companies in three market segments (Cf Note 6.6).

Sales of goods include the sale of sampling kits for clinical trials.

payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is
not a business combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit;

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures insofar as it is
probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

F-22


-----

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates (and laws) that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the year-end and are expected to apply when the asset is
realised or the liability is settled.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Company takes into account the
impact of any uncertain tax positions and any additional taxes and interest that may be due.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax assets and liabilities and they relate to taxes levied by the same authority, either on the same
taxable entity or on different tax entities that intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on
a net basis, and realise their tax assets and settle their tax liabilities simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is only recognised for unused tax credits, tax losses and deductible
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and
reduced if it is no longer probable that taxable profit will be available against which they can be
used.

#### FINANCIAL POSITION-ASSETS

 6.12 Goodwill

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred
tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is
recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Assets are grouped together into the
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. For the purposes of goodwill
impairment testing, the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the
level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is
monitored for internal reporting purposes. CGUs are aggregated within operating segments.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to
benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Goodwill impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in
respect of CGUs are first allocated against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the
CGU (or group of CGUs), and then against the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU
(or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. For other assets, an impairment
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

**Subsequent measurement**
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs)
or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business
combination.

The CGUs or group of CGUs identified by the Group are as follows:

- Specialised clinical pathology CGU: this activity involves complex clinical testing and/or testing
requiring specific equipment that clients (hospitals, clinics, private or community laboratories)
do not have.

- France private clinical laboratory testing CGU and Belux private clinical laboratory testing CGU.

- Clinical trials CGU: conducting clinical trials (logistics, analyses, results) for pharmaceutical
companies and biotechnology firms during the drug development phase.

Business goodwill acquired during the period is recognised as part of goodwill.

The tests are performed at the level of cash generating unit (CGU) to which the assets belong.
CGUs are defined as the smallest identifiable Group of assets that generates cash inflows that are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

If a CGU’s recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised
in profit or loss and, to the extent possible, as an adjustment to the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the CGU.

The Goodwill broken down by CGU is as follows:

**Carrying amount at** **Acquisitions** **Acquisitions** **Goodwill** **Net book value at**
**(In millions of euro)** **31 December 2015** **or securities** **of businesses** **adjustements** **31 December 2016**

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **969.2** **12.1** **0.2** **0.8** **982.3**

In accordance with IAS 36, and considering the goodwill was tested for impairment at
31 December 2016, the Group didn’t identify any impairment on the different CGU. The
impairment tests were based on the value in use of each CGU calculated using the discounted
cash flow method as described before.

The main assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of the CGUs as of 31 December
2016 were the following:

**2016.12**

**Cash flow** **Long-term**
**Cash generating units** **projection period** **Discount rate** **growth rate**

Specialised clinical pathology CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 7.10% 3.00%
France clinical laboratory testing CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 7.10% 2.00%
Belux clinical laboratory testing CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 7.90% 2.80%
Clinical trial CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 9.40% 2.00%

**2015.12**

**Cash flow** **Long-term**
**Cash generating units** **projection period** **Discount rate** **growth rate**

Specialised clinical pathology CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 7.10% 2.00%
France clinical laboratory testing CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 7.30% 2.00%
Belux clinical laboratory testing CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 7.30% 2.20%
Clinical trial CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 10.20% 3.50%

Cash flows were discounted based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated on
the basis of the expected return and market risk for each CGU.

Impairment testing was carried out using the same procedures as in previous periods: key
modelling assumptions such as market multiples and the discount rate reflected stock market and
macro-economic trends. The resulting multiples are close to those of companies engaged in
businesses that are similar to those of the Cerba Group.

F-26


-----

The terminal value is calculated by discounting cash flows to long term, based on normalised cash
flows and a perpetuity growth rate, taking into account of market development potential and
competitive position. The discounted cash flows are compared to the sum of the goodwill and
the operating assets allocated to the CGU (intangible assets, items of property, plant and
equipment and components of working capital, net of deferred tax liabilities).

Testing and the cash flow calculation were based on the most recent medium-term plan (MTP),
covering the years 2017-2022 validated by management based on markets conditions at
December 2016.

The growth rates used to estimate the cash flows of the CGUs or Groups of CGUs are considerably
less than the Group’s average historical growth rates.

As a reminder, at 31 December 2014, an impairment loss of €22.6 million was recognised on the
specialised clinical pathology CGU following impairment testing after having lowered the
performance objectives of the business plan on this activity in addition to the impairment
recorded at 30 June 2012 of €48.5 million on the CGU “Specialised Clinical pathology”. On the
others CGU’s, no evidence of impairment has been identified.

The weighted average cost of capital and market multiples are adjusted based on business data
and the geographical location of the CGUs tested.

At 31 December 2016, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs or Groups of CGUs were higher than
their carrying amounts (cf Supra).

Sensitivity analyses have been performed on all of the CGUs and the results of testing the value
in use (of the groups of assets to which most goodwill is allocated) against changes in the various
assumptions used at 31 December 2016 are shown in the following table:

**Discount rate for** **Growth rate to** **Combination** **Existing**
**(In millions of euro)** **Test margin** **cash flows 0.5%** **infinity �0.5%** **of two factors** **accrual**

Specialised clinical
pathology CGU . . . . . . . 546.7 (77.7) (64.5) (133.1) (48.5)
France clinical laboratory
testing CGU . . . . . . . . . . 515.6 (64.6) (44.2) (133.3)
Belux clinical laboratory
testing CGU . . . . . . . . . . 54.2 (23.5) (18.6) (40.4)
Clinical trial CGU . . . . . . . . �4.2 (5.6) (4.4) (8.7) (22.6)

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1,112.3** **(171.4)** **(131.7)** **(315.5)** **(71.1)**

A decline in value in use following the application of the sensitivities indicated below either
separately or based on a combination of the two factors does not actually undermine the
carrying amount of goodwill.

Only the clinical trials CGU would be exposed to a slight risk of impairment in the unlikely event
of a simultaneous change in the two factors indicated.

#### 6.13 Other Intangible assets

**_1. Research and development_**
Expenditure on research activities to gain new scientific and technical knowledge and
understanding is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Development expenditure is expensed if the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset as
defined by IAS 38, are not met.

Under IAS 38—Intangible Assets, development expenditure must be recognised as an intangible
asset if the entity is able to demonstrate:

- its intention and its financial and technical ability to complete the development project;

F-27


-----

- that it is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the development
expenditure will flow to the entity; and

- that the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Gross capitalised development expenditure also includes borrowing costs.

**_2. Intangible assets_**
The intangible assets acquired by the Group that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

They include customer contractual relationships and order books acquired in business
combinations.

Development costs for internal use computer software for the part relating to internal or
external costs directly allocated to the creation or improvement of performance are capitalized in
the balance sheet when it is probable that these expenditures will be generated. All the
economic benefits of these costs are linearly amortized over the estimated useful life of the
software, which ranges from 1 to 3 years. Other acquisition costs and software development are
expensed as incurred.

**_3. Subsequent expenditure_**
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure
on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

**_4. Amortisation_**
Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives from the date that they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

- Patents and trademarks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years

- Contractual customer relationships (specialised clinical pathology CGU) . . . . . . . . . . . 19 years

- Order books (clinical trials CGU) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 years

- Clinical contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted where appropriate.

Intangible assets include contractual customer relationships and order books identified when the
Group was acquired by Cerba HealthCare.

Since 2015, the intangible assets include valuation of clinical contracts.

#### 6.14 Property, plant and equipment

**6.14.1 Tangible assets**

**_1. Recognition and measurement_**
In accordance with IAS 16, the gross carrying amount of an item of property, plant and
equipment corresponds to its acquisition or production cost and it is not revalued.

Capital expenditure grants are recognised as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the
asset for which they were granted.

Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When
components of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for
as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

F-29


-----

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the
difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is
recognised in profit or loss.

**_2. Subsequent costs_**
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits
associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. Repairs and maintenance are expensed
as incurred.

**_3. Depreciation_**
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each component. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain
ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and
ready for use or, in the case of self-constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed
and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

**6.14.2 Leases assets**

Assets under finance leases or arrangements that are in substance finance leases as defined by
IAS 17—Leases and IFRIC 4, respectively, are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet.

Leases under whose substance or form the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is
measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the
minimum lease payments.

After the initial accounting, the asset is subsequently accounted for in accordance with the
accounting policy applicable to this type of asset.

Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance
expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each
period over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability.

Other leases are operating leases and are not recognised as non-current assets.

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the
total lease expense, and as a reduction in rental expense over the term of the lease.

The Group has entered into a number of leases financing on the equipment, technical equipment
and the headquarters. Some of these contracts such as the provision of equipments correspond in
substance to the definition of financing agreements.

At 31 December 2016, the breakdown of fixed assets held under leases was as follows:

#### 6.15 Other non-current assets

The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date they originated.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in
which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised
as a separate asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and
intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly
attributable transaction costs and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less any impairment losses.

Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.

**_Impairment_**

A financial asset not classified as at fair value is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it may be impaired as a result of one or more events
that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset giving rise to a loss event with an impact
on the estimated future cash flows of the asset that can be estimated reliably.

Financial assets measured at amortised cost.

The Group considers evidence of impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost (loans
and receivables) both individually and collectively.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit
management processes. Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the basis of
historical data but provisions for doubtful debts are booked on a case by case basis. In the
specialised clinical pathology business, receivables from direct patients which are more than 35
days overdue are handled by a debt collection company.

In assessing collective impairment of receivables, the Group uses historical trends of the
probability of default, payment patterns and the amount of losses incurred in the past, adjusted
based on management’s assessment of whether current economic and credit conditions are such
that actual losses are likely to be greater or less than those suggested by historical trends.

An impairment loss on a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference
between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss under “Net change in amortisation and
impairment” with a matching entry in an allowance account for loans and receivables. Any
subsequent decrease in the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

#### 6.17 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, in accordance with IAS 2—
Inventories.

Costs are determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method and are measured at the lower of
cost and net realisable value.

The net realisable value of inventories intended to be sold corresponds to their selling price, as
estimated based on market conditions and any relevant external information sources, less the
estimated costs necessary to complete the sale.

Finished goods inventories, mainly comprising reagents and consumables, are recognised at
purchase cost, plus any directly attributable costs. They are measured on a VAT-inclusive basis less
the applicable pro rata VAT amounts.

The Group’s inventories includes reagents and consumables.

#### 6.18 Trade receivables

A provision for impairment is recognized on trade receivables of enterprises if the Group believes
that there is a risk that the debt will not be recovered.

The probable impairment clues that lead the Group to reflect on this point include the existence
of unresolved disputes, the age of receivables and significant financial difficulties of the debtor.

#### Financial position-liabilities

 6.21 Share capital

**Definitions**
**_Ordinary shares_**
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a
deduction from equity, net of any tax effect.

**_Preference shares_**
Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable or redeemable at the
Company’s discretion only, and the distribution of any dividends is also discretionary. Dividends
thereon are deducted directly from equity once they have been approved by the Company’s
shareholders at their general meeting.

All of the preference shares issued by the Group meet the definition of equity instruments.

**_Share-based payment_**
On 21 July 2010, the Company issued shares with warrants to senior executives and some Group
employees.

The issue was recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as a share-based payment and the warrants
were measured at fair value on the grant date.

The fair value of stock options is based on the exercise price and the expected life of the option;
the price of the underlying stock at the grant date; the expected volatility in the share price;
forecast dividends; and the risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.

This method results in a fair value of warrants that is equal to their issue price. The shares with
warrants have therefore been classified as equity at their issue cost. Since the issue price is equal
to the grant-date fair value, the corresponding expense in the income statement is nil.

On December 31th 2016, share capital comprised 43,216,872,407 shares with a par value of € 0.01
for an aggregate amount of € 432,168,724.07.

**6.21.1 Preference shares**
The Series A and B preference shares issued by Financière Gaillon 0 in November 2014 have the
following features:

- No voting rights (Art. 19.4 of the Articles of association).

- No rights to the Company’s profits (except for the preference dividend), assets, reserves,
distributions or liquidation surplus (Art. 22.1 of the Articles of association).

- Cumulative annual preference dividend equal to 10% of the subscription value of each Series A
and B share calculated as of 21 July 2010 and capitalised annually (Art. 22.1 of the Articles of
association).

- The Series A and B preference dividends may be adjusted in the event of market floatation or a
loss of controlling interest (Art. 22.2 of the Articles of association).

- No maturity date.

**6.21.2 Ordinary shares**
Each ordinary share carries one voting right at the general meetings of shareholders. Each share
entitles its owner to receive a share in the Company’s profits, assets, reserves, distributions or
liquidation surplus.

**6.21.3 Warrants**
On 21 July 2010, Cerba HealthCare issued 16 million shares with warrants for an aggregate
nominal value of €160,000. The share premium amounted to €15.84 million and the warrants to
€0.79 million.

F-37


-----

Each share has two warrants attached: warrant 1 valued at €0.015625 and warrant 2 at €0.03375.

Shares with warrants are reserved for senior executives and some Group company managers,
designated by the Commitments Board. The shares with warrants were issued at fair value as
determined by an expert.

They were measured at the grant-date fair value, which corresponds to their issue price.
Consequently, no expense was recognised under IFRS 2.

#### 6.22 Financial liabilities

The Group initially recognises debt securities and subordinated liabilities on the date they
originated.

Financial liabilities consist of borrowings and debt, in accordance with IAS 39.

Loans whose contractual rate of interest is tied to the Group’s business data are deemed to be at
a fixed rate (at the effective interest rate calculated at the inception of the loan).

In the event of a change in the underlying data used to calculate the effective interest rate, the
carrying amount of the loan is adjusted with a matching entry to finance costs.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations have been
discharged, cancelled or expired.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities as other financial liabilities. Such financial
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. They
are subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other
payables.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated
statement of cash flows.

Hybrid financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible bonds denominated in
euros that can be converted into a fixed number of shares.

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of
a similar liability that does not have a conversion option, by discounting the contractual cash
flows at a market rate. The equity component is recognised initially for the amount of the
difference between the proceeds from the issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value of
the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability
and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is subsequently remeasured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a hybrid financial instrument
is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition.

Interest and any gains and losses related to a financial liability are recognised in profit or loss.
Upon conversion of the bonds, the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is
recognised.

Financing arrangements set up when the Group was created are as follows:

- Convertible and non-convertible bonds, most of which bear interest at 10%, maturing on
21 July 2025. The Interests are capitalised annually. The majority of convertible bonds were
converted into shares following the decision of the General Shareholders’ Meeting of
11 December 2012 to increase the share capital of the holding company.

- Existing loans at 31 January 2012 were refinanced by the high-yield bonds issued on 31 January
2013, and 28 February 2015 and by the additional draw (see Note 6.2).

- The Group also has received financing from its shareholders in the form of non-convertible
bonds.

The Group’s subsidiaries have local medium-term credit facilities.

At 31 December 2016, the Group has incorporated into the High Yield debt the refinancing
impacts of the debt explained in note 6.10 knowing that the Debt repayment schedule is
established according to the terms of initial reimbursement. All refinancing impacts are registred
in the term “3 to 4 Years” in the Debt repayment schedule.

**6.22.2 Debts covenants**
The main financial liabilities are subject to certain conditions applied to the consolidated
financial statements and notably the ratio of net debt to gross operating profit (or EBITDA).

Following the refinancing operation of January 2013, new debt covenants were negotiated with
the Group’s banks, replacing the pre-existing covenants (see Notes 6.2).

As part of its Revolving Credit Facility, the Group is bound by two new covenants calculated
based on the consolidated accounts: Leverage ratio (Consolidated Total Net Debt / Consolidated
proforma EBITDA) and Percentage Test (contribution of the loan guarantors to consolidated
EBITDA and consolidated assets).

**6.23 Employee benefits**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each
plan by estimating the amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for services
provided in the current and prior periods, less any unrecognised past service costs and the fair
value of plan assets.

The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds with similar
maturities to the Group’s obligations denominated in the currency in which the benefits are
expected to be paid.

In accordance with Revised IAS 19—Employee Benefits, pensions and other post employment
benefits are measured by a qualified independent actuary using the projected unit credit
method.

Each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is
measured separately to build up the final obligation. The final obligation is then discounted to
present value. These calculations require the use of:

- projected retirement dates;

- a discount rate;

- an inflation rate;

- assumptions regarding future salary increases and staff turnover.

At each closing, the Group determines its discount rate on the basis of the most representative
yield on first class bonds with a duration equivalent to that of its commitments.

The assumptions of salary increase rates correspond to inflation assumptions and forecasts of
individual salary increases. In France, the assumption is an increase of inflation plus an individual
increase as the age of the employee.

The assumptions of mortality, staff turnover and retirement age at retirement are set identically
on all Group entity.

F-41


-----

Obligations are measured annually for the Group’s main plans and once every three years for
other plans unless changes in assumptions or significant changes in demographic data warrant
more frequent measurement.

For each defined benefit plan, the Group recognises a provision equal to the benefit obligation,
less the fair value of plan assets, actuarial gains and losses and any unrecognised past service cost.

Actuarial gains and losses arise on change in assumptions or differences between forecast and
actual data concerning the benefit obligation or the performance of plan assets.

The Group recognises deferred cumulative actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits in
equity and they are presented in “Other comprehensive income”.

- Other long-term employee benefits

The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than pension plans is
equal to the amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for services provided in the
current and prior periods. Other employee benefits mainly comprise seniority bonuses.

Actuarial gains/losses as well as the past services costs related to the long-term employee benefits
other than pensions are recognized immediately in the Profit and Loss.

- Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are
expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to
be paid in short-term cash bonuses or incentive-based profit-sharing plans if the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation to pay the amount as a result of past service provided by
the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

In certain countries excluding France, Group employees are entitled to supplementary pension
plans into which the Group pays annual contributions, and lump sum retirement indemnities paid
out once the employees retire. These take the form of either defined contribution or defined
benefit plans.

Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make
further contributions and the corresponding expense is recognised in profit or loss for the period.
All defined benefit plans concern France.

**6.23.1 Change in the present value of the net defined benefit obligation**
Changes in the Group’s net defined benefit obligation break down as follows, taking into
account the related plan assets totalling €521 thousand as of December 2016.

Assumptions used in calculating the provision for retirement and similar benefits have only to do

(1,5% vs 2% en 2015).

Income (Expense) recognised in profit or loss . . . . . . . . . . . . (772) (550)

This impact is recognised in full in profit or loss from recurring operations under “Personnel
expenses”.

Revised IAS 19 has had a minimal impact on the measurement of the Group’s employee benefit
obligations for 2016.

The only impact relates to financial income generated on plan assets (these assets concern
approximately 10% of the lump sum retirement indemnity benefit obligation) which is identical
to the rate used to discount liabilities, i.e., yield equivalent to the discount rate.

**6.23.3 Actuarial assumptions**
All of the Group’s various employee benefit obligations are regularly reviewed by actuaries in
accordance with IFRS standards using the projected unit credit method based on salaries at
retirement.

All actuarial gains and losses and adjustments relating to the limitation are recognised in the
reporting period in which they occur in accordance with Revised IAS 19.

Actuarial assumptions (i.e. the probability that active employees will continue to work in the
Group, mortality rates, retirement age, assumptions regarding future salary increases, etc.)
depend on the demographic and economic conditions in the countries in which the different
plans have been set up.

Discount rates used to determine the present value of benefit obligations are based either on the
government bond rate or on the yield on investment grade corporate bonds that are traded in
an active market with maturities that match the duration of the benefit obligation. In the
eurozone, discount rates have been calculated on software developed by independent actuaries.

Assumptions used in calculating the provision for retirement and similar benefits have only to do
with France.

#### 6.24 Provisions

In accordance with IAS 37—Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, a provision is
recognized when, at the reporting date, the Group has an obligation to a third party, and it is
likely or certain that an outflow of resources to this third party without equivalent consideration
of such third parties.

In application of IFRIC—21 Levies charged by public authorities, taxes levied by public authorities
are recognised as of the date of their tax generating event.

-----

The Group does not provide details of these provisions, considering that the disclosure of the
amount of the provision for litigation is such as to cause the Group serious prejudice.

Some litigation has not been provisioned because the Group considers that the risk is not proven
in support of its legal and tax advice.

rate risk exposure. They are not eligible for hedge accounting under IAS 39 and consequently,
any fair value adjustments are recognised in profit or loss (see Note 6.10).

#### Additional informations

 6.28 Financial instruments

**6.28.1 Financial risk management**
**_6.28.1.1 Introduction_**
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising on its financial instruments:

- Credit risk

- Liquidity risk

- Market risk

This note presents information on the Group’s exposure to each of the above-mentioned risks,
and its objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk, and capital
management.

**_6.28.1.2 Risk management framework_**
The Supervisory Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the
Group’s risk management framework.

The Group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the
Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to
predetermined limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect
changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and
management standards and procedures, aims to develop a rigorous and effective control
environment in which all employees understand their roles and responsibilities.

The Audit Committee oversees implementation of Group risk management policies and
procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks
faced by the Group.

**6.28.2 Credit risk**
Credit risk is managed at Group level. It is the risk of financial loss for the Group if a client or
counterparty should fail to meet its contractual payment obligations.

Credit risk concerns cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with
banks and financial institutions, as well as exposure to customer credit risk on outstanding
receivables.

In the specialised clinical pathology business, the collection of receivables from direct patients,
which are more than 35 days overdue, is handled by a debt collection company acting solely as a
collection agent on behalf of Cerba. Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the
basis of historical data.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit
management processes.

Trade receivables are disclosed in the financial statements and amounted to € 60 million at
31 December 2016, stable compared to December 2015.

The carrying amount of loans and receivables represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at
the reporting date.

**_6.28.2.1 Trade and other receivables_**

The Group believes that it is neither exposed to material credit risk nor to over dependence on a
specific customer due to its broad customer base, with customers located mainly in Europe.

**_6.28.2.2 Impairment losses_**

Cumulative impairment of trade and other receivables increase to € 8.973 million versus
€ 7.413 million in 2015. Provisions for impairment are mainly related to France area.

**6.28.3 Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk of the Group encountering difficulties in meeting the obligations
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash or other financial assets. The
Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it always has
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and “challenging”
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or damaging the Group’s reputation.

**6.28.4 Market risk**
Market risk includes the risk of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest
rates and equity instrument prices affecting the Group’s profit or the value of its financial
instruments. The objective of market risk management is to contain market risk exposures within
acceptable thresholds, while optimising returns.

**_6.28.4.1 Currency risk_**
The Group’s financial performance is not materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations since
a significant portion of operations takes place within the eurozone and income and expenses are
generally denominated in the similar currency.

**_6.28.4.2 Interest Rate risk_**
The Group’s financing has been contracted at fixed rates and notably the high-yield bond issue of
31 January 2013, the Additionnal High-yield bond of May 2014, the Senior Secure note on 28[th]

February 2015 and the Additionnal High-yield bond of October 2016 for €40 million.

Therefore, the Group is less exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its floating interest rate bank
loans than in previous years.

The Group contracts interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate risk. Only Laboratoire
Cerba is still effected as Cerba HealthCare settled its positions following refinancing of the
Group’s debt in early 2013.

The carrying amount of the derivative financial instruments used to hedge interest rate risk is
presented below:

These interest rate swaps are economic hedges of interest rate risk on loans and borrowings; they
have not been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

**6.28.5 Capital management**
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base to ensure the Group’s independence and
support future development of the business. Capital consists of ordinary shares, non-redeemable
preferred shares and retained earnings. The Supervisory Board monitors the return on equity.

The fair value of trade receivables and trade payables is the amount reported in the statement of
financial position, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The same applies to
other receivables and payables.

The fair value of swaps corresponds to their valuation by their issuing bank. Financial liabilities
are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s bank loans are
contracted at variable rates based on Euribor and their fair value is deemed to correspond to
their value at the closing date.

**_6.28.6.2 Fair value hierarchy_**
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels have been defined as follows:

- Level 1: fair value is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities.

- Level 2: fair value is measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e. inferred
from observable prices).

- Level 3: fair value is measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

To the President,

In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Cerba HealthCare and in compliance with your request,
we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Cerba HealthCare for
the year ended December 31, 2015 (“the consolidated financial Statements”).

The President is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the
professional guidance issued by the French Institute of statutory auditors (Compagnie nationale
des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing
procedures, on a test basis or by selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by management, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
position and assets and liabilities of the group constituted by the persons or entities included in
the consolidation as of December 31, 2015, and of the results of its operations for the year then
ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the
European Union.

This report is governed by French law. French courts have exclusive jurisdiction to judge any
dispute, claim or disagreement that may result from our letter of engagement or this report or
any related question. Each party irrevocably renounces his or her rights to oppose legal action
brought before these courts, to contend that the action was brought before a court that was not
competent, or that these courts do not have jurisdiction.

acquisition of Novescia Group by the entity “Financière de l’Equerre 1”.

- The loan was issued for € 85M by Cerba HealthCare (interest 7%, due 2020) and € 145 million
by Cerberus Nightingale 1 (interest at 8.25% due 2020)

- The € 145M borrowed by Cerberus Nightingale 1 were re-loaned to Cerba HealthCare via
Cerberus Nightingale 2 (interest at 8.50% due 2020).

The Effective deadline is fixed at January 31, 2020 equivalent to the older High-Yield bonds.

#### 6.3 Basis of preparation

The Group is currently analysing the impact on its consolidated financial statements of the
standards published by the IASB at 31 December 2015 but not yet adopted by the EU but it does
not expect the impact to be material.

**6.3.2 Comparability of financial statements**

The accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements at 31 December
2015 are identical to those used for the consolidated statements at 31 December 2014.

As part of a consolidated reporting optimization process, some items were detailed in 2015 and
refining in terms of accounting position in the income statement but have no effect on the
aggregates of our financial statements.

**6.3.3 Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost principle,
except for derivative instruments, which are measured at fair value.

Concerning the business combinations (See Note 6.4.1.1), the Group acquires control of an entity
or group of entities, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized and
measured at fair value. The difference between the consideration transferred (i.e. the acquisition
cost) and the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, net of the liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill.

Goodwill is recorded directly in the statement of financial position of the acquired entity, in the
entity’s functional currency.

Its recoverable amount is subsequently monitored at the level of the cash-generating unit to
which the entity belongs.

**6.3.4 Functional and presentation currency**

The consolidated financial statements are presented in Thousands of Euros, the Company’s
functional currency, and rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise specified.

The functional currency of most foreign subsidiaries is their local currency, corresponding to the
currency in which the majority of their transactions are denominated.

The balance sheets of these subsidiaries are translated at the year-end exchange rate and their
income statements are translated on a monthly basis at the average exchange rate for each
month. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of financial statements of foreign
subsidiaries are recorded in equity under “Translation reserve”.

**6.3.5 Use of estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the
reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual amounts may differ from
these estimates.

Management bases these estimates and assumptions on past experience and the Group’s current
business environment and they are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The impacts of changes to
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and for all future
periods affected.

Estimates and assumptions are particularly important for measuring:

- the recoverable amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, especially
goodwill presented in notes 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14;

- obligations under defined benefit plans ;

- deferred tax assets and liabilities.

#### 6.4 Significant accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in
the consolidated financial statements and by all Group entities.

**6.4.1 Basis of consolidation**
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements include those of the parent company and
all of its subsidiaries for the period ended 31 December 2015. All of the subsidiaries close their
accounts on 31 December, except for CRI (30 November).

The Group consolidates all entities over which it exercises exclusive control—either directly or
indirectly—using the full consolidation method. Entities over which the Group has significant
influence are accounted for using the equity method without applying any threshold in terms of
its interest and/or voting rights.

All material intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses are totally eliminated.

All profits and losses generated by subsidiaries are broken out into the portion attributable to
owners of the Company and to non-controlling interests, based on their respective interests.

**6.4.1.1 Business combinations**
In accordance with Revised IFRS 3, business combinations acquired after to 1 January 2010 are
accounted for using the purchase method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which
control was transferred to the Group.

The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

- the fair value of the consideration transferred; (+)

- the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; (+)

- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity
interest in the acquiree; (-)

- the net recognised amount (in general the fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed.

Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is subsequently
adjusted through goodwill only when additional information is obtained after the acquisition
date about facts and circumstances that existed at that date.

Such adjustments are made only during the 12-month measurement period that follows the
acquisition date.

All other subsequent adjustments are recorded as a receivable or payable through profit or loss.

In the case of multi-step acquisitions, acquisition of control over the acquiree triggers
remeasurement of all previously-held equity interests at fair value and any material changes are
recognised in profit or loss from recurring operations.

Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the
Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Contingent consideration is recognised in equity if the contingent payment is settled by delivery
of a fixed number of the acquirer’s equity instruments; in all other cases, it is recognised in
liabilities related to business combinations. Contingent consideration is recognised at fair value
at the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. If the contingent consideration
was originally recognised as a liability, any subsequent adjustments are recognised in profit or
loss unless such adjustments are made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are related
to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Purchased goodwill is accounted for as
a business combination.

**6.4.1.2 Acquisitions of non-controlling interests**
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their
capacity as owners. Therefore, no goodwill is recognised. Adjustments to non-controlling

F-69


-----

interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are determined based
on the proportionate interest in the net assets of the subsidiary.

Operations that do not lead to a loss of control are treated as transactions between shareholders,
giving rise to a new split between equity attributable to owners of the Company and to
non-controlling interests. The same allocation basis is applied to any transaction costs.

**6.4.1.3 Subsidiaries**
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. An investor controls an investee when it is
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

French legislation requires laboratories to be incorporated as private practice companies (Société
_d’Exercice Libéral—SEL) and the clinical pathologists operating the private practice companies to_
hold at least 50% of the voting rights at shareholders’ annual general meetings. In strict
compliance with these regulations, the Group has created a capital structure to meet these
obligations and hold the majority of the related financial interests (see Note 6.5). Moreover,
specific clauses, especially concerning the governance structure, are included in the articles of
association and shareholders agreements.

Although the Group does not hold the majority of voting rights in the private practice
companies, the above-mentioned mechanisms allow it to obtain the majority of the economic
benefits derived from the activities of these companies and also to demonstrate the existence of
_de facto control in full compliance with French legislation, therefore enabling the French entities_
to be fully consolidated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that
control ceases (see Note 6.4.1.4). Divestment resulting in loss of control

**6.4.1.4 Disvestment resulting in loss of control**
Upon loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any
non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any
profit or loss arising on the loss of control is recognised in “Profit or loss from recurring
operations”.

If the Group retains any interest in its former subsidiary, said interest is measured at fair value at
the date that control is relinquished. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted
investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset, depending on the level of influence retained.

**6.4.1.5 Transactions eliminated in consolidation**
Intra-group balances and transactions and any income and expenses arising from intra-group
transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

**6.4.1.6 Foreign currency transactions**
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies of
the respective Group entities at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the
functional currency at the closing exchange rate.

Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in profit or loss.

**6.4.1.7 Foreign operations**
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations—including goodwill and fair value adjustments
arising on acquisitions—whose functional currency is not the euro, are translated into euros at
the closing exchange rate, and their statements of comprehensive income are translated into
euros using average exchange rates for the period.

The foreign currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are
recognised in “Other comprehensive income”. They are carried in the foreign currency
translation reserve in consolidated equity until the related investments are sold or wound up.

F-70


-----

**6.4.2 Financial instruments**
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are presented in accordance with IAS 39.

They are broken out into their current and non-current portion, depending on whether they
mature in under or over one year.

In accordance with IAS 39, the obligating event is recognition in the balance sheet at the
transaction date: if there is a time-lag between the transaction date (i.e., the obligation) and the
settlement date, securities deliverable or receivable are recognised from the transaction date.

#### Notes to the consolidated income statement

**6.7 Net sales**

Sales of services correspond to testing for patients, laboratories, hospitals and pharmaceutical
companies in three market segments (Cf Note 6.6).

Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value
of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual
volume discounts for hospitals after the elimination of intra-group sales.

Specialised clinical pathology and private clinical testing operations are carried out in clinical
laboratories. Revenue related to analyses/tests carried out is recognised when the report is
validated by the clinical pathologist (on the date results are given to the client).

Clinical trials are governed by contractual agreements providing for specific invoicing
arrangements at each stage. Revenue is recognised using the percentage-of-completion method.
Percentage of completion is measured on the basis of work performed.

Sales of goods include the sale of sampling kits for clinical trials.

#### 6.11 Income tax

**6.11.1 Breakdown between current and deferred tax**
Income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax recognised in accordance with IAS 12. Current
tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit and loss unless they relate to a business
combination, or to items that are recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable profit or tax loss for the period,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.

F-76


-----

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts and tax base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is
not a business combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit;

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures insofar as it is
probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates (and laws) that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the year-end and are expected to apply when the asset is
realised or the liability is settled.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Company takes into account the
impact of any uncertain tax positions and any additional taxes and interest that may be due.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax assets and liabilities and they relate to taxes levied by the same authority, either on the same
taxable entity or on different tax entities that intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on
a net basis, and realise their tax assets and settle their tax liabilities simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is only recognised for unused tax credits, tax losses and deductible
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and
reduced if it is no longer probable that taxable profit will be available against which they can be
used.

#### Financial position-assets

 6.12 Goodwill

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred
tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is
recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Assets are grouped together into the
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. For the purposes of goodwill
impairment testing, the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the
level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is
monitored for internal reporting purposes. CGUs are aggregated within operating segments.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to
benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Goodwill impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in
respect of CGUs are first allocated against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the

F-78


-----

CGU (or group of CGUs), and then against the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU
(or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. For other assets, an impairment
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

**_Subsequent measurement_**
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs)
or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business
combination.

The CGUs or group of CGUs identified by the Group are as follows:

- Specialised clinical pathology CGU: this activity involves complex clinical testing and/or testing
requiring specific equipment that clients (hospitals, clinics, private or community laboratories)
do not have.

- France private clinical laboratory testing CGU and Belux private clinical laboratory testing CGU.

- Clinical trials CGU: conducting clinical trials (logistics, analyses, results) for pharmaceutical
companies and biotechnology firms during the drug development phase.

Business goodwill acquired during the period is recognised as part of goodwill.

The €297,1 million increase in the gross value of goodwill relates to goodwill on acquisitions of
securities and companies during the period (see Note 6.2). €1,4 million increase is due to
acquisitions of commercial property.

The tests are performed at the level of cash generating unit (CGU) to which the assets belong.
CGUs are defined as the smallest identifiable Group of assets that generates cash inflows that are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

If a CGU’s recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised
in profit or loss and, to the extent possible, as an adjustment to the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the CGU.

In accordance with IAS 36, and considering the goodwill was tested for impairment at
31 December 2015, the Group didn’t’ identified any impairment on the different CGU. The
impairment tests were based on the value in use of each CGU calculated using the discounted
cash flow method as described before.

The main assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of the CGUs as of 31 December
2015 were the following:

**2015.12**

**Cash flow projection** **Long-term growth**
**Cash generating units** **period** **Discount rate** **rate**

**2014.12**

Clinical trial CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 10.10% 3.50%

Cash flows were discounted based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated on
the basis of the expected return and market risk for each CGU.

Impairment testing was carried out using the same procedures as in previous periods: key
modelling assumptions such as market multiples and the discount rate reflected stock market and
macro-economic trends.The resulting multiples are close to those of companies engaged in
businesses that are similar to those of the Cerba Group.

The terminal value is calculated by discounting cash flows to long term, based on normalised cash
flows and a perpetuity growth rate, taking into account of market development potential and
competitive position. The discounted cash flows are compared to the sum of the goodwill and
the operating assets allocated to the CGU (intangible assets, items of property, plant and
equipment and components of working capital, net of deferred tax liabilities).

F-81


-----

Testing and the cash flow calculation were based on the most recent medium-term plan (MTP),
covering the years 2016-2021 validated by management based on markets conditions at
December 2015.

The growth rates used to estimate the cash flows of the CGUs or Groups of CGUs are considerably
less than the Group’s average historical growth rates.

At 31 December 2014, an impairment loss of €22.6 million was recognised on the specialised
clinical pathology CGU following impairment testing after having lowered the performance
objectives of the business plan on this activity in addition to the impairment recorded at 30 June
2012 of €48.5 million on the CGU “Specialised Clinical pathology”. On the others CGU’s, no
evidence of impairment has been identified.

The weighted average cost of capital and market multiples are adjusted based on business data
and the geographical location of the CGUs tested.

At 31 December 2015, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs or Groups of CGUs were higher than
their carrying amounts except on the CGU “Clinical Trial”(cf Supra)

Sensitivity analyses have been performed on all of the CGUs and the results of testing the value
in use (of the groups of assets to which most goodwill is allocated) against changes in the various
assumptions used at 31 December 2015 are shown in the following table:

**(In millions of** **Discount rate for cash** **Growth rate to** **Combination of two**

A decline in value in use following the application of the sensitivities indicated below either
separately or based on a combination of the two factors does not actually undermine the
carrying amount of goodwill.

Only the clinical trials CGU would be exposed to a slight risk of impairment in the unlikely event
of a simultaneous change in the two factors indicated

#### 6.13 Other Intangible assets

**_1. Research and development_**
Expenditure on research activities to gain new scientific and technical knowledge and
understanding is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Development expenditure is expensed if the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset as
defined by IAS 38, are not met.

F-82


-----

Under IAS 38—Intangible Assets, development expenditure must be recognised as an intangible
asset if the entity is able to demonstrate:

- its intention and its financial and technical ability to complete the development project;

- that it is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the development
expenditure will flow to the entity; and

- that the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Gross capitalised development expenditure also includes borrowing costs.

**_2. Intangible assets_**
The intangible assets acquired by the Group that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

They include customer contractual relationships and order books acquired in business
combinations.

Development costs for internal use computer software for the part relating to internal or
external costs directly allocated to the creation or improvement of performance, are capitalized
in the balance sheet when it is probable that these expenditures will be generated. All the
economic benefits of these costs are linearly amortized over the estimated useful life of the
software, which ranges from 1 to 3 years. Other acquisition costs and software development are
expensed as incurred.

**_3. Subsequent expenditure_**
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure
on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

**_4. Amortisation_**

Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives from the date that they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

- Patents and trademarks 10 years

- Software 1-3 years

- Contractual customer relationships (specialised clinical pathology CGU) 19 years

- Order books (clinical trials CGU) 4 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted where appropriate.

Intangible assets include contractual customer relationships and order books identified when the
Group was acquired by Cerba HealthCare.

Since 2015, the intangible assets include valuation of clinical contracts.

#### 6.14 Property, plant and equipment

**6.14.1 Tangible assets**

**_1. Recognition and measurement_**
In accordance with IAS 16, the gross carrying amount of an item of property, plant and
equipment corresponds to its acquisition or production cost and it is not revalued.

Capital expenditure grants are recognised as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the
asset for which they were granted.

F-84


-----

Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When
components of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for
as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the
difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is
recognised in profit or loss.

**_2. Subsequent costs_**
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits
associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. Repairs and maintenance are expensed
as incurred.

**_3. Depreciation_**
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each component. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain
ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and
ready for use or, in the case of self-constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed
and ready for use.
The estimated useful lives of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

- Buildings 20 years

- Plant and equipment 5-10 years

- Fixtures and fittings 5-10 years

- Equipment and tooling 5 years

- Transport equipment 4-5 years

- Office and IT equipment 3-5 years

- Furniture 5-10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted where appropriate.

#### 6.14.2 Leases assets

Assets under finance leases or arrangements that are in substance finance leases as defined by
IAS 17—Leases and IFRIC 4, respectively, are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet.

Leases under whose substance or form the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is
measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the
minimum lease payments.

After the initial accounting, the asset is subsequently accounted for in accordance with the
accounting policy applicable to this type of asset.

F-86


-----

Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance
expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each
period over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability.

Other leases are operating leases and are not recognised as non-current assets.

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the
total lease expense, and as a reduction in rental expense over the term of the lease.

The Group has entered into a number of lease financing on the equipment, technical equipment
and the headquarters. Some of these contracts such as the provision of equipments correspond in
substance to the definition of financing agreements.

At 31 December 2015, the breakdown of fixed assets held under leases was as follows:

#### 6.15 Other non-current assets

The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date they originated.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in
which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised
as a separate asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and
intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly
attributable transaction costs and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less any impairment losses.

Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.

**_Impairment_**
A financial asset not classified as at fair value is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it may be impaired as a result of one or more events

that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset giving rise to a loss event with an impact
on the estimated future cash flows of the asset that can be estimated reliably.

Financial assets measured at amortised cost.

The Group considers evidence of impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost (loans
and receivables) both individually and collectively.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit
management processes. Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the basis of
historical data but provisions for doubtful debts are booked on a case by case basis. In the
specialised clinical pathology business, receivables from direct patients which are more than 35
days overdue are handled by a debt collection company.

In assessing collective impairment of receivables, the Group uses historical trends of the
probability of default, payment patterns and the amount of losses incurred in the past, adjusted
based on management’s assessment of whether current economic and credit conditions are such
that actual losses are likely to be greater or less than those suggested by historical trends.

An impairment loss on a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference
between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss under “Net change in amortisation and
impairment” with a matching entry in an allowance account for loans and receivables. Any
subsequent decrease in the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

#### 6.17 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, in accordance with IAS 2—
Inventories.

Cost is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method and are measured at the lower of cost
and net realisable value.

F-89


-----

The net realisable value of inventories intended to be sold corresponds to their selling price, as
estimated based on market conditions and any relevant external information sources, less the
estimated costs necessary to complete the sale.

Finished goods inventories, mainly comprising reagents and consumables, are recognised at
purchase cost, plus any directly attributable costs. They are measured on a VAT-inclusive basis less
the applicable pro rata VAT amounts.

The Group’s inventories includes reagents and consumables.

#### 6.18 Trade receivables

A provision for impairment is recognized on trade receivables of enterprises if the Group believes
that there is a risk that the debt will not be recovered.

The probable impairment clues that lead the Group to reflect on this point include the existence
of unresolved disputes, the age of receivables and significant financial difficulties of the debtor.

#### Financial position-liabilities

 6.21 Share capital

**Definitions**
**_Ordinary shares_**
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a
deduction from equity, net of any tax effect.

F-91


-----

**_Preference shares_**
Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable, or redeemable at the
Company’s discretion only, and the distribution of any dividends is also discretionary. Dividends
thereon are deducted directly from equity once they have been approved by the Company’s
shareholders at their general meeting.

All of the preference shares issued by the Group meet the definition of equity instruments.

**_Share-based payment_**
On 21 July 2010, the Company issued shares with warrants to senior executives and some Group
employees.

The issue was recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as a share-based payment and the warrants
were measured at fair value on the grant date.

The fair value of stock options is based on the exercise price and the expected life of the option;
the price of the underlying stock at the grant date; the expected volatility in the share price;
forecast dividends; and the risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.

This method results in a fair value of warrants that is equal to their issue price. The shares with
warrants have therefore been classified as equity at their issue cost. Since the issue price is equal
to the grant-date fair value, the corresponding expense in the income statement is nil.

On December 31th 2015, share capital comprised 43,216,872,407 shares with a par value of € 0.01
for an aggregate amount of € 432,168,724.07.

- Cumulative annual preference dividend equal to 10% of the subscription value of each Series A
and B share calculated as of 21 July 2010 and capitalised annually (Art. 22.1 of the Articles of
association).

- The Series A and B preference dividends may be adjusted in the event of a market floatation or
a loss of controlling interest (Art. 22.2 of the Articles of association).

- No maturity date.

**6.21.2 Ordinary shares**

Each ordinary share carries one voting right at the general meetings of shareholders. Each share
entitles its owner to receive a share in the Company’s profits, assets, reserves, distributions or
liquidation surplus.

**6.21.3 Warrants**

On 21 July 2010, Cerba HealthCare issued 16 million shares with warrants for an aggregate
nominal value of €160,000. The share premium amounted to €15.84 million and the warrants to
€0.79 million.

Each share has two warrants attached: warrant 1 valued at €0.015625 and warrant 2 at €0.03375.

Shares with warrants are reserved for senior executives and some Group company managers,
designated by the Commitments Board. The shares with warrants were issued at fair value as
determined by an expert.

They were measured at the grant-date fair value, which corresponds to their issue price.
Consequently, no expense was recognised under IFRS 2.

#### 6.22 Financial liabilities

The Group initially recognises debt securities and subordinated liabilities on the date they
originated.
Financial liabilities consist of borrowings and debt, in accordance with IAS 39.

Loans whose contractual rate of interest is tied to the Group’s business data are deemed to be at
a fixed rate (at the effective interest rate calculated at the inception of the loan).

In the event of a change in the underlying data used to calculate the effective interest rate, the
carrying amount of the loan is adjusted with a matching entry to finance costs.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations have been
discharged, cancelled or expired.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities as other financial liabilities. Such financial
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. They
are subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other
payables.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated
statement of cash flows.

Hybrid financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible bonds denominated in
euros that can be converted into a fixed number of shares.

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of
a similar liability that does not have a conversion option, by discounting the contractual cash
flows at a market rate. The equity component is recognised initially for the amount of the
difference between the proceeds from the issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value of
the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability
and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

F-93


-----

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is subsequently remeasured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a hybrid financial instrument
is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition.

Interest and any gains and losses related to the financial liability are recognised in profit or loss.
Upon conversion of the bonds, the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is
recognised.

Financing arrangements set up when the Group was created were as follows:

- Convertible and non-convertible bonds, most of which bear interest at 10%, maturing on
21 July 2025. The Interests are capitalised annually. The majority of convertible bonds were
converted into shares following the decision of the General Shareholders’ Meeting of
11 December 2012 to increase the share capital of the holding company.

- Existing loans at 31 January 2012 were refinanced by the high-yield bonds issued on 31 January
2013, on 28 February 2015 and by the additional draw (see Note 6.2).

- The Group has also received financing from its shareholders in the form of non-convertible
bonds.

The Group’s subsidiaries have local medium-term credit facilities.

**6.22.2 Debts covenants**
The main financial liabilities are subject to certain conditions applied to the consolidated
financial statements and notably the ratio of net debt to gross operating profit (or EBITDA).

Following the refinancing operation of January 2013, new debt covenants were negotiated with
the Group’s banks, replacing the pre-existing covenants (see Notes 6.2).

As part of its Revolving Credit Facility, the Group is bound by two new covenants calculated
based on the consolidated accounts: Leverage ratio (Consolidated Total Net Debt / Consolidated
proforma EBITDA) and Percentage Test (contribution of the loan guarantors to consolidated
EBITDA and consolidated assets).

#### 6.23 Employee benefits

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each
plan by estimating the amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for services
provided in the current and prior periods, less any unrecognised past service costs and the fair
value of plan assets.

The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds with similar
maturities to the Group’s obligations denominated in the currency in which the benefits are
expected to be paid.

In accordance with Revised IAS 19—Employee Benefits, pensions and other post employment
benefits are measured by a qualified independent actuary using the projected unit credit
method.

Each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is
measured separately to build up the final obligation. The final obligation is then discounted to
present value. These calculations require the use of:

- projected retirement dates;

- a discount rate;

- an inflation rate;

- assumptions regarding future salary increases and staff turnover.

At each closing, the Group determine its discount rate on the basis of the most representative
yield on first class bonds with a duration equivalent to that of its commitments.

The assumptions of salary increase rates correspond to inflation assumptions and forecasts of
individual salary increases. In France, the assumption is an increase of inflation plus an individual
increase as the age of the employee.

The assumptions of mortality, staff turnover and retirement age at retirement are set identically
on all Group entity.

F-96


-----

Obligations are measured annually for the Group’s main plans and once every three years for
other plans unless changes in assumptions or significant changes in demographic data warrant
more frequent measurement.

For each defined benefit plan, the Group recognises a provision equal to the benefit obligation,
less the fair value of plan assets, actuarial gains and losses and any unrecognised past service cost.

Actuarial gains and losses arise on change in assumptions or differences between forecast and
actual data concerning the benefit obligation or the performance of plan assets.

The Group recognises deferred cumulative actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits in
equity and they are presented in “Other comprehensive income”.

- Other long-term employee benefits

The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than pension plans is
equal to the amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for services provided in the
current and prior periods. Other employee benefits mainly comprise seniority bonuses.

Actuarial gains/losses as well as the past services costs related to the long-term employee benefits
other than pensions are recognized immediately in the Profit and Loss.

- Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are
expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to
be paid in short-term cash bonuses or incentive-based profit-sharing plans if the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation to pay the amount as a result of past service provided by
the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

In certain countries excluding France, Group employees are entitled to supplementary pension
plans into which the Group pays annual contributions, and lump sum retirement indemnities paid
out once the employees retire. These take the form of either defined contribution or defined
benefit plans.

Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make
further contributions and the corresponding expense is recognised in profit or loss for the period.
All defined benefit plans concern France.

**Income (Expense) recognised in profit or loss . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(550)** **(88)**

This impact is recognised in full in profit or loss from recurring operations under “Personnel
expenses”.

Revised IAS 19 has had a minimal impact on the measurement of the Group’s employee benefit
obligations for 2015.

The only impact relates to financial income generated on plan assets (these assets concern
approximately 10% of the lump sum retirement indemnity benefit obligation) which is identical
to the rate used to discount liabilities, i.e, yield equivalent to the discount rate.

**6.23.2** **Actuarial assumptions**

All of the Group’s various employee benefit obligations are regularly reviewed by actuaries in
accordance with IFRS standards using the projected unit credit method based on salaries at
retirement.

All actuarial gains and losses and adjustments relating to the limitation are recognised in the
reporting period in which they occur in accordance with Revised IAS 19.

Actuarial assumptions (i.e., the probability that active employees will continue to work in the
Group, mortality rates, retirement age, assumptions regarding future salary increases, etc.)
depend on the demographic and economic conditions in the countries in which the different
plans have been set up.

Discount rates used to determine the present value of benefit obligations are based either on the
government bond rate or on the yield on investment grade corporate bonds that are traded in
an active market with maturities that match the duration of the benefit obligation. In the
eurozone, discount rates have been calculated on software developed by independent actuaries.

Assumptions used in calculating the provision for retirement and similar benefits have only to do
with France and the group decided to change the assumptions compared to December 2014
following the integration of Novescia network for harmonization.

#### 6.24 Provisions

In accordance with IAS 37—Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, a provision is
recognized when, at the reporting date, the Group has an obligation to a third party, and it is
likely or certain that an outflow of resources to this third party without equivalent consideration
of such third parties.

The Group does not provide details of these provisions, considering that the disclosure of the
amount of the provision for litigation is such as to cause the Group serious prejudice.

Some litigation has not been provisioned because the Group considers that the risk is not proven
in support of its legal and tax advice.

Other non-current liabilities include the non-current portion of the capital gain generated in
2006 from refinancing a property finance lease. This internal capital gain was reversed and
deferred over the new lease term and the non-current portion of the deferred income was
recognised in non-current liabilities in accordance with IAS 1.

The other current include interest rate swaps contracted by the Group to hedge its interest rate
risk exposure. They are not eligible for hedge accounting under IAS 39 and consequently, any fair
value adjustments are recognised in profit or loss (see Note 6.10).

#### Additional informations

 6.28 Financial instruments

**6.28.1 Financial risk management**
**_6.28.1.1 Introduction_**
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising on its financial instruments:

- Credit risk

- Liquidity risk

- Market risk

This note presents information on the Group’s exposure to each of the above-mentioned risks,
and its objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk, and capital
management.

**_6.28.1.2 Risk management framework_**

The Supervisory Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the
Group’s risk management framework.

The Group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the
Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to
predetermined limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect
changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and
management standards and procedures, aims to develop a rigorous and effective control
environment in which all employees understand their roles and responsibilities.

The Audit Committee oversees implementation of Group risk management policies and
procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks
faced by the Group.

**6.28.2 Credit risk**

Credit risk is managed at Group level. It is the risk of financial loss for the Group if a client or
counterparty should fail to meet its contractual payment obligations.

Credit risk concerns cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with
banks and financial institutions, as well as exposure to customer credit risk on outstanding
receivables.

In the specialised clinical pathology business, the collection of receivables from direct patients,
which are more than 35 days overdue, is handled by a debt collection company acting solely as a
collection agent on behalf of Cerba. Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the
basis of historical data.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit
management processes.

The trade receivables are therefore retained in the financial statements and stand at € 60 million
at 31 December 2015.

The carrying amount of loans and receivables represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at
the reporting date.

**_6.28.2.1 Trade and other receivables_**

The Group believes that it is neither exposed to material credit risk nor to over dependence on a
specific customer due to its broad customer base, with customers located mainly in Europe.

**_6.28.2.2 Impairment losses_**

Cumulative impairment of trade and other receivables increase to € 7.413 million versus
€ 3.095 million in 2014. Provisions for impairment are mainly related to Novescia Entities.

**6.28.3 Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk of the Group encountering difficulties in meeting the obligations
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash or other financial assets. The
Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it always has

sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and “challenging”
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or damaging the Group’s reputation.

**6.28.4 Market risk**
Market risk includes the risk of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest
rates and equity instrument prices affecting the Group’s profit or the value of its financial
instruments. The objective of market risk management is to contain market risk exposures within
acceptable thresholds, while optimising returns.

**_6.28.4.1 Currency risk_**
The Group’s financial performance is not materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations since
a significant portion of operations takes place within the eurozone and income and expenses are
generally denominated in the similar currency.

ZAR . . . Rand 16.9530 14.1528 14.4065 14.0353

**_6.28.4.2 Interest Rate risk_**
The Group’s financing has been contracted at fixed rates and notably the high-yield bond issue of
31 January 2013, the Additionnal High-yield bond of May 2014 and Senior Secure note on 28[th]

February 2015.

Therefore, the Group is less exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its floating interest rate bank
loans than in previous years.

The Group contracts interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate risk. Only Laboratoire
Cerba is still concerned as Cerba HealthCare unwound its positions following refinancing of the
Group’s debt in early 2013.

At 31 December 2015, the Group had hedged a €13 million property lease with pay-fixed interest
rate swaps.

The carrying amount of the derivative financial instruments used to hedge interest rate risk is
presented below:

**Termination** **Notional** **31 December 2015** **31 December 2014**

**(In thousands of euro)** **date** **principal** **Fair value** **Fair value**

**Pay fixed-rate swap**

**Total pay fixed-rate swap . . . . . . . .** **12,963** **(682)** **(908)**

**Total derivative instruments . . . . . .** **(682)** **(908)**

These interest rate swaps are economic hedges of interest rate risk on loans and borrowings; they
have not been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

**6.28.5 Capital management**

The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base to ensure the Group’s independence and
support future development of the business. Capital consists of ordinary shares, non-redeemable
preference shares and retained earnings. The Supervisory Board monitors the return on equity.

The fair value of trade receivables and trade payables is the amount reported in the statement of
financial position, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The same applies to
other receivables and payables.

The fair value of swaps corresponds to their valuation by their issuing bank. Financial liabilities
are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s bank loans are
contracted at variable rates based on Euribor and their fair value is deemed to correspond to
their value at the closing date.

**_6.28.6.2 Fair value hierarchy_**

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels have been defined as follows:

- Level 1: fair value is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities.

- Level 2: fair value is measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e.
inferred from observable prices).

- Level 3: fair value is measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Operating leases are entered into at market rates and accounted for as operating leases.

The Group uses operating leases for industrial equipment (mainly vehicles and transport
equipment) when there is no economic justification for acquiring the assets in question.

The Group has no contingent lease commitments or sub-letting agreements.

**Cerba HealthCare (ex Cerba European Lab)**

To the President,

In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Cerba HealthCare (ex Cerba European Lab) and in
compliance with your request, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial
statements of Cerba HealthCare (ex Cerba European Lab) for the year ended December 31, 2014
(“the consolidated financial Statements”).

The President is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the
professional guidance issued by the French Institute of statutory auditors (Compagnie nationale
des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing
procedures, on a test basis or by selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by management, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
position and assets and liabilities of the group constituted by the persons or entities included in
the consolidation as of December 31, 2014, and of the results of its operations for the year then
ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the
European Union.

This report is governed by French law. French courts have exclusive jurisdiction to judge any
dispute, claim or disagreement that may result from our letter of engagement or this report or
any related question. Each party irrevocably renounces his or her rights to oppose legal action
brought before these courts, to contend that the action was brought before a court that was not
competent, or that these courts do not have jurisdiction.

The Group is currently analysing the impact on its consolidated financial statements of the
standards published by the IASB at 31 December 2014 but not yet adopted by the EU but it does
not expect the impact to be material.

**6.3.2 Comparability of financial statements**

The accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements at 31 December
2014 are identical to those used for the consolidated statements at 31 December 2013.

As part of a consolidated reporting optimization process, some items were reclassified in 2014
and refining in terms of accounting position in the income statement.

These changes include the lines “Consumption of materials and supplies” and “Other purchases
and external expenses” but have no major effect on the aggregates of our financial statements.

**6.3.3 Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost principle,
except for derivative instruments, which are measured at fair value.

Concerning the business combinations (See Note 6.4.1.1), the Group acquires control of an entity
or group of entities, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized and
measured at fair value. The difference between the consideration transferred (i.e. the acquisition
cost) and the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, net of the liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill.

Goodwill is recorded directly in the statement of financial position of the acquired entity, in the
entity’s functional currency.

Its recoverable amount is subsequently monitored at the level of the cash-generating unit to
which the entity belongs.

**6.3.4 Functional and presentation currency**

The consolidated financial statements are presented in Thousands of Euros, the Company’s
functional currency, and rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise specified.

**6.3.5 Use of estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the
reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual amounts may differ from
these estimates.

Management bases these estimates and assumptions on past experience and the Group’s current
business environment and they are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The impacts of changes to
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and for all future
periods affected.

Estimates and assumptions are particularly important for measuring:

- the recoverable amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, especially
goodwill presented in notes 6.11, 6.12 and 6.13;

- obligations under defined benefit plans ;

- deferred tax assets and liabilities.

**6.4 Significant accounting policies**

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in
the consolidated financial statements and by all Group entities.

F-123


-----

**6.4.1 Basis of consolidation**
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements include those of the parent company and
all of its subsidiaries for the period ended 31 December 2014. All of the subsidiaries close their
accounts on 31 December, except for LBS (30 September) and CRI (30 November).

The Group consolidates all entities over which it exercises exclusive control – either directly or
indirectly – using the full consolidation method. Entities over which the Group has significant
influence are accounted for using the equity method without applying any threshold in terms of
its interest and/or voting rights.

All material intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses are totally eliminated.

All profits and losses generated by subsidiaries are broken out into the portion attributable to
owners of the Company and to non-controlling interests, based on their respective interests.

**_6.4.1.1 Business combinations_**
In accordance with Revised IFRS 3, business combinations acquired after to 1 January 2010 are
accounted for using the purchase method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which
control was transferred to the Group.

The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

- the fair value of the consideration transferred; (+)

- the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; (+)

- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity
interest in the acquiree; (-)

- the net recognised amount (in general the fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed.

Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is subsequently
adjusted through goodwill only when additional information is obtained after the acquisition
date about facts and circumstances that existed at that date.

Such adjustments are made only during the 12-month measurement period that follows the
acquisition date.

All other subsequent adjustments are recorded as a receivable or payable through profit or loss.

In the case of multi-step acquisitions, acquisition of control over the acquiree triggers
remeasurement of all previously-held equity interests at fair value and any material changes are
recognised in profit or loss from recurring operations.

Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the
Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Contingent consideration is recognised in equity if the contingent payment is settled by delivery
of a fixed number of the acquirer’s equity instruments; in all other cases, it is recognised in
liabilities related to business combinations. Contingent consideration is recognised at fair value
at the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. If the contingent consideration
was originally recognised as a liability, any subsequent adjustments are recognised in profit or
loss unless such adjustments are made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are related
to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Purchased goodwill is accounted for as
a business combination.

**_6.4.1.2 Acquisitions of non-controlling interests_**
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their
capacity as owners. Therefore, no goodwill is recognised. Adjustments to non-controlling

F-124


-----

interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are determined based
on the proportionate interest in the net assets of the subsidiary.

Operations that do not lead to a loss of control are treated as transactions between shareholders,
giving rise to a new split between equity attributable to owners of the Company and to
non-controlling interests. The same allocation basis is applied to any transaction costs.

**_6.4.1.3 Subsidiaries_**
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. An investor controls an investee when it is
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

French legislation requires laboratories to be incorporated as private practice companies (Société
_d’Exercice Libéral – SEL) and the clinical pathologists operating the private practice companies to_
hold at least 50% of the voting rights at shareholders’ annual general meetings. In strict
compliance with these regulations, the Group has created a capital structure to meet these
obligations and hold the majority of the related financial interests (see Note 6.5). Moreover,
specific clauses, especially concerning the governance structure, are included in the articles of
association and shareholders agreements.

Although the Group does not hold the majority of voting rights in the private practice
companies, the above-mentioned mechanisms allow it to obtain the majority of the economic
benefits derived from the activities of these companies and also to demonstrate the existence of
_de facto control in full compliance with French legislation, therefore enabling the French entities_
to be fully consolidated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that
control ceases (see Note 6.4.1.4). Divestment resulting in loss of control

**_6.4.1.4 Disvestment resulting in loss of control_**
Upon loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any
non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any
profit or loss arising on the loss of control is recognised in “Profit or loss from recurring
operations”.

If the Group retains any interest in its former subsidiary, said interest is measured at fair value at
the date that control is relinquished. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted
investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset, depending on the level of influence retained.

**_6.4.1.5 Transactions eliminated in consolidation_**
Intra-group balances and transactions and any income and expenses arising from intra-group
transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

**_6.4.1.6 Foreign currency transactions_**
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies of
the respective Group entities at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the
functional currency at the closing exchange rate.

Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in profit or loss.

**_6.4.1.7 Foreign operations_**
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations – including goodwill and fair value adjustments
arising on acquisitions – whose functional currency is not the euro, are translated into euros at
the closing exchange rate, and their statements of comprehensive income are translated into
euros using average exchange rates for the period.

F-125


-----

The foreign currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are
recognised in “Other comprehensive income”. They are carried in the foreign currency
translation reserve in consolidated equity until the related investments are sold or wound up.

**6.4.2 Financial instruments**

**_6.4.2.1 Definitions_**
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are presented in accordance with IAS 39.

They are broken out into their current and non-current portion, depending on whether they
mature in under or over one year.

In accordance with IAS 39, the obligating event is recognition in the balance sheet at the
transaction date: if there is a time-lag between the transaction date (i.e., the obligation) and the
settlement date, securities deliverable or receivable are recognised from the transaction date.

**_6.4.2.2 Non-derivative financial assets_**
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date they originated.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in
which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised
as a separate asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and
intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Factoring contract_
Receivables assigned to third parties under factoring agreements are derecognised when
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to these third parties and,
more particularly, when the factoring company bears the risks of non-recoverability and late
payment.

_Loans and receivables_
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly
attributable transaction costs and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less any impairment losses.

Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.

_Cash and cash equivalents_
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash on hand, amounts invested in money
market funds and negotiable debt instruments, readily convertible into known amounts of cash,
and subject to insignificant interest rate risk exposure. They do not include bank overdraft
facilities.

**_6.4.2.3 Non-derivative financial liabilities_**
The Group initially recognises debt securities and subordinated liabilities on the date they
originated.

Financial liabilities consist of borrowings and debt, in accordance with IAS 39.

Loans whose contractual rate of interest is tied to the Group’s business data are deemed to be at
a fixed rate (at the effective interest rate calculated at the inception of the loan).

In the event of a change in the underlying data used to calculate the effective interest rate, the
carrying amount of the loan is adjusted with a matching entry to finance costs.

F-126


-----

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations have been
discharged, cancelled or expired.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities as other financial liabilities. Such financial
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. They
are subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other
payables.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated
statement of cash flows.

**_6.4.2.4 Share capital_**
_Ordinary shares_
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a
deduction from equity, net of any tax effect.

_Preference shares_
Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable, or redeemable at the
Company’s discretion only, and the distribution of any dividends is also discretionary. Dividends
thereon are deducted directly from equity once they have been approved by the Company’s
shareholders at their general meeting.

All of the preference shares issued by the Group meet the definition of equity instruments.

_Share-based payment_
On 21 July 2010, the Company issued shares with warrants to senior executives and some Group
employees.

The issue was recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as a share-based payment and the warrants
were measured at fair value on the grant date.

The fair value of stock options is based on the exercise price and the expected life of the option;
the price of the underlying stock at the grant date; the expected volatility in the share price;
forecast dividends; and the risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.

This method results in a fair value of warrants that is equal to their issue price. The shares with
warrants have therefore been classified as equity at their issue cost. Since the issue price is equal
to the grant-date fair value, the corresponding expense in the income statement is nil.

**_6.4.2.5 Hybrid financial instruments_**
Hybrid financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible bonds denominated in
euros that can be converted into a fixed number of shares.

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of
a similar liability that does not have a conversion option, by discounting the contractual cash
flows at a market rate. The equity component is recognised initially for the amount of the
difference between the proceeds from the issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value of
the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability
and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is subsequently remeasured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a hybrid financial instrument
is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition.

Interest and any gains and losses related to the financial liability are recognised in profit or loss.
Upon conversion of the bonds, the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is
recognised.

F-127


-----

**_6.4.2.6 Derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps)_**

The Group has contracted interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risk exposure. They are
not eligible for hedge accounting under IAS 39 and consequently, any fair value adjustments are
recognised in profit or loss.

**6.4.3 Goodwill and intangible assets**

**_6.4.3.1 Goodwill_**

For initial recognition of goodwill, see Note 6.4.1.1.

_Subsequent measurement_

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs)
or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business
combination.

The CGUs or group of CGUs identified by the Group are as follows:

- Specialised clinical pathology CGU: this activity involves complex clinical testing and/or testing
requiring specific equipment that clients (hospitals, clinics, private or community laboratories)
do not have.

- France private clinical laboratory testing CGU and Belux private clinical laboratory testing CGU.

- Clinical trials CGU: conducting clinical trials (logistics, analyses, results) for pharmaceutical
companies and biotechnology firms during the drug development phase.

Business goodwill acquired during the period is recognised as part of goodwill.

**_6.4.3.2 Research and development_**

Expenditure on research activities to gain new scientific and technical knowledge and
understanding is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Development expenditure is expensed if the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset as
defined by IAS 38, are not met.

Under IAS 38—Intangible Assets, development expenditure must be recognised as an intangible
asset if the entity is able to demonstrate:

- its intention and its financial and technical ability to complete the development project;

- that it is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the development
expenditure will flow to the entity; and

- that the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Gross capitalised development expenditure also includes borrowing costs.

**_6.4.3.3 Intangible assets_**

The intangible assets acquired by the Group that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

They include customer contractual relationships and order books acquired in business
combinations.

**_6.4.3.4 Subsequent expenditure_**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure
on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

F-128


-----

**_6.4.3.5 Amortisation_**
Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives from the date that they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

- [Patents and trademarks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years]

- [Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1-3 years]

- [Contractual customer relationships (specialised clinical pathology CGU) . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 years]

- [Order books (clinical trials CGU) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 years]

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted where appropriate.

**6.4.4 Property, plant and equipment**
**_6.4.4.1 Recognition and measurement_**
In accordance with IAS 16, the gross carrying amount of an item of property, plant and
equipment corresponds to its acquisition or production cost and it is not revalued.

Capital expenditure grants are recognised as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the
asset for which they were granted.

Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When
components of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for
as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the
difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is
recognised in profit or loss.

Leases are dealt with in Note 6.4.5.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is dealt with in Note 6.4.4.3 below.

**_6.4.4.2 Subsequent costs_**
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits
associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. Repairs and maintenance are expensed
as incurred.

**_6.4.4.3 Depreciation_**
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each component. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain
ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and
ready for use or, in the case of self-constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed
and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

- [Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 years]

- [Plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5-10 years]

- [Fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5-10 years]

- [Equipment and tooling . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years]

- [Transport equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4-5 years]

- [Office and IT equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-5 years]

- [Furniture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5-10 years]

F-129


-----

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted where appropriate.

**6.4.5 Leased assets**

Assets under finance leases or arrangements that are in substance finance leases as defined by
IAS 17—Leases and IFRIC 4, respectively, are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet.

Leases under whose substance or form the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is
measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the
minimum lease payments.

After the initial accounting, the asset is subsequently accounted for in accordance with the
accounting policy applicable to this type of asset.

Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance
expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each
period over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability.

Other leases are operating leases and are not recognised as non-current assets.

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the
total lease expense, and as a reduction in rental expense over the term of the lease.

**6.4.6 Inventories**

Finished goods inventories, mainly comprising reagents and consumables, are recognised at
purchase cost, plus any directly attributable costs. They are measured on a VAT-inclusive basis less
the applicable pro rata VAT amounts.

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is
based on the first-in first-out method.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

**6.4.7 Impairment**

**_6.4.7.1 Non-derivative financial assets_**
A financial asset not classified as at fair value is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it may be impaired as a result of one or more events
that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset giving rise to a loss event with an impact
on the estimated future cash flows of the asset that can be estimated reliably.

_Financial assets measured at amortised cost_

The Group considers evidence of impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost (loans
and receivables) both individually and collectively.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit
management processes. Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the basis of
historical data but provisions for doubtful debts are booked on a case by case basis. In the
specialised clinical pathology business, receivables from direct patients which are more than 35
days overdue are handled by a debt collection company.

In assessing collective impairment of receivables, the Group uses historical trends of the
probability of default, payment patterns and the amount of losses incurred in the past, adjusted
based on management’s assessment of whether current economic and credit conditions are such
that actual losses are likely to be greater or less than those suggested by historical trends.

F-130


-----

An impairment loss on a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference
between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss under “Net change in amortisation and
impairment” with a matching entry in an allowance account for loans and receivables. Any
subsequent decrease in the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

**_6.4.7.2 Non-financial assets_**
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred
tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is
recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Assets are grouped together into the
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. For the purposes of goodwill
impairment testing, the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the
level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is
monitored for internal reporting purposes. CGUs are aggregated within operating segments.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to
benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Goodwill impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in
respect of CGUs are first allocated against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the
CGU (or group of CGUs), and then against the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU
(or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. For other assets, an impairment
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

**6.4.8 Employee benefits**
In accordance with the laws and practices of the countries in which it operates, the Group grants
its employees post-employment benefits (pension plans) and other long-term benefits (longservice bonuses).

In addition to regulatory post-employment benefits in the countries in which the Group is
present, Group employees are also entitled to supplementary pension plans and lump sum
retirement indemnities (see Note 6.23).

These take the form of either defined contribution or defined benefit plans indemnities (see
Note 6.23).

Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make
further contributions and the corresponding expense is recognised in profit or loss for the period.

**_6.4.8.1 Defined benefit plans_**
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each
plan by estimating the amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for services
provided in the current and prior periods, less any unrecognised past service costs and the fair
value of plan assets. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds
with similar maturities to the Group’s obligations denominated in the currency in which the
benefits are expected to be paid.

F-131


-----

In accordance with Revised IAS 19 – Employee Benefits, pensions and other post employment
benefits are measured by a qualified independent actuary using the projected unit credit
method: each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each
unit is measured separately to build up the final obligation. The final obligation is then
discounted to present value. These calculations require the use of:

- projected retirement dates;

- a discount rate;

- an inflation rate;

- assumptions regarding future salary increases and staff turnover.

Obligations are measured annually for the Group’s main plans and once every three years for
other plans unless changes in assumptions or significant changes in demographic data warrant
more frequent measurement.

For each defined benefit plan, the Group recognises a provision equal to the benefit obligation,
less the fair value of plan assets, actuarial gains and losses and any unrecognised past service cost.

Actuarial gains and losses arise on change in assumptions or differences between forecast and
actual data concerning the benefit obligation or the performance of plan assets.

The Group recognises deferred cumulative actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits in
equity and they are presented in “Other comprehensive income”.

**_6.4.8.2 Other long-term employee benefits_**
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than pension plans is
equal to the amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for services provided in the
current and prior periods. Other employee benefits mainly comprise seniority bonuses.

Actuarial gains/losses as well as the past services costs related to the long-term employee benefits
other than pensions are recognized immediately in the Profit and Loss.

**_6.4.8.3 Short-term employee benefits_**
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are
expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to
be paid in short-term cash bonuses or incentive-based profit-sharing plans if the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation to pay the amount as a result of past service provided by
the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**6.4.9 Provisions**
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of
the discount is recognised under finance costs.

**_6.4.9.1 Restructuring provisions_**
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal
restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provisioned.

**6.4.10 Net sales**
Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value
of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual
volume discounts for hospitals after the elimination of intra-group sales.

F-132


-----

Specialised clinical pathology and private clinical testing operations are carried out in clinical
laboratories. Revenue related to analyses/tests carried out is recognised when the report is
validated by the clinical pathologist (on the date results are given to the client).

Clinical trials are governed by contractual agreements providing for specific invoicing
arrangements at each stage. Revenue is recognised using the percentage-of-completion method.
Percentage of completion is measured on the basis of work performed.

**6.4.11 Other income and expenses**
Other income and other expenses include both recurring and non-recurring income and
expenses. Non-recurring items comprise extraordinary income and expenses, which due to their
nature, amount or frequency generally correspond to major one-off or unusual events.

**6.4.12 Financial income and finance costs**
Net finance costs comprise:

- interest expense relating to financial debt;

- gains and losses on interest rate derivatives (rate swaps) used to hedge interest rate risk on the
Group’s debt;

- income from cash and cash equivalents, which comprises interest paid on cash investments and
cash equivalents.

Other financial income and expense mainly comprise foreign exchange gains and losses and
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

**6.4.13 Income tax**
Income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax recognised in accordance with IAS 12. Current
tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit and loss unless they relate to a business
combination, or to items that are recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable profit or tax loss for the period,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts and tax base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is
not a business combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit;

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures insofar as it is
probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates (and laws) that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the year-end and are expected to apply when the asset is
realised or the liability is settled.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Company takes into account the
impact of any uncertain tax positions and any additional taxes and interest that may be due.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax assets and liabilities and they relate to taxes levied by the same authority, either on the same
taxable entity or on different tax entities that intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on
a net basis, and realise their tax assets and settle their tax liabilities simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is only recognised for unused tax credits, tax losses and deductible
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available

F-133

against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and
reduced if it is no longer probable that taxable profit will be available against which they can be
used.

The €94,5 million increase in the gross value of goodwill relates to goodwill on acquisitions of
securities and companies during the period (see Note 6.2).

The tests are performed at the level of cash generating unit (CGU) to which the assets belong.
CGUs are defined as the smallest identifiable Group of assets that generates cash inflows that are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

If a CGU’s recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised
in profit or loss and, to the extent possible, as an adjustment to the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the CGU.

The Goodwill broken down by CGU is as follows:

**Carrying amount at** **Acquisitions or** **Acquisitions of** **Net book value at**
**(In millions of euro)** **31 December 2013** **securities** **businesses Impairment** **31 December 2014**

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . .** **599,3** **94,5** **—** **(22,6)** **671.3**

In accordance with IAS 36, and considering the goodwill was tested for impairment at
31 December 2014, the Group identified impairment on the CGU “Clinical Trial”. The impairment

tests were based on the value in use of each CGU calculated using the discounted cash flow
method as described in Note 6.4.3.1 of the accounting policies section.

The main assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of the CGUs as of 31 December
2014 were the following:

**2014.12**

**Cash flow projection** **Long-term growth**
**Cash generating units** **period** **Discount rate** **rate**

Specialised clinical pathology CGU . . . . . . . 6 years 7.10% 2.00%

**2013.12**

**Cash flow projection** **Long-term growth**
**Cash generating units** **period** **Discount rate** **rate**

Specialised clinical pathology CGU . . . . . . . 6 years 8.20% 2.00%
France clinical laboratory testing CGU . . . . 6 years 8.20% 2.50%
Belux clinical laboratory testing CGU . . . . . 6 years 8.20% 2.50%
Clinical trial CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 years 8.90% 3.50%

Cash flows were discounted based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated on
the basis of the expected return and market risk for each CGU.

Impairment testing was carried out using the same procedures as in previous periods: key
modelling assumptions such as market multiples and the discount rate reflected stock market and
macro-economic trends.The resulting multiples are close to those of companies engaged in
businesses that are similar to those of the Cerba Group.

The terminal value is calculated by discounting cash flows to long term, based on normalised cash
flows and a perpetuity growth rate, taking into account of market development potential and
competitive position. The discounted cash flows are compared to the sum of the goodwill and
the operating assets allocated to the CGU (intangible assets, items of property, plant and
equipment and components of working capital, net of deferred tax liabilities).

Testing and the cash flow calculation were based on the most recent medium-term plan (MTP),
covering the years 2015-2020 validated by management based on markets conditions at
December 2014.

The growth rates used to estimate the cash flows of the CGUs or Groups of CGUs are considerably
less than the Group’s average historical growth rates.

At 31 December 2014, an impairment loss of €22.6 million was recognised on the specialised
clinical pathology CGU following impairment testing after having lowered the performance
objectives of the business plan on this activity in addition to the impairment recorded at 30 June
2012 of €48.5 million on the CGU “Specialised Clinical pathology”. On the others CGU’s, no
evidence of impairment has been identified.

The weighted average cost of capital and market multiples are adjusted based on business data
and the geographical location of the CGUs tested.

At 31 December 2014, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs or Groups of CGUs were higher than
their carrying amounts except on the CGU “Clinical Trial”(cf Supra)

Sensitivity analyses have been performed on all of the CGUs and the results of testing the value
in use (of the groups of assets to which most goodwill is allocated) against changes in the various
assumptions used at 31 December 2014 are shown in the following table:

**Discount rate for cash** **Growth rate to** **Combination of**
**(In millions of euro)** **Test margin** **flows 0.5%** **infinity -0.5%** **two factors**

Specialised clinical pathology
CGU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 161.7 (33.1) (26.7) (55.0)

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **368.8** **(105.3)** **(85.1)** **(175.0)**

A decline in value in use following the application of the sensitivities indicated below either
separately or based on a combination of the two factors does not actually undermine the
carrying amount of goodwill.

Only the clinical trials CGU would be exposed to a slight risk of impairment in the unlikely event
of a simultaneous change in the two factors indicated

**6.21.2 Ordinary shares**
Each ordinary share carries one voting right at the general meetings of shareholders. Each share
entitles its owner to receive a share in the Company’s profits, assets, reserves, distributions or
liquidation surplus.

**6.21.3 Warrants**
On 21 July 2010, Cerba HealthCare issued 16 million shares with warrants for an aggregate
nominal value of €160,000. The share premium amounted to €15.84 million and the warrants to
€0.79 million.

Each share has two warrants attached: warrant 1 valued at €0.015625 and warrant 2 at €0.03375.

Shares with warrants are reserved for senior executives and some Group company managers,
designated by the Commitments Board. The shares with warrants were issued at fair value as
determined by an expert.

They were measured at the grant-date fair value, which corresponds to their issue price.
Consequently, no expense was recognised under IFRS 2

Group policy consists of spreading the maturities of its long-term debt (bonds, private
placements and bank borrowings) over time in order to limit annual refinancing requirements.

Financing arrangements set up when the Group was created were as follows:

- Convertible and non-convertible bonds, most of which bear interest at 10%, maturing on
21 July 2025. The Interests are capitalised annually. The majority of convertible bonds were
converted into shares following the decision of the General Shareholders’ Meeting of
11 December 2012 to increase the share capital of the holding company.

- Existing loans at 31 January 2012 were refinanced by the high-yield bonds issued on 31 January
2013 and by the additional draw (see Note 6.2).

- The Group has also received financing from its shareholders in the form of non-convertible
bonds.

The Group’s subsidiaries have local medium-term credit facilities.

**6.22.2 Debts covenants**
The main financial liabilities are subject to certain conditions applied to the consolidated
financial statements and notably the ratio of net debt to gross operating profit (or EBITDA).

Following the refinancing operation of January 2013, new debt covenants were negotiated with
the Group’s banks, replacing the pre-existing covenants (see Notes 6.2).

As part of its Revolving Credit Facility, the Group is bound by two new covenants calculated
based on the consolidated accounts: Leverage ratio (Consolidated Total Net Debt / Consolidated
proforma EBITDA) and Percentage Test (contribution of the loan guarantors to consolidated
EBITDA and consolidated assets).

In certain countries, Group employees are entitled to supplementary pension plans into which
the Group pays annual contributions, and lump sum retirement indemnities paid out once the
employees retire. These take the form of either defined contribution or defined benefit plans.

Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make
further contributions and the corresponding expense is recognised in profit or loss for the period.
All defined benefit plans concern France.

**6.23.1 Change in the present value of the net defined benefit obligation**
Changes in the Group’s net defined benefit obligation break down as follows, taking into

Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make

Assumptions used in calculating the provision for retirement and similar benefits have only to do
with France and are the same as December 2014.

**Income (Expense) recognised in profit or loss . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(88)** **(163)**

This impact is recognised in full in profit or loss from recurring operations under “Personnel
expenses”.

Revised IAS 19 has had a minimal impact on the measurement of the Group’s employee benefit
obligations for 2014.

The only impact relates to financial income generated on plan assets (these assets concern
approximately 10% of the lump sum retirement indemnity benefit obligation) which is identical
to the rate used to discount liabilities, i.e., yield equivalent to the discount rate.

**6.23.2 Actuarial assumptions**
All of the Group’s various employee benefit obligations are regularly reviewed by actuaries in
accordance with IFRS standards using the projected unit credit method based on salaries at
retirement.

All actuarial gains and losses and adjustments relating to the limitation are recognised in the
reporting period in which they occur in accordance with Revised IAS 19.

Actuarial assumptions (i.e., the probability that active employees will continue to work in the
Group, mortality rates, retirement age, assumptions regarding future salary increases, etc.)
depend on the demographic and economic conditions in the countries in which the different
plans have been set up.

Discount rates used to determine the present value of benefit obligations are based either on the
government bond rate or on the yield on investment grade corporate bonds that are traded in
an active market with maturities that match the duration of the benefit obligation. In the
eurozone, discount rates have been calculated on software developed by independent actuaries.

The Group does not provide details of these provisions, considering that the disclosure of the
amount of the provision for litigation is such as to cause the Group serious prejudice.

Some litigation has not been provisioned because the Group considers that the risk is not proven
in support of its legal and tax advice.

Other non-current liabilities include the non-current portion of the capital gain generated in
2006 from refinancing a property finance lease. This internal capital gain was reversed and
deferred over the new lease term and the non-current portion of the deferred income was
recognised in non-current liabilities in accordance with IAS 1.

#### Additional informations

 6.28 Financial instruments

**6.28.1 Financial risk management**
**_6.28.1.1 Introduction_**
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising on its financial instruments:

- Credit risk

- Liquidity risk

- Market risk

This note presents information on the Group’s exposure to each of the above-mentioned risks,
and its objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk, and capital
management.

**_6.28.1.2 Risk management framework_**
The Supervisory Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the
Group’s risk management framework.

The Group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the
Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to
predetermined limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect
changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and
management standards and procedures, aims to develop a rigorous and effective control
environment in which all employees understand their roles and responsibilities.

The Audit Committee oversees implementation of Group risk management policies and
procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks
faced by the Group.

**6.28.2 Credit risk**
Credit risk is managed at Group level. It is the risk of financial loss for the Group if a client or
counterparty should fail to meet its contractual payment obligations.

Credit risk concerns cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with
banks and financial institutions, as well as exposure to customer credit risk on outstanding
receivables.

In the specialised clinical pathology business, the collection of receivables from direct patients,
which are more than 35 days overdue, is handled by a debt collection company acting solely as a
collection agent on behalf of Cerba. Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the
basis of historical data.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit
management processes.

The Group entered into a factoring arrangement in February 2012 but this contract had not been
fully used at year-end. Its contractual conditions do not make it possible to conclude that the
main risks and rewards related to the assigned receivables have actually been transferred to the
factor as the related credit risk is not transferred. The trade receivables are therefore retained in
the financial statements and stand at €45 million at 31 December 2014.

The carrying amount of loans and receivables represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at
the reporting date.

**_6.28.2.1 Trade and other receivables_**
The Group believes that it is neither exposed to material credit risk nor to over dependence on a
specific customer due to its broad customer base, with customers located mainly in Europe.

F-154


-----

**_6.28.2.2 Impairment losses_**
Cumulative impairment of trade and other receivables dropped 13% year on year to
€3.095 million (2013: €1.174 million). Provisions for impairment are mainly related to Cerba’s
operations.

**6.28.3 Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk of the Group encountering difficulties in meeting the obligations
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash or other financial assets. The
Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it always has
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and “challenging”
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or damaging the Group’s reputation.

**6.28.4 Market risk**

Market risk includes the risk of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest
rates and equity instrument prices affecting the Group’s profit or the value of its financial
instruments. The objective of market risk management is to contain market risk exposures within
acceptable thresholds, while optimising returns.

F-155


-----

**_6.28.4.1 Currency risk_**
The Group’s financial performance is not materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations since
a significant portion of operations takes place within the eurozone and income and expenses are
generally denominated in the similar currency.

The following exchange rates were used during the period for the main currencies:

**2014** **2013**
**Exchange rate at** **Average rate at** **Exchange rate at** **Average rate at**
**31 December** **31 December** **31 December** **31 December**

AUD Australian Dollar . . . . 1,4829 1,4724 1,5423 1,3770

ZAR Rand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14,0353 14,4065 14,5660 12,8308

**_6.28.4.2 Interest Rate risk_**
The Group’s financing has been contracted at fixed rates and notably the high-yield bond issue of
31 January 2013 and the Senior Secure note of May 2014.

Therefore, the Group is less exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its floating interest rate bank
loans than in previous years.

The Group contracts interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate risk. Only Laboratoire
Cerba is still concerned as Cerba HealthCare unwound its positions following refinancing of the
Group’s debt in early 2013.

At 31 December 2014, the Group had hedged a €13 million property lease with pay-fixed interest
rate swaps.

The carrying amount of the derivative financial instruments used to hedge interest rate risk is
presented below:

**31 December 2014** **31 December 2013**

**Notional**
**(In thousands of euro)** **Termination date** **principal** **Fair value** **Fair value**

**Pay fixed-rate swap**
3-month Euribor—4.16% . . . . . 11/01/2019 10,886 (763) (821)
3-month Euribor—2.195% . . . . 27/07/2023 2,077 (145) (77)

**Total pay fixed-rate swap . . . .** **12,963** **(908)** **(898)**

**Total derivative instruments . .** **(908)** **(898)**

These interest rate swaps are economic hedges of interest rate risk on loans and borrowings; they
have not been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

**6.28.5 Capital management**
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base to ensure the Group’s independence and
support future development of the business. Capital consists of ordinary shares, non-redeemable
preference shares and retained earnings. The Supervisory Board monitors the return on equity.

**Financial liabilities . . . .** **908** **640,328** **641,236** **898** **525,700** **526,598**

The fair value of trade receivables and trade payables is the amount reported in the statement of
financial position, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The same applies to
other receivables and payables.

The fair value of swaps corresponds to their valuation by their issuing bank. Financial liabilities
are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s bank loans are
contracted at variable rates based on Euribor and their fair value is deemed to correspond to
their value at the closing date.

**_6.28.6.2 Fair value hierarchy_**
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels have been defined as follows:

- Level 1: fair value is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities.

- Level 2: fair value is measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e.
inferred from observable prices).

F-157


-----

- Level 3: fair value is measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Operating leases are entered into at market rates and accounted for as operating leases (see
Note 6.4.5).

The Group uses operating leases for industrial equipment (mainly vehicles and transport
equipment) when there is no economic justification for acquiring the assets in question.

The Group has no contingent lease commitments or sub-letting agreements.

**1.7 Creditor Rights prior to relevant Debt Issuance**

To the extent that this Agreement grants rights for the benefit of any Secured Party, or
Unsecured Creditor, no such rights shall accrue or be enforceable against any other party prior to

A-60


-----

the incurrence of the relevant indebtedness with respect thereto in such capacity and accession
to this Agreement by such party in such capacity.

**1.8 Holding Company Debt**

Notwithstanding any term of this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall (a) regulate,
restrict or prohibit a Topco Independent Obligor from incurring any indebtedness, granting any
Security over its assets (other than assets subject to the Transaction Security) or providing any
guarantees, or (b) require any creditor in respect of such indebtedness to become a party to (or
be bound by) the provisions of this Agreement other than where such creditor is a Secured Party
(in such capacity).

**1.9 Waiver and Termination**

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Debt Document,
any Party may, together with exercising any right pursuant to paragraph (f) of Clause 27.1
(Required Consents), unilaterally waive, relinquish, or otherwise release or decline the right
to receive or benefit from, any right in relation to a Debt Document, including in relation to
Transaction Security or any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of
any Liabilities owed to it by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider with the prior consent
of the Company; and by written notice from the Company to each Agent party to this
Agreement and the Security Agent at such time (a “Unilateral Waiver”).

(b) Following a Unilateral Waiver by a Party in accordance with paragraph (a) above, the
Security Agent shall (i) be deemed to have unilaterally waived, relinquished, or otherwise
released or declined the right to receive or benefit from the same or any substantially
equivalent right to the rights subject to such Unilateral Waiver, in connection with any
Parallel Debt or other parallel debt and/or joint and several creditorship structure relating to
the relevant Liabilities; and (ii) at the request and cost of the Company, take any action or
execute any document reasonably requested by the Company which is necessary or desirable
to give effect to or evidence the releases and other actions described in this Clause 1.9.

(c) Any Unilateral Waiver by a Party in accordance with paragraph (a) above shall also be
deemed to constitute a waiver of the rights of such Party (and the Security Agent, as
relevant) under Clause 16 (Application of Proceeds), Clause 17 (Equalisation) and any other
equalisation or loss sharing provisions under any Debt Document in so far as such provisions
relate to the rights subject to such Unilateral Waiver, including such that to the extent that
the Liabilities of a Creditor would, but for the Unilateral Waiver, have had the benefit of any
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss or Transaction Security under which
Recoveries are received by the Security Agent or other Creditors, that Creditor will not
benefit from the application of, or receive any payments in respect of, such Recoveries
pursuant to Clause 16 (Application of Proceeds) in respect of those Liabilities; and if, as a
result of this paragraph (c), the amount of a payment to a Creditor pursuant to Clause 16
(Application of Proceeds) is lower than the amount which would have been so payable to
that Creditor if no Unilateral Waiver was given (the difference for that Creditor being its
“Shortfall”), for the purposes of Clause 17 (Equalisation) its Senior Secured Exposure, Second
Lien Exposure or Topco Exposure (as applicable) will be deemed to be reduced by an amount
equal to the Shortfall.

(d) To the extent that the consent of any Creditor or other Party (in each case other than the
Company and each Party granting such Unilateral Waiver) would be required to give effect
to any Unilateral Waiver or any other action or matter set out in this Clause 1.9, such
Creditor or other Party shall be deemed to have given such consent.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Debt Document:

(i) no breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking, obligation or other term of (or
Default or Event of Default under) a Debt Document shall be deemed or construed to

A-61


-----

have occurred as a direct or indirect result of a Unilateral Waiver or any actions or steps
implemented or taken to give effect to that Unilateral Waiver; and

(ii) for the purpose of testing or satisfying any requirement (or any qualifier or definition
based upon such a requirement) in any Debt Document that any guarantee, indemnity
or other assurance against loss or any Transaction Security must, to the extent legally
possible or subject to the Agreed Security Principles (or both), be given, or expressed to
be given, to all Secured Parties in respect of their Liabilities, any Liabilities the subject of
a Unilateral Waiver shall be deemed to have been given or expressed to have been given
that guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss or any Transaction Security (as
applicable).

**1.10 No Investor Recourse**

No Secured Creditor will have any recourse to or shall make any claim or demand for payment
from any Investor or any other person that is not party to a Finance Document (and to the extent
an Investor or any other person is a party to a Finance Document there shall only be recourse to
the extent of its liability under the terms of such Finance Document) in respect of any term of
any Finance Document, any statements by Investors, or otherwise.

**1.11 Personal Liability**

Where any natural person gives a certificate or other document or otherwise gives a
representation or statement on behalf of any of the parties to the Debt Documents pursuant to
any provision thereof and such certificate or other document, representation or statement proves
to be incorrect, the individual shall incur no personal liability in consequence of such certificate,
other document, representation or statement being incorrect save where such individual acted
fraudulently in giving such certificate, other document, representation or statement (in which
case any liability of such individual shall be determined in accordance with applicable law) and
each such individual may rely on this Clause subject to Clause 1.3 (Third Party Rights) and the
provisions of the Third Parties Act.

Company shall be entitled to require (subject to receipt of the Required Creditor Consent

written notice to each Agent and each Hedge Counterparty (an “IPO Pushdown Notice”))
that the terms of the Debt Documents shall automatically operate (with effect from the date
specified in the relevant IPO Pushdown Notice (the “IPO Pushdown Date”)) on the basis of
the following principles as the context so determines:

all related provisions) shall continue to comprise the Company and its Subsidiaries
from time to time;

Pushdown Entity;

(iii) each reference in this Agreement or any other Debt Document to the Company or any
Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (including as a Borrower, Guarantor,
Debtor or counterparty to a Hedging Agreement) shall be deemed to be a reference to
the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires
otherwise) and provided that nothing in this paragraph (a), including the deeming
construct contemplated by this paragraph (iii) and any action taken by the IPO
Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Company, shall, or shall be deemed
to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking or other term in the Debt Documents or a Default or an Event of Default;

(iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings or Events of Default in the Debt
Documents shall apply to any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in
its capacity as a Debtor or otherwise);

(vi) each Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from all obligations under the Debt Documents (including any
Transaction Security granted by any such Holding Company or as a Borrower, Guarantor
or Debtor);

(A) each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider, Investor or Topco
Independent Obligor (or in any capacity in referred to in any of the aforementioned
definitions) (each in such capacity, a “Released Person”) shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from this Agreement and all obligations and restrictions
under this Agreement (and from the date specified by the Company that person
shall cease to be Party in the applicable capacity as a Released Person and shall have
no further rights or obligations under this Agreement in that capacity); and

(B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party to this
Agreement as a Released Person,

and provided that the IPO Pushdown Notice confirms that the Board of Directors of the IPO
Pushdown Entity have approved the IPO Event.

Person as a consequence of this paragraph (a), any term of any Debt Document which
requires or assumes that any person be a Released Person or that any liabilities or obligations
to such person be subject to this Agreement or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

(b) Each Party (other than a member of the Group) shall be required to enter into any
amendment to, release of, or replacement of any Debt Document required by the Company
and/or take such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate or reflect
any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (a) above, provided that such amendment,
replacement or other document or instrument does not impose personal obligations on the
Security Agent or, affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunity of the
Security Agent under such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument. The
Agent and the Security Agents are each irrevocably authorised and instructed by each

A-63


-----

applicable Party to execute any such amended or replacement Debt Document and/or take
other such action on behalf of such Parties (and shall do so on the request of the Company).

(c) Following an IPO Event, with the consent of each of the Majority Senior Lenders, the
Majority Senior Secured Noteholders, the Majority Second Lien Lenders, the Majority Second
Lien Noteholders, the Majority Topco Lenders and the Majority Topco Noteholders (in such
percentages pro forma to their participations in the applicable Debt Documents after the IPO
Event to the extent continuing and as applicable for the purposes of those definitions at such
time), each Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from all obligations as Debtor and Guarantor under the Debt Documents and any
Transaction Security granted by any such Subsidiary.

(d) Each Hedge Counterparty agrees that the occurrence of an IPO Event (or the operation of
any of the steps in paragraph (a), (b) and (c) above) shall not give rise to a right by such
Hedge Counterparty to terminate or close-out in whole or in part any hedging transaction
under a Hedging Agreement irrespective of the terms of the Hedging Agreement.

(e) If the Company delivers an IPO Pushdown Notice pursuant to paragraph (a) above in relation
to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that IPO Pushdown Notice at any
time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to each Agent, the
Security Agent and each Hedge Counterparty. In the event that any IPO Pushdown Notice is
revoked in accordance with this paragraph (e):

(i) the provisions of paragraphs (a)(i) to (a)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that
IPO Pushdown Notice;

(ii) if any Transaction Security has been released pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c) above in

Principles, the relevant member of the Group shall as soon as reasonably practicable
execute a replacement Transaction Security Document in respect of that Transaction
Security; and

(iii) if any Party in the capacity of a Released Person has been released from this Agreement
pursuant to paragraphs (a)(vi), (a)(vii) or (c) above in reliance on that IPO Pushdown
Notice, if required by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Second Lien
Creditors and the Majority Topco Creditors (acting reasonably) by prior written notice to
the Company and that person, that person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede
to this Agreement as the applicable Released Person by executing a Creditor/Agent
Accession Undertaking.

For the avoidance of doubt:

(A) nothing in this paragraph (e) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Company from
delivering a further IPO Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated
IPO Event; and

(B) revocation of an IPO Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to,
directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking or other term in a Debt Document or a Default or an Event of Default
(whether by reason of any action or step taken by any person, or any matter or
circumstance arising or committed, while that IPO Pushdown Notice was effective or
otherwise).

For the purpose of this Clause 1.12, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any member of the
Group or a Holding Company of the Company notified to each Agent, the Security Agent
and each Hedge Counterparty by the Company in writing as the person to be treated as the

A-64

a Distress Event, a settlement amount or other amount (following the application of any
Close-Out Netting, Payment Netting or Inter-Hedging Agreement Netting in respect of that
Hedging Agreement) falls due from a Hedge Counterparty to the relevant Debtor, then that

proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security and applied in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

(b) The payment of that amount by the Hedge Counterparty to the Security Agent in accordance
with paragraph (a) above shall discharge the Hedge Counterparty’s obligation to pay that
amount to that Debtor.

**4.12 Terms of Hedging Agreements**

The Hedge Counterparties (to the extent party to the Hedging Agreement in question) and the
Debtors party to the Hedging Agreements shall ensure that, at all times:

(i) on an ISDA Master Agreement; or

(ii) on another framework agreement which is similar in effect to an ISDA Master
Agreement;

(b) in the event of a termination of the hedging transaction entered into under a Hedging
Agreement, whether as a result of the occurrence of:

(i) a Termination Event or an Event of Default, each as defined in the relevant Hedging
Agreement (where that Hedging Agreement is based on an ISDA Master Agreement); or

(ii) an event similar in meaning and effect to those described in paragraph (i) above (where
that Hedging Agreement is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement),

that Hedging Agreement will:

“Second Method” and will make no material amendment to section 6(e) (Payments
on Early Termination) of the ISDA Master Agreement;

(B) if it is based on a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement, make no material amendment to
the provisions of section 6(e) (Payments on Early Termination) of the ISDA Master
Agreement; or

(C) if it is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement, provide for any other method of
determining the amount, if any, payable in respect of that termination, the effect of
which is that the party to which that event is referable will be entitled to receive
payment under the relevant termination provisions if the net replacement value of
all terminated transactions entered into under that Hedging Agreement is in its
favour; and

(c) each Hedging Agreement shall provide that the relevant Hedge Counterparty will be entitled
to designate an Early Termination Date (as defined in the relevant Hedging Agreement) or
otherwise be able to terminate each transaction under such Hedging Agreement if so
required pursuant to Clause 4.10 (Required Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties).

_Hedging Liabilities), Clause 4.5 (No Acquisition of Hedging Liabilities) or Clause 4.9 (Permitted_
_Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties) by reason of the consent of the Majority Senior Secured_
Creditors will only be permitted to the extent that that action would not result in the Group
ceasing to be in compliance with any minimum hedging requirements under any Second Lien
Finance Document or Topco Finance Document.

(a) The Topco Creditor Representative(s) (on behalf of the Purchasing Topco Creditors, acting as
a whole) may, by giving not less than 10 days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent,
require a Hedge Transfer:

(i) if either:

(A) the Purchasing Topco Creditors require, at the same time, a Senior Secured Creditor
Liabilities Transfer and a Second Lien Creditor Liabilities Transfer under Clause 6.14
(Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors); or

(B) all the Purchasing Topco Creditors require that Hedge Transfer at any time on or

Date, the Cash Management Facility Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Notes
Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date; and

Agreements, in which case no Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or other member
of the Group shall be entitled to withhold its consent to that transfer;

Third Party Security Provider or other member of the Group) relating to that transfer

as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

(D) as a result of that transfer, the Hedge Counterparties have no further actual or
contingent liability to any Debtor under the Hedging Agreements;

(E) an indemnity is provided from (or on behalf of) Purchasing Topco Creditor (but, for
the avoidance of doubt, this does not include a Topco Creditor Representative)
which is receiving (or for which a nominee is receiving) that transfer (or from
another third party acceptable to the relevant Hedge Counterparty) in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Hedge Counterparty in respect of all losses
which may be sustained or incurred by that Hedge Counterparty in consequence of
any sum received or recovered by that Hedge Counterparty being required (or it
being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from the Hedge
Counterparty for any reason; and

(F) that transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the
relevant Hedge Counterparty, except that the relevant Hedge Counterparty shall be
deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has
the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to
authorise the making by it of that transfer.

(b) The Topco Creditor Representative(s) (acting on behalf of the Purchasing Topco Creditors)
and any Hedge Counterparty may agree (in respect of the Hedging Agreements (or one or

A-102

more of them) to which that Hedge Counterparty is a party) that a Hedge Transfer required
by the Purchasing Topco Creditors pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall not apply to that
Hedging Agreement(s) or to the Hedging Liabilities and Hedge Counterparty Obligations
under that Hedging Agreement(s).

(c) If the Topco Creditor Representative(s) are entitled to require a Hedge Transfer under this

**10.4 Permitted Assurance and Receipts**

Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the ability of any Secured Creditor to:

(a) arrange with any person which is not a member of the Group, a Third Party Security Provider

and that Secured Creditor shall not be obliged to account to any other Party for any sum received
by it as a result of that action.

If any of the Debtors, any Third Party Security Provider or any Topco Independent Obligor
receives or recovers any sum which, under the terms of any of the Debt Documents, should have
been paid to the Security Agent, or any Soulte, that Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or, as
the case may be, Topco Independent Obligor will:

(a) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the Relevant Liabilities (or, if less, the

(b) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery
exceeds the Relevant Liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

**10.6 Saving Provision**

If, for any reason, any of the trusts expressed to be created in this Clause 10 should fail or be
unenforceable, the affected Creditor, Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or Topco Independent
Obligor will promptly pay an amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent to
be held on trust by the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

**10.7 Payment of the Soulte**

If in the context of an Enforcement Action, a Soulte is owed by the Secured Parties to any Topco
Independent Obligor, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor, such Soulte shall be payable:

(a) only by the relevant Creditors having participated in the relevant Enforcement Action (pro
rata to the amount of Liabilities which have been discharged as a result of such Enforcement
Action); and

(b) only on the earlier of:

(i) the Final Discharge Date; and

(ii) the date falling 12 months, after the date of such Enforcement Action (in which case, the
_Soulte shall be paid to the Security Agent in accordance with the provisions of Clause_
10.5 (Sums received by Debtors and Third Party Security Providers)).

**11. REDISTRIBUTION**

**11.1 Recovering Creditor’s Rights**

(a) Any amount paid by a Creditor (a “Recovering Creditor”) to the Security Agent under Clause
9 (Effect of Insolvency Event) or Clause 10 (Turnover of Receipts) shall be treated as having
been paid by the relevant Debtor or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider and
distributed to the Security Agent, Agents, Arrangers and Secured Creditors (each, a “Sharing
**Creditor”) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.**

(b) On a distribution by the Security Agent under paragraph (a) above of a Payment received by
a Recovering Creditor from a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, as between the
relevant Debtor or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider and the Recovering
Creditor, an amount equal to the amount received or recovered by the Recovering Creditor
and paid to the Security Agent (as the case may be) (the “Shared Amount”) will be treated as
not having been paid by that Debtor, or as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider.

**11.2 Reversal of Redistribution**

(a) If any part of the Shared Amount received or recovered by a Recovering Creditor becomes
repayable to a Debtor or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider and is repaid by
that Recovering Creditor to that Debtor, or as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider,
then:

(i) each Sharing Creditor shall (subject in the case of Notes Trustee Amounts to paragraphs
(a) and (c) of Clause 28.1 (Liability)), upon request of the Security Agent, pay to that
Security Agent for the account of that Recovering Creditor an amount equal to the
appropriate part of its share of the Shared Amount (together with an amount as is
necessary to reimburse that Recovering Creditor for its proportion of any interest on the
Shared Amount which that Recovering Creditor is required to pay) (the “Redistributed
**Amount”); and**

A-112


-----

(ii) as between the relevant Debtor or Third Party Security Provider and each relevant
Sharing Creditor, an amount equal to the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated
as not having been paid by that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider.

(b) The Security Agent shall not be obliged to pay any Redistributed Amount to a Recovering
Creditor under paragraph (a) above until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction that
it has actually received that Redistributed Amount from the relevant Sharing Creditor.

**11.3 Deferral of Subrogation**

No Creditor, Debtor or Third Party Security Provider will exercise any rights which it may have by
reason of the performance by it of its obligations under the Debt Documents to take the benefit
(in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights under the
Debt Documents of any Creditor which ranks ahead of it in accordance with the priorities set out
in Clause 2 (Ranking and Priority) until such time as all of the Liabilities owing to each prior
ranking Creditor (or, in the case of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, owing to each
Creditor) have been irrevocably paid in full.

then entitled to give to the Security Agent under Clause 5.10 (Permitted Second Lien
_Enforcement)._

(d) Prior to the Priority Discharge Date:

(i) if the Instructing Group (or the Majority Second Lien Creditors pursuant to paragraph

Transaction Security; or

(ii) in the absence of instructions from the Instructing Group (or the Majority Second Lien
Creditors pursuant to paragraph (c) above),

Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the
Transaction Security which the Majority Topco Creditors are then entitled to give to the
Security Agent under Clause 6.10 (Permitted Topco Enforcement) respectively.

(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) above, if at any time any Second Lien Agent or

Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security pursuant to the preceding
paragraphs (c) and (d) and the Second Lien Agent, the Second Lien Notes Trustee and/or the
Topco Creditor Representative (as applicable) give such instruction or indicate any intention
to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any
instructions to enforce given by the Second Lien Agent, the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the
Topco Creditor Representative under this Agreement and Security Agent shall act on such
instructions received from the Instructing Group.

(c) prior to the Priority Discharge Date, if:

instructions to the manner of enforcement of the Transaction Security,

as the Majority Topco Creditors shall instruct; or

(d) in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include
taking no action).

**12.5 Exercise of Voting Rights**

(a) Each Creditor and the Company, each Topco Investor, each Intra-Group Lender, each Third
Party Security Provider and each Subordinated Creditor agrees (to the fullest extent
permitted by law at the relevant time) with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any
proposal put to the vote by or under the supervision of any judicial or supervisory authority
in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating
to any member of the Group or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider, as
instructed by the Security Agent.

(b) Subject to paragraph (c) below, the Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of
paragraph (a) of this Clause 12.5 as directed by an Instructing Group provided such

(c) Nothing in this Clause 12.5 entitles any party to exercise or require any other Secured Party
to exercise such power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge or extend the
due date for (or change the basis for accrual of any) payment of or reschedule any of the
Liabilities owed to that Secured Party.

**12.6 Waiver of Rights**

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to Clause 12.3 (Enforcement
_Instructions—Transaction Security), Clause 12.4 (Manner of Enforcement—Transaction Security),_
Clause 16 (Application of Proceeds) and paragraph (c) of Clause 15.2 (Distressed Disposals), each
Secured Party, Third Party Security Provider and Debtor waives all rights it may otherwise have to
require that the Transaction Security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any
particular time or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the
enforcement of any of the Transaction Security or of any other security interest, which is capable
of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Secured Obligations is so applied.

**12.7 Duties Owed**

(a) Each of the Secured Parties, the Third Party Security Providers and the Debtors acknowledges

Security prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of
any Receiver or Delegate owed to the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors in
respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation,
management or realisation of any of that Transaction Security shall, subject to paragraph
(g) of Clause 15.2 (Distressed Disposals), be no different to or greater than the duty that is

A-115


-----

owed by the Security Agent (or, as the case may be, that Receiver or that Delegate) to the
Debtors or Third Party Security Providers under general law. The duty of care owed (whether
under this Agreement or under general law) by the Security Agent to the Second Lien
Creditors and the Topco Creditors shall be the same whether or not the Second Lien
Creditors and the Topco Creditors are creditors at the relevant entity at which enforcement is
being conducted or are beneficiaries of the Security that is being enforced. The Security
Agent shall promptly upon becoming aware provide the Second Lien Creditors and the
Topco Creditors notification of the scheduling of any court or administrative hearings
relating to any Enforcement Action with respect to the Transaction Security.

(b) Each of the Secured Parties, Third Party Security Providers and the Debtors acknowledges
that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces or is instructed to enforce the Transaction
Security after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the
duties of the Security Agent and of any Receiver or Delegate owed to any Secured Party in
respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation,
management or realisation of any of that Transaction Security shall, subject to paragraph
(c) of Clause 15.2 (Distressed Disposals), be no different to or greater than the duty that is
owed by the Security Agent, Receiver or Delegate to the Debtors or Third Party Security
Providers under general law.

**12.8 Security held by other Creditors**

If any Transaction Security is held by a Creditor other than the Security Agent, then creditors may
only enforce that Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing
Group in accordance with this Clause 12 (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent
shall be construed as references to that Creditor).

**12.9 Consultation Period**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action, the Agent(s) of the
Creditors represented in the Instructing Group concerned shall consult with each other Agent
(provided that a Topco Agent or Topco Notes Trustee need only be consulted if such
Enforcement Action relates to Topco Shared Security) and the Security Agent in good faith
about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group for a period of up to ten Business
Days (or such shorter period as each other Agent and the Security Agent shall agree) (the
“Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a Consultation Period, shall the
Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) No Agent shall be obliged to consult in accordance with paragraph (a) above and the
Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce
the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a
Consultation Period if:

(i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any Agent of the Creditors represented in the Instructing Group
determines in good faith (and notifies each Agent and the Security Agent) that to enter
into such consultation and delay the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction
Security could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security; or

(B) the realisation proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security.

**13. ENFORCEMENT OF TRANSACTION SECURITY ON OR AFTER THE DESIGNATION DATE**

Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable);
or

(iii) by, if required under paragraph (h) below, the Topco Creditor Representative(s) (acting
on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors, as applicable).

(b) Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to
issue Enforcement Instructions, the Agents (and, if applicable, Hedge Counterparties)
representing the Secured Creditors comprising the Majority Super Senior Creditors or
Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as the case may be) shall deliver a copy of those proposed
Enforcement Instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent, each Senior
Agent, each Super Senior Agent, each Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each Hedge
Counterparty which did not deliver such Initial Enforcement Notice, and those Enforcement
Instructions shall be consistent with the Enforcement Principles.

(c) Subject to paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) below, the Security Agent will act in accordance with
Enforcement Instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that
such instructions are consistent with the Enforcement Principles (and the Security Agent shall
be entitled to assume that such instructions are consistent with the Enforcement Principles)
and failure to give Enforcement Instructions will be deemed to be an instruction not to take
any Enforcement Action.

(d) If:

(i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not either made a determination as to the
method of Enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified
the Security Agent of that determination in writing) within three months of the date of
the Initial Enforcement Notice; or

(ii) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the date of the
Initial Enforcement Notice,

then the Security Agent will act in accordance with Enforcement Instructions received from
the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

(e) If an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by any Enforcement
Action taken by or at the request or direction of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing then
the Security Agent will, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors elect to provide
such Enforcement Instructions, act in accordance with Enforcement Instructions received
from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

A-117


-----

(f) If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
Enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security
Agent of that determination in writing) and the Majority Super Senior Creditors:

(i) determine in good faith (and notify the other Senior Agents, each Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, the Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that a delay in issuing
Enforcement Instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security or on the
expected realisation proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security; and

(ii) deliver Enforcement Instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the
Enforcement Principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving
the Enforcement Objective before the Security Agent has received any Enforcement
Instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,

then the Security Agent will act in accordance with the Enforcement Instructions received
from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

(g) Prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date:

(i) if both the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Super Senior Creditors
have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Transaction
Security; or

(ii) in the absence of instructions from either STLDD Instructing Group,

and, in each case, neither STLDD Instructing Group has required any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any
instructions to enforce the Transaction Security which the Majority Second Lien Creditors are
then entitled to give to the Security Agent under Clause 5.10 (Permitted Second Lien
_Enforcement)._

(h) Prior to the Priority Discharge Date:

(i) if both the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Super Senior Creditors (or
the Majority Second Lien Creditors pursuant to paragraph (g) above) have instructed the
Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Transaction Security; or

(ii) in the absence of instructions from either STLDD Instructing Group (or the Majority
Second Lien Creditors pursuant to paragraph (g) above),

and, in each case, neither STLDD Instructing Group (nor the Majority Second Lien Creditors
pursuant to paragraph (g) above) has required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to
make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce
the Transaction Security which the Majority Topco Creditors are then entitled to give to the
Security Agent under Clause 6.10 (Permitted Topco Enforcement) respectively.

(i) Notwithstanding paragraphs (g) and (h) above, if at any time any Second Lien Agent or
Second Lien Notes Trustee or Topco Creditor Representative is then entitled to give the
Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security pursuant to the preceding
paragraph (g) and (h) and the Second Lien Agent, the Second Lien Notes Trustee and/or the
Topco Creditor Representative (as applicable) give such instruction or indicate any intention
to give such instruction, then each STLDD Instructing Group may give instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as such STLDD Instructing Group sees fit in
lieu of any instructions to enforce given by the Second Lien Agent, the Second Lien Notes
Trustee or the Topco Creditor Representative under this Agreement and Security Agent shall
act on such instructions received from such STLDD Instructing Group.

Secured Party, Third Party Security Provider and Debtor waives all rights it may otherwise have to

particular time or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the
enforcement of any of the Transaction Security or of any other security interest, which is capable
of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Secured Obligations is so applied.

**13.7 Duties Owed**

no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent (or, as the case

Receiver or Delegate owed to any Secured Party in respect of the method, type and timing of
that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realisation of any of that
Transaction Security shall, subject to paragraph (c) of Clause 15.2 (Distressed Disposals), be no
different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, Receiver or
Delegate to the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers under general law.

**13.8 Security held by other Creditors**

If any Transaction Security is held by a Creditor other than the Security Agent, then creditors may
only enforce that Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing
Group in accordance with this Clause 13 (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent
shall be construed as references to that Creditor).

**13.9 Enforcement through Security Agent Only**

the Transaction Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the
Security Documents except through the Security Agent.

limitation, the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be
appointed by the Security Agent) as the Majority Topco Creditors shall instruct or, in the absence
of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

**14.4 Waiver of Rights**

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to Clause 14.2 (Enforcement
_Instructions—Topco Independent Transaction Security), Clause 14.3 (Manner of Enforcement—_
_Topco Independent Transaction Security), Clause 16 (Application of Proceeds) and paragraph_
(c) of Clause 15.2 (Distressed Disposals), each Secured Party, Third Party Security Provider and
Debtor waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the Topco Independent
Transaction Security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time or
that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of
the Topco Independent Transaction Security or of any other security interest, which is capable of
being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Topco Independent Secured Obligations is so
applied.

**14.5 Duties Owed with respect to Topco Independent Transaction Security**

Each of the Secured Parties, the Third Party Security Providers and the Debtors acknowledges
that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces or is instructed to enforce any Topco

of any Receiver or Delegate owed to the Topco Creditors in respect of the method, type and
timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realisation of any of that
Topco Independent Transaction Security shall, subject to paragraph (g) of Clause 15.2 (Distressed
_Disposals), be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent (or, as_
the case may be, that Receiver or that Delegate) to the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers
under general law. The duty of care owed (whether under this Agreement or under general law)

by the Security Agent to the Topco Creditors shall be the same whether or not the Topco
Creditors are creditors at the relevant entity at which enforcement is being conducted or are
beneficiaries of the Topco Independent Transaction Security that is being enforced. The Security
Agent shall promptly upon becoming aware provide the Topco Creditors notification of the
scheduling of any court or administrative hearings relating to any Enforcement Action with
respect to the Topco Independent Transaction Security.

**14.6Topco Independent Transaction Security held by other Creditors**

If any Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a Creditor other than the Security
Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security in accordance with instructions
given by the Majority Topco Creditors in accordance with this Clause 14 (and for this purpose
references to the Security Agent shall be construed as references to that Creditor).

applicable, Lower Ranking Security) and/or agrees to any amendment of a Security
Document required under the terms of that New Debt Financing or as may be required
under any applicable law in order to give effect to the ranking set out in Clause 2.2
(Transaction Security), in each case, subject to, the provisions of the Agreed Security
Principles and the requirements of Clause 18.2 (Transaction Security: New Debt Financings).

**18.2 Transaction Security: New Debt Financings**

Notwithstanding any other term, condition or restriction in any other Debt Document, the Parties
agree that, in connection with a New Debt Financing, each Agent and the Security Agent (and
any other Creditor party to a Transaction Security Document or a Topco Independent Transaction
Security Document (as the case may be)) are authorised and instructed by all Creditors (and in
each case are obliged at the request and cost of the Company) to enter into promptly any new
Security Document, promptly amend or waive any terms of an existing Security Document and/or
promptly release any asset from Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
(as the case may be), provided that, with respect to the granting of new Transaction Security
(over assets, rights or interests, or classes or types of assets, rights or interests not already the
subject of an existing Security Document) only, the obligations hereunder shall only extend to
such Transaction Security that the Security Agent and Agent are permitted to take and hold
under applicable law and/or the policies and rules of the Security Agent and Agent in effect at
the time, subject to the following conditions:

(a) any new Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be)
in relation to such New Debt Financing shall be:

(i) subject to the Agreed Security Principles, Guarantee Limitations, applicable law and the
other terms of this Agreement, granted in favour of the then existing Secured Parties or
the then existing Topco Secured Parties (as the case may be, or in each case, class
thererof) or to the Security Agent on their behalf;

(ii) unless otherwise agreed by the Company, on terms substantially the same (except that it
shall also secure any New Debt Financing) as the terms of the existing Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) over equivalent
asset(s); and

A-141


-----

(iii) for the purposes of this Agreement, be considered as having secured the relevant
Liabilities pari passu with the then existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security (as the case may be);

(b) any amendment or waiver of a Security Document or release and re-grant of Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) shall only be
undertaken if required by the terms or conditions of the New Debt Financing or to the
extent necessary under applicable law to give effect to the ranking set out in Clause 2.2
(Transaction Security); and (if legally possible and in the opinion of the Company (acting
reasonably) it is commercially feasible to do so and without breach of any term or condition
of any New Debt Financing) where the Transaction Security is intended to secure any
relevant Liabilities, second or further priority (if applicable) Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) (the “Additional Transaction Security
**Documents”) will be taken instead of releasing and re-granting the existing Transaction**
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) but will nonetheless
be deemed and treated for the purposes of this Agreement as secured by the existing
Transaction Security Documents and the Additional Transaction Security Documents pari
passu with other Liabilities which would otherwise have the same ranking as contemplated
by such New Debt Financing;

(c) if any asset is to be released from Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security (as the case may be), promptly upon giving effect to that release, replacement
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) is,
subject to applicable law, the Debt Documents, the Agreed Security Principles, Guarantee
Limitations and other terms of this Agreement, granted in favour of the Security Agent for
and on behalf of the providers and/or agents and/or trustees of the New Debt Financing and
(in relation to Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case
may be)) the existing Secured Parties or Topco Creditors (as the case may be) benefitting
from the Security on substantially the same terms as the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) released (except that it shall also
secure any New Debt Financing); and

(d) to the extent customary to be given in such jurisdiction and subject to qualifications
reflecting applicable law at such time, legal opinions as to due capacity, authority, execution
and enforceability (together with customary supporting legal documentation, certificates
and resolutions) are issued in relation to re-taken, new or amended Security Documents in
connection with a New Debt Financing, the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on such
legal opinions and shall receive documentary evidence of such reliance.

For the purpose of the Company determining if a matter is “commercially feasible” under this
Clause, the Company may take into account (among other things in its good faith opinion) any
action which is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the borrowing, incurring,
assumption, establishment (including pricing and commercial terms thereof), underwriting,
placing, distribution or any other similar action; obtaining any consent, approval, release or
waiver or agreement to any amendment in connection therewith (in the good faith judgment of
the board of directors of the Company (for which it can conclusively rely on advice and market
feedback of the arrangers of such New Debt Financing)), and the Company shall not be acting
unreasonably if it considers that a particular action is reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on the borrowing, incurring, assumption, establishment (including pricing and commercial
terms thereof), underwriting, placing, distribution or any other similar action; obtaining any
consent, approval, release or waiver or agreement to any amendment in connection therewith
(in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Company (for which it can
conclusively rely on advice and market feedback of the arrangers of such New Debt Financing)).

Trustee shall have an obligation to indemnify (out of its personal assets) any other person,

an opinion of counsel or opinion of another qualified expert, at the expense of the Company

# SCHEDULE 6 Enforcement Principles

1. In this Schedule 6:

“Enforcement Objective” means maximising, to the extent consistent with a prompt and
expeditious realisation of value, the value realised from Enforcement.

“Fairness Opinion” means, in respect of any Enforcement, an opinion from a reputable,
independent and internationally recognised investment bank, firm of accounts or third party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in issuing such opinions (a “Financial Adviser”) that
the proceeds received or recovered in connection with that Enforcement are fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances.

2. Any Enforcement pursuant to Clause 13 (Enforcement of Transaction Security on or after the
_Designation Date) shall be consistent with the Enforcement Objective._

3. Without prejudice to the Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security will be enforced
and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either:

(a) to the extent the STLDD Instructing Group is the Majority Super Senior Creditors, all
proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in
accordance with Clause 16 (Application of Proceeds); or

(b) to the extent the STLDD Instructing Group is the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
Enforcement Action is taken by either the Majority Second Lien Creditors or, as the case
may be, the Majority Topco Creditors either:

(i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for
distribution in accordance with Clause 16 (Application of Proceeds); or

(ii) sufficient proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash
to ensure that, when the proceeds are applied in accordance with Clause 16
(Application of Proceeds), the Super Senior Discharge Date will occur (unless the
Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

4. On:

(a) a proposed Enforcement in relation to assets comprising Charged Property other than
shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists, where the
aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other
currency or currencies); or

(b) a proposed Enforcement in relation to Charged Property comprising some or all of the
shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists,

which, in either case, is not being effected through a Competitive Sales Process, the Security
Agent shall, if requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, appoint a Financial Adviser to provide a Fairness Opinion in relation to that
Enforcement, provided that the Security Agent shall not be required to appoint a Financial
Adviser nor obtain a Fairness Opinion if a proposed Enforcement:

(i) would result in the receipt of sufficient Enforcement Proceeds in cash by the Security
Agent to ensure that, after application in accordance with Clause 16 (Application of
_Proceeds):_

(A) in the case of an Enforcement requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the
Senior Secured Discharge Date would occur; or

A-198


-----

(B) in the case of an Enforcement requested by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
the Super Senior Discharge Date would occur;

(ii) is in accordance with any applicable law; and

(iii) complies with Clause 15.2 (Distressed Disposals).

5. The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Adviser or to seek the
advice of a Financial Adviser unless expressly required to do so by this Schedule 6 or any
other provision of this Agreement.

6. The Fairness Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation
to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial
point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence
that the Enforcement Principles have been met.

7. In the absence of written notice from a Secured Creditor or group of Secured Creditors, that
such Secured Creditor(s) Creditor(s) object to any enforcement of any Transaction Security on
the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Enforcement
Objective, the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such enforcement of any Transaction
Security is in accordance with the Enforcement Objective.

8. If the Security Agent is unable to obtain a Fairness Opinion after attempting to do so (and
after considering making such modifications to the enforcement process as may be
reasonably available and consistent with the Enforcement Principles to obtain such opinion)
because such opinions are not generally available in the market in such circumstances it shall
notify each Senior Creditor Representative and may proceed to enforce any Transaction
Security without needing to demonstrate (by way of a Fairness Opinion or otherwise) that
such enforcement is aiming to achieve the Enforcement Objective.

# SCHEDULE 7 Hedge Counterparties’ Guarantee and Indemnity

**1.** **Guarantee and indemnity**

Each Hedging Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

(a) guarantees to each Hedge Counterparty punctual performance by each other Hedging
Debtor of all that Hedging Debtor’s obligations under the Hedging Agreements;

(b) undertakes with each Hedge Counterparty that whenever another Hedging Debtor does not
pay any amount when due (allowing for any applicable grace period) under or in connection
with any Hedging Agreement, that Hedging Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay
that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and

(c) agrees with each Hedge Counterparty that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes
unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation,
indemnify that Hedge Counterparty immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability
it incurs as a result of the Company or a Hedging Debtor not paying any amount which
would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under
any Hedging Agreement on the date when it would have been due.

The amount payable by a Hedging Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it
would have had to pay under this Schedule 7 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the
basis of a guarantee.

**2.** **Continuing Guarantee**

This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums
payable by the Company or any Hedging Debtor under the Hedging Agreements, regardless of
any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.

**3.** **Reinstatement**

If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of the Company
or any Hedging Debtor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Hedge
Counterparty in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which
is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without
limitation, then the liability of each Hedging Guarantor under this Schedule 7 will continue or be
reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.

**4.** **Waiver of defences**

The obligations of each Hedging Guarantor under this Schedule 7 will not be affected by an act,
omission, matter or thing which, but for this Schedule 7, would reduce, release or prejudice any
of its obligations under this Schedule 7 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or
any Hedge Counterparty) including:

(a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Hedging Debtor or other
person;

(b) the release of any other Hedging Debtor or any other person under the terms of any
composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;

(c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to
perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Hedging Debtor
or other person or any non-presentation or non observance of any formality or other
requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any
security;

A-200


-----

(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in
the members or status of a Hedging Debtor or any other person;

(e) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension restatement (however fundamental and
whether or not more onerous) or replacement of a Hedging Agreement or any other
document or security;

(f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any
Hedging Agreement or any other document or security; or

(g) any insolvency or similar proceedings.

**5.** **Hedging Guarantor Intent**

Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 4 (Waiver of defences), but subject to the
guarantee limitations set out in paragraphs 11 (Guarantee Limitations: General) to 14 (Additional
_Guarantee Limitations) (inclusive) below, each Hedging Guarantor expressly confirms that it_
intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental and of
whatsoever nature and whether or not more onerous) variation, increase, extension or addition
of or to any of the Hedging Agreements and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any
Hedging Agreement.

**6.** **Immediate recourse**

Each Hedging Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Hedge Counterparty
(or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security
or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Hedging Guarantor under this
Schedule 7. This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Hedging Agreement
to the contrary.

**7.** **Appropriations**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Hedging Debtors under or in
connection with the Hedging Agreements have been irrevocably paid in full, each Hedge
Counterparty (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:

(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by
that Hedge Counterparty (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts,
or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those
amounts or otherwise) and no Hedging Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the
same; and

(b) in respect of any amounts received or recovered by any Hedge Counterparty after a claim
pursuant to this guarantee in respect of any sum due and payable by any Hedging Guarantor
under this Schedule 7 place such amounts in a suspense account (bearing interest at a market
rate used for accounts of that type) unless and until such moneys are sufficient in aggregate
to discharge in full all amounts then due and payable under this guarantee or any other
Hedging Agreement.

**8.** **Deferral of Hedging Guarantors’ rights**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Hedging Debtors under or in
connection with the Hedging Agreements have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the
Security Agent otherwise directs, no Hedging Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may
have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Hedging Agreements or by
reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Schedule 7:

(a) to be indemnified by a Hedging Debtor;

A-201


-----

(b) to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Hedging Debtor’s obligations
under the Hedging Agreements;

(c) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of
any rights of the Hedge Counterparties under the Hedging Agreements or of any other
guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Hedging Agreements by
any Hedge Counterparty;

(d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Hedging Debtor to make any
payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Hedging Guarantor has given a
guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under paragraph 1 (Guarantee and indemnity) above;

(e) to exercise any right of set off against any Hedging Debtor; and/or

(f) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Hedging Debtor in competition with any Hedge
Counterparty.

If a Hedging Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it
shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts
which may be or become payable to the Hedge Counterparties by the Hedging Debtors under or
in connection with the Hedging Agreements to be repaid in full on trust for, or if the concept of
trust is not recognised in the jurisdiction of incorporation of that Hedging Guarantor, for the
benefit of, the Hedge Counterparties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Security
Agent or as the Security Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause 16
(Application of Proceeds).

**9.** **Release of Hedging Guarantors’ right of contribution**

If any Hedging Guarantor (a “Retiring Hedging Guarantor”) ceases to be a Hedging Guarantor in
accordance with the terms of the Hedging Agreements for the purpose of any sale or other
disposal of that Retiring Hedging Guarantor or any of its Holding Companies then on the date
such Retiring Hedging Guarantor ceases to be a Hedging Guarantor:

(a) that Retiring Hedging Guarantor is released by each other Hedging Guarantor from any
liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a
contribution to any other Hedging Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any
other Hedging Guarantor of its obligations under the Hedging Agreements; and

(b) each other Hedging Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance
of its obligations under the Hedging Agreements to take the benefit (in whole or in part and
whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Hedge Counterparties
under any Hedging Agreement or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection
with, any Hedging Agreement where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to
the assets of the Retiring Hedging Guarantor.

**10. Additional security**

The guarantee contained in this Schedule 7 is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by
any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Hedge Counterparty.

**11. Guarantee Limitations: General**

(a) The guarantee contained in this Schedule 7 does not apply to any liability to the extent that
it would result in this guarantee constituting unlawful financial assistance within the
meaning of sections 678 or 679 of the Companies Act 2006 or any equivalent and applicable
provisions under the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant Hedging
Guarantor and, with respect to any additional Hedging Guarantor, is subject to any
limitations set out in the Accession Deed applicable to such additional Hedging Guarantor.

A-202


-----

(b) If, notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, the obligations being guaranteed under this
Schedule 7 (the “Guarantee Obligations”) or Transaction Security would be unlawful
financial assistance, then, to the extent necessary to give effect to paragraph (a) above, the
obligations under the Hedging Agreements will be deemed to have been split into two
tranches; “Tranche 1” comprising those obligations which may be secured by the Guarantee
Obligations or Transaction Security without breaching relevant financial assistance laws and
“Tranche 2” comprising the remainder of the obligations under the Hedging Agreements.
The Tranche 2 obligations will be excluded from the Guarantee Obligations.

**12. French Guarantee Limitations**

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any obligations or liabilities incurred or assumed
under or in connection with the guarantee provided by any of the French Hedging
Guarantors pursuant to this Schedule 7 shall not include any obligations or liabilities which if
incurred would constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of article
L.225-216 of the French Commercial Code or/and would constitute a misuse of corporate
assets within the meaning of article L.241-3, L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Commercial
Code or any replacement law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by French
courts.

(b) In any case, the obligations and liabilities incurred by any French Hedging Guarantor under
or in connection with this Schedule 7 insofar as required to guarantee the payment
obligations, under the Finance Documents, of any Obligor which is not a direct or indirect
Subsidiary of that French Hedging Guarantor (the Non Subsidiary Guaranteed Obligor), shall
be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(i) all Indebtedness borrowed by each such Non Subsidiary Guaranteed Obligor (as
Borrower) and made available by it directly or indirectly by way of intra-group loans,
bonds or advances or any similar arrangements to that French Hedging Guarantor or its
Subsidiaries; and

(ii) all Indebtedness borrowed or incurred under intra-group loans, bonds or advances or
any similar arrangements made available directly or indirectly to that French Hedging
Guarantor or its Subsidiaries with the proceeds of Indebtedness previously incurred by a
Holding Company of such French Hedging Guarantor to the extent that such
Indebtedness is or has been refinanced directly or indirectly with the proceeds of
Indebtedness of Non Subsidiary Guaranteed Obligors constituting Secured Liabilities
provided that the aggregate amount guaranteed by such French Hedging Guarantor
pursuant to this sub-paragraph (ii) shall not exceed the aggregate amount of then
outstanding Intra-Group Debt (as defined below) referred to in this sub-paragraph (ii) or
any equivalent provision under any guarantee granted by such French Hedging
Guarantor under a Secured Debt Document,

(together Intra-Group Debt),

(c) and which, in each case, are outstanding on the date on which a demand for payment is
made to such French Hedging Guarantor; it being specified that:

(d) any payment made by such French Hedging Guarantor under this Schedule 7 shall reduce pro
tanto the outstanding amount of the Intra-Group Debt (if any) due by such French Hedging
Guarantor; and

(e) any Intra-Group Debt made available directly or indirectly to a French Hedging Guarantor
may not be double counted with the portion of such Intra-Group Debt which has been
on-lent by that French Hedging Guarantor to its Subsidiaries.

(f) The obligations and liabilities incurred or assumed by any French Hedging Guarantor under
or in connection with this Schedule 7 insofar as required to guarantee the payment

A-203


-----

obligations of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, will not in relation to any amount due under
or in connection with this Schedule 7, be limited and will therefore include all amounts due
by such Subsidiaries under the Finance Documents.

(g) It is acknowledged that any payment made by a French Hedging Guarantor (other than any
French Hedging Guarantor that is a Holding Company of the Company) under this Schedule 7
or of the Intra-Group Debt shall reduce the maximum amount of its guarantee under this
Schedule 7.

**13. Luxembourg Guarantee Limitations**

(a) The maximum liability of any Luxembourg Hedging Guarantor under the guarantee set out
in this Schedule 7 together with any similar guarantee or indemnity obligation of the
Luxembourg Hedging Guarantor under or in connection with any Hedging Agreements for
the obligations of any Hedging Debtor which is not a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
Luxembourg Guarantor shall be limited to an amount not exceeding the greater of (without
double counting):

(i) 95 per cent. of the Luxembourg Hedging Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres), as
referred to in annex I to the grand-ducal regulation dated 18 December 2015 defining
the form and content of the presentation of balance sheet and profit and loss account,
and enforcing the Luxembourg law dated 19 December 2002 concerning the trade and
companies register and the accounting and annual accounts of undertakings (the

below), each as reflected in the Luxembourg Hedging Guarantor’s most recent financial
statements available to the Agent as at the date of this Agreement; or

(ii) 95 per cent. of the Luxembourg Hedging Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres), as
referred to in the Regulation as increased by the amount of Subordinated Debt (as
defined below), each as reflected in the Luxembourg Hedging Guarantor’s most recent
financial statements available to the Agent at the time the guarantee is called.

(b) For the purposes of this Schedule 7, Subordinated Debt means the Luxembourg Hedging
Guarantor’s debt which is subordinated in right of payment (whether generally or
specifically) to any claim of any Hedge Counterparty under the Hedging Agreements.

(c) The above limitation shall not apply to any amounts borrowed by, or made available to, in
any form whatsoever, the Luxembourg Hedging Guarantor or any of its direct or indirect
present or future Subsidiaries under any Hedging Agreement.

(d) For the purpose of this Schedule 7, the aggregate amount payable a Luxembourg Hedging
Guarantor, in its capacity as a guarantor, shall not include any obligation which, if incurred
would constitute a misuse of corporate assets as defined in article 171-1 of the Luxembourg
act dated 10 August 1915 concerning commercial companies, as amended (the
**_Companies Act 1915) or, without prejudice to sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 11 (Guarantee_**
_Limitations: General) above, a breach of the provisions of financial assistance as referred to_
in article 49-6 of the Companies Act 1915.

**14. Additional Guarantee Limitations**

The guarantee of any acceding Debtor which is a Hedging Guarantor (an “Acceding Hedging
**Guarantor”) is subject to any limitations relating to that Acceding Hedging Guarantor on the**
amount guaranteed or to the extent of the recourse of the beneficiaries of the guarantee which
is set out in the Debtor/Third Party Security Provider Accession Undertaking applicable to such
Acceding Hedging Guarantor and agreed with the Security Agent (acting reasonably in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles).

(c) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of
any rights of the Cash Management Facility Creditors under the Cash Management Facility
Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection

Security Agent or as the Security Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause 16
(Application of Proceeds).

ceases to be a Cash Management Facility Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Cash
Management Facility Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that
Retiring Cash Management Facility Guarantor or any of its Holding Companies then on the date
such Retiring Cash Management Facility Guarantor ceases to be a Cash Management Facility
Guarantor:

(a) that Retiring Cash Management Facility Guarantor is released by each other Cash
Management Facility Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and
whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Cash Management
Facility Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Cash Management
Facility Guarantor of its obligations under the Cash Management Facility Finance Documents;
and

(b) each other Cash Management Facility Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of
the performance of its obligations under the Cash Management Facility Finance Documents
to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of
any rights of the Cash Management Facility Creditors under any Cash Management Facility
Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any
Cash Management Facility Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or
in relation to the assets of the Retiring Cash Management Facility Guarantor.

any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Cash Management Facility
Creditor.

**11. Guarantee Limitations: General**

(a) The guarantee contained in this Schedule 8 does not apply to any liability to the extent that
it would result in this guarantee constituting unlawful financial assistance within the

Management Facility Guarantor and, with respect to any additional Cash Management

such additional Cash Management Facility Guarantor.

(b) If, notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, the obligations being guaranteed under this
Schedule 8 (the “Guarantee Obligations”) or Transaction Security would be unlawful

obligations under the Cash Management Facility Finance Documents will be deemed to have
been split into two tranches; “Tranche 1” comprising those obligations which may be secured

Commercial Code or any replacement law or regulation having the same effect, as
interpreted by French courts.

(b) In any case, the obligations and liabilities incurred by any French Cash Management Facility

(ii) all Indebtedness borrowed or incurred under intra-group loans, bonds or advances or
any similar arrangements made available directly or indirectly to that French Cash

indirectly with the proceeds of Indebtedness of Non Subsidiary Guaranteed Obligors

Guarantor under or in connection with this Schedule 8 insofar as required to guarantee the
payment obligations of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, will not in relation to any amount
due under or in connection with this Schedule 8, be limited and will therefore include all
amounts due by such Subsidiaries under the Finance Documents.

(g) It is acknowledged that any payment made by a French Cash Management Facility Guarantor
(other than any French Cash Management Facility Guarantor that is a Holding Company of
the Company) under this Schedule 8 or of the Intra-Group Debt shall reduce the maximum
amount of its guarantee under this Schedule 8.

**13. Luxembourg Guarantee Limitations**

(e) The maximum liability of any Luxembourg Cash Management Facility Guarantor under the
guarantee set out in this Schedule 8 together with any similar guarantee or indemnity
obligation of the Luxembourg Cash Management Facility Guarantor under or in connection
