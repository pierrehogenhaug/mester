**Forward-looking statements**

Various statements contained in this Offering Memorandum constitute “forward- looking statements.” All
statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Offering Memorandum, including, without
limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, strategy, anticipated investments, costs and results
(including growth prospects in particular countries), plans, projects to enhance efficiency, impact of
governmental regulations or actions, litigation outcomes and timetables, future capital expenditures, liquidity
requirements, the successful integration of acquisitions and joint ventures into our group, and objectives of
management for future operations, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. When used in this
Offering Memorandum, the words “believe,” “anticipate,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “expect,”
“estimates,” “positioned,” “strategy” and similar expressions identify these forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause
our actual results, performance or achievements or industry results to be materially different from those
contemplated, projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted, whether expressed or implied, by these
forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section of this Offering Memorandum
captioned “Risk Factors” beginning on page 41, which include, among others:

- price regulation that may be affected by efforts to reduce government spending on healthcare;

- continued weakness in economic conditions;

- our corporate structure and manner in which we exercise control over the operations of certain of our
French subsidiaries due to regulatory constraints;

- legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities;

- the dependence of our Central Lab business on the pharmaceutical industry;

- failure to establish and comply with appropriate quality standards in the provision of our testing services;

- the execution of our growth strategy through the acquisition of other businesses;

- our ability to integrate acquired businesses and realize planned synergy benefits (including, without
limitation, Novescia following the Acquisition);

- uncertainty with respect to the amount and the timeframe for synergies and other benefits expected to be
realized from the Acquisition;

- our dependence on our senior management team;

- difficulty in recruiting specialized clinical pathologists;

- the competitive environment in which we operate;

- the internalization of testing by hospitals and regional laboratory hubs, as well as the development of new,
more cost-effective tests that can be directly performed by the customers of our Specialized Testing
business;

- failures of our information technology systems;

- failure to timely or accurately bill for our services;

- financial difficulties of our clients or third-party payers requiring us to write off bad debts;

- the volatile nature of our Central Lab backlog;

- failure to comply with and liabilities arising under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations;

- disruption, failure or unsuitable delivery of sample transportation services;

- our dependence on our facility in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France;

ix


-----

- failure to comply with privacy laws and information security policies;

- our exposure to risks related to litigation;

- our exposure to liabilities not covered by our insurance policies;

- labor disruptions and negotiation of collective bargaining agreements;

- our reliance on the operating companies of our group, some of which we do not control, for revenues to
make payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees;

- our significant leverage, which may make it difficult to operate our businesses;

- the covenants contained in the Indentures and our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which limit our
operating and financial flexibility; and

- fluctuations in interest rates.

The risks included here are not exhaustive. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing
environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk
factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties,
investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum to
reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in factors affecting these statements.

This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy estimates, among others, relating to cost reductions and
other benefits expected to arise from the Acquisition as well as related costs to implement the Acquisition. The
estimates present the expected future impact of this transaction and the integration of Novescia into our existing
business. Such estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to
us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the synergies
arising from the Acquisition are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,
economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in the synergy benefit estimates.

**Presentation of financial and other information**

**Presentation of financial information**

The Company (formerly named Financière Gaillon 12) was incorporated on June 8, 2010 and acquired the
Original Company (then named Cerba European Lab) on July 21, 2010. On June 27, 2012, the Original
Company was merged into the Company. Subsequently, on July 2, 2012, the Company changed its legal name
from Financière Gaillon 12 to Cerba European Lab.

The Senior Notes Issuer was incorporated on August 8, 2008 in Luxembourg as a société à résponsabilité
_limitée and changed its corporate form to a société anonyme on January 26, 2015. The Senior Notes Issuer is a_
holding company which indirectly holds all of the shares of the Company. The Senior Notes Issuer and the
intermediate holding companies of the Company (Luxco and Holdco) do not engage in any activities other than
those relating to holding the shares of their subsidiaries. The only assets of the Senior Notes Issuer, Luxco and
Holdco are the shares in their subsidiaries, Luxco, Holdco and the Company, respectively, and debt instruments
issued by such subsidiaries, and de minimis cash. The most recent available financial statements of the Senior
Notes Issuer are for December 31, 2013. Future financial reports will be prepared at the level of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer. Other than the Senior Notes to be issued in connection with the Acquisition, the only
liabilities of the Senior Notes Issuer are the Frenchco CPECs and de minimis trade payables, taxes payable and
provisions for taxes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Frenchco CPECs” and “Capitalization”. The only
liabilities of Luxco and Holdco are debt owed to their direct parent entities and de minimis trade payables, taxes
payable and provisions for taxes. The Senior Notes Issuer has historically experienced losses (e.g., €14.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2013 under Luxembourg GAAP) on an unconsolidated basis relating to the
non-cash payment of interest due on the Frenchco CPECs. As € 397.1 million of the Frenchco CPECs were
converted into equity of the Senior Notes Issuer, we expect that these losses will not continue in the same
magnitude for future periods. In addition, on an unconsolidated basis, Luxco and Holdco have also historically
experienced losses (e.g., for the year ended December 31, 2013, Luxco experienced a net loss of € 0.2 million
under Luxembourg GAAP and Holdco experienced a net loss of €1.0 million under French GAAP).

The Temporary Senior Secured Notes Issuer was incorporated on April 18, 2014 and the Temporary Senior
Notes Issuer was incorporated on December 3, 2014. There is no financial information regarding the Temporary
Notes Issuers presented in this Offering Memorandum, as the Temporary Notes Issuers do not conduct any
operations or hold any assets other than their respective interests in the Escrow Accounts and, pursuant to the
Temporary Indentures, will undertake not to undertake in any activities unrelated to the transactions described in
this Offering Memorandum.

This Offering Memorandum includes the following financial information:

- the English translation of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries
as of, and for the period from July 15, 2010 through December 31, 2011, prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”), originally issued
in French (the “Company’s 2011 IFRS Financial Statements”);

- the unaudited consolidated income statement and cash flow statement of the Company for the twelve month
period ended December 31, 2011 extracted from the Company’s 2011 IFRS Financial Statements as
adjusted for (i) the reclassification of CVAE under income tax rather than as an operating expense and
(ii) some changes in presentation and reclassifications relating to financial instruments (the “Company’s
2011 Unaudited Financial Information”). This restatement, completed in accordance with IAS 8, can be
found in the Company’s 2012 IFRS Financial Statements;

- the English translation of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries
as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2012, prepared in accordance with IFRS, originally issued in
French (the “Company’s 2012 IFRS Financial Statements”);

- the English translation of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries
as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2013, prepared in accordance with IFRS, originally issued in
French (the “Company’s 2013 IFRS Financial Statements”);

- the English translation of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries as of, and for the nine months ended, September 30, 2014, prepared in accordance with IAS34
under IFRS (the “Company’s Q3 2014 IFRS Financial Statements”);

- the English translation of the audited consolidated financial statements of Novescia and its subsidiaries as
of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2013, prepared in accordance with IFRS, originally issued in
French (the “Novescia’s 2013 IFRS Financial Statements”);

- the English translation of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Novescia and its
subsidiaries as of, and for the nine months ended, September 30, 2014 prepared in accordance with the
measurement and recognition principles described in the notes thereto, originally issued in French
(“Novescia’s Q3 2014 Financial Statements”); and

- the financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2013,
prepared in accordance with Luxembourg GAAP, incorporated herein by reference.

Novescia’s Q3 2014 Financial Statements have not been prepared in accordance with IAS34 under IFRS and do
not include comparative information for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and certain footnotes
required by IAS 34. In addition, we have not provided a discussion of the results of operations of Novescia for
any period in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Pro forma financial information_**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited combined pro forma financial information for the
year ended December 31, 2013, for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and the twelve months ended
September 30, 2014, in each case adjusted to give effect to (i) the acquisitions completed during the period from
January 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2013, (ii) the Novescia
Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2013 and (iii) certain non-recurring items during the period
(collectively, the “Pro Forma Financial Information”). The unaudited pro forma financial information has been
prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual results would have been had
(i) and (ii), above, occurred on January 1, 2013 nor does it purport to project our results of operation at any
future date. The Company’s Pro Forma Financial Information included in this Offering Memorandum has not
been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934 or U.S. GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information have been
audited in accordance with French GAAS, ISA or U.S. GAAS. In evaluating the pro forma financial
information, you should carefully consider our audited historical consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The Pro Forma Financial Information is based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are
reasonable but are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have actually been achieved if the
acquisitions had been completed on the dates indicated, or indicative of the results that may be achieved in the
future. The Pro Forma Financial Information is provided for information purposes only. See “Unaudited Pro
_Forma Consolidated Financial Information.”_

The Pro Forma Financial Information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 is based in part on the
unaudited financial information of Novescia for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, which is not
included in this Offering Memorandum, was not prepared in accordance with IAS34 under IFRS and represent
Novescia’s internal management accounts.

Although the Pro Forma Financial Information includes certain adjustments to reflect the full-period impact of
acquisitions and disposals by the Company and its subsidiaries since January 1, 2013 and to eliminate the
transaction costs associated with such transactions, similar adjustments for acquisitions and disposals and the
related transaction costs by Novescia are not included herein. In particular, Novescia disposed of Novescia
Aquitane and Novescia Côte d’Azur in February 2013 and on January 30, 2014, respectively. Novescia
Aquitaine’s net sales contributions to Novescia for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013
were €4.0 million and €0.4 million, respectively, and its profit from recurring operations before amortization
and depreciation contributions to Novescia for the same periods were €0.6 million and €0.1 million,
respectively. Novescia Côte d’Azur’s net sales contributions to Novescia for the years ended December 31,
2012 and December 31, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were €12.3 million, €11.8 million
and €1.0 million, respectively, and its profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation
contributions to Novescia for the same periods were € 0.8 million, €0.4 million and €0.3 million, respectively. In
addition, the Pro Forma Financial Information does not make adjustments for intercompany sales between the
Company and its subsidiaries and Novescia. This, however, has no impact on profit from recurring operations
before amortization and depreciation as the excess sales are eliminated in consumption of materials and
supplies.

**Non-IFRS financial measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
_Pro Forma EBITDA, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA (including Novescia_
synergies) and certain coverage ratios that are not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. Such
measures and ratios may not reflect accurately our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur debt and should
not be considered as alternatives to operating income or net profit or any other performance measures derived
from or in accordance with IFRS, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as
alternatives to cash flow from operating activities. The financial information contained in this Offering
Memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to
review by the SEC. As used in this Offering Memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings:

EBITDA for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 represents operating income plus the
income statement line items for net change in depreciation, amortization and impairment. We present EBITDA
including profit (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted with items, either positive or negative, some of which our
management considers to be non-recurring in nature as well as certain non-cash items that management does not
consider to be representative of the underlying performance of the business, including:

- expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions completed during the period (advisory fees and other one
off items) and restructurings, as well as all costs, fees and other expenses incurred in connection with share
capital increases or new indebtedness;

- the full year impact of cost savings initiatives that have been implemented or decided in the course of the
period;

- other non-cash items such as movement in pension and other provisions; and

- certain accounting adjustments.

_Pro Forma EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted with the full period effect of the EBITDA of (i) companies_
acquired during the period from January 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014 as if they had occurred on
January 1, 2013, (ii) the Novescia Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2013 and (iii) certain
non-recurring items during the period. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information, Pro
_Forma and Other Data—Other Financial, Pro Forma and Operating Data” and “Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Consolidated Financial Information.”_

Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA represents Pro Forma EBITDA adjusted with items, either positive or negative,
some of which our management considers to be non-recurring in nature as well as certain non-cash items that
management does not consider to be representative of the underlying performance of the business, including:

- expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions completed during the period (advisory fees and other one
off items) and restructurings, as well as all costs, fees and other expenses incurred in connection with share
capital increases or new indebtedness;

- the full year impact of cost savings initiatives that have been implemented or decided in the course of the
period;

- other non-cash items such as movement in pension and other provisions; and

- certain accounting adjustments.

Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA (including Novescia synergies) represents Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA
adjusted to include the full year impact of cost synergies expected to be achieved as a result of the Acquisition.

This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy estimates, among others, relating to cost reductions and
other benefits expected to arise from the Acquisition as well as related costs to implement the Acquisition. The
estimates present the expected future impact of this transaction and the integration of Novescia into our existing
business. Such estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to
us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the synergies
arising from the Acquisition are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,

xiii


-----

economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in the synergy benefit estimates.

We present Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma
EBITDA (including Novescia synergies) for informational purposes only. This information does not represent
the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions or other transactions for which an adjustment is
made occurred at the dates indicated. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as
non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations
for Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA
(including Novescia synergies) are based on various assumptions (including the successful implementation of
certain initiatives), management estimates and the unaudited management accounts of the acquired businesses.
These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent
accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or
complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired businesses or other
transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the
other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making
an investment decision.

We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted
_Pro Forma EBITDA (including Novescia synergies) because we believe they are helpful to investors as_
measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. These measures are not measurements of
financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our
operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.
EBITDA and its variants as presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from similarly titled measures
used by other companies and from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in the sections entitled “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes “and “Description of the Senior Notes” of this Offering Memorandum and in the_
Indentures or the Temporary Indentures. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
EBITDA, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA (including Novescia synergies) to
net operating income (loss), see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information, Pro Forma and
_Other Data—Other Financial, Pro Forma and Operating Data” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated_
_Financial Information.”_

The non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures of other companies; have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation
or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of each of
these non-IFRS measures are:

- they do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;

- they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments, on indebtedness;

- they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA,
Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA (including Novescia synergies) do not
reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and

- other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
_Pro Forma EBITDA, and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA differently than as presented in this Offering_
Memorandum, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA,
Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA (including Novescia synergies) and the related ratios presented throughout this
Offering Memorandum should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in
business growth or reduce indebtedness.

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or
thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result,
the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data
set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are
calculated using the numerical data in our consolidated financial statements or the tabular presentation of other
data (subject to rounding) contained in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical
data in the narrative description thereof.

**Industry and market information**

Unless otherwise expressly indicated or noted below, all information regarding markets, market size, market
share, market position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to our business contained in this Offering
Memorandum are based on estimates prepared by us based on certain assumptions and our knowledge of the
industry in which we operate, as well as data from various market research publications, publicly available
information and industry publications, including reports published by various third-party sources. Industry
publications generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be
reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have not
independently verified such data. We use a combination of data provided by Les comptes de la sécurité sociale,
the Comptes nationaux de la santé 2013 and the Rapport de la Cour des Comptes for the French market, INAMI
for the Belgian market and other industry sources.

In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, government
bodies or other organizations) to validate market related analysis and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own
internally developed estimates regarding the industry in which we operate, our position in the industry, our
market share and the market shares of various industry participants based on experience, our own investigation
of market conditions and our review of industry publications, including information made available to the public
by our competitors. While we have examined and relied upon certain market or other industry data from
external sources as the basis for its estimates, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have verified that data
independently. We and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you of the accuracy and completeness of, and take
no responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while we believe our internal estimates to be reasonable, these
estimates have not been verified by any independent source and we and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you
as to their accuracy. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various
factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”

**Our company**

We are a leading European clinical pathology laboratory, providing routine and specialized clinical laboratory
testing services primarily in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, and supporting pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies worldwide in the clinical trial phase of their drug development processes.

Through our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations, we offer a range of over 2,500 routine and
specialty clinical tests used by doctors and medical institutions to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases. We
generally perform clinical tests using automated testing equipment, quickly delivering results to doctors,
hospitals and patients and offering specialized assistance with respect to interpretation of results. Through a
large network of high quality laboratories in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, our Routine Lab operations
perform a wide variety of clinical tests (including blood chemistry analyses, urinalyses, blood cell counts and
microbiology cultures and procedures) for patients who have generally been prescribed these tests by their
doctors. Our Specialized Testing operations offer private laboratories and public hospitals a broad range of
specialty testing services, such as molecular biology testing, oncology testing, allergy testing, hormonology
testing, infectious disease testing and diagnostic genetic testing. While French private laboratories and public
hospitals represent the largest share of our Specialized Testing customer base (90.9% of our Specialized Testing
net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2014), we also offer our services to hospitals or laboratories
based elsewhere in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The prices of a large majority of the clinical tests
that we offer in our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses are set by the respective government
authorities of the countries in which we operate.

Our Central Lab testing operations, which we operate through our BARC subsidiaries, provide safety and
efficacy testing services to pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations worldwide in
connection with drug development processes. We leverage our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing facilities
and expertise to develop testing protocols with our clients and to provide a range of safety, efficacy,
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic testing.

As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately 2,617 full-time equivalent employees and we employed
approximately 221 clinical pathologists. Over the course of our history, we have developed our business through
strategic acquisitions of regional laboratories, such as our acquisitions of JS Bio, Biotop, Biolille and
Bioréunion, as well as through selective purchases of larger testing platforms for access to new markets, such as
our acquisitions of LLAM in Luxembourg in 2011 and BARC in Belgium in 2007.

On December 19, 2014, we signed the Securities Purchase Agreement under which we will acquire directly
and/or indirectly all of the Target Group securities subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent. See
“The Acquisition.”

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated pro forma net sales of €575.2 million (our
Specialized Testing business accounted for €138.3 million, our Routine Lab business accounted for
€405.9 million, our Central Lab business accounted for €46.7 million and intercompany sales accounted for
negative €15.7 million) and Adjusted pro forma EBITDA (including Novescia synergies) of €136.8 million. See
“Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information, Pro Forma and Other Data—Other Financial, Pro
_Forma and Operating Data.”_

**Our competitive strengths**

Our business benefits from a number of competitive strengths, including:

1


-----

**_Integrated, efficient and diversified business model_**

We operate an integrated, efficient and diversified business model based on strong and recognized medical
expertise, as well as proven industrial and organizational know-how. Our reputation for scientific excellence,
inherited from our historical specialty business founded in 1967 in France as well as our Central Lab business
founded in 1985 in Belgium benefits the entire organization through cross-selling, cost synergies, training,
technical support and sharing of best practices, as well as quicker and easier access to technology and to
top-trained clinical pathologists. We believe our reputation for scientific excellence is particularly valuable to
our Specialized Testing and Central Lab businesses and is a significant strength as we look to continue taking
part in the consolidation of the routine lab market. Our reputation boosts our credibility as a market
consolidator. Through its link with the medical and pharmaceutical communities, our Central Lab business
provides us with insights into new clinical pathology tests being developed in the industry. The strong medical
expertise of our group and its exposure to rare pathologies also help attract and retain the best clinical
pathologists. We believe our Central Lab business leverages our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing
infrastructure, equipment and clinical pathologists to perform safe and cost-effective testing of new drugs,
thereby generating significant cost synergies.

Our business model also benefits from our strong experience in managing large-scale technical and logistical
networks, which allows us not only to expand organically and geographically our different businesses, but also
to optimize internal synergies between them. In particular, our strong logistics expertise, based on outsourced
operations managed by in-house experts, allows us to optimize our size and organization in a cost—and
operationally effective way.

Our presence across all segments of the industry also allows us to benefit from the entire life cycle of a test,
from its early and confidential use, as part of a drug trial in Central Lab, to its more common use in Specialized
Testing through to its massive dissemination as a routine test. Finally, our integrated business model has
allowed us to better absorb pricing pressures and improve profitability by negotiating more advantageous
purchasing conditions with our reagent and equipment suppliers. We regularly invest in the latest technological
advances in our field and are able to attract and retain leading clinical pathologists.

**_Leading market positions across routine, specialty and central lab testing_**

We are the only clinical pathology laboratory in Europe with leading market positions in all its geographies and
across all three segments of the clinical laboratory services industry based on revenue. Following the
Acquisition, we believe that we will be the largest private network of clinical pathology laboratories in France
and one of the top four private players in Europe by net sales, based on management estimates. We also believe
that, based on management estimates for 2014, we were among the three largest private providers of routine
testing in Belgium and among the three largest private ambulatory care routine laboratories in Luxembourg. In
Specialized Testing, our historical core business, we believe that we were co-leader of the market in France
based on management estimates for 2014, with customers in more than 50 countries across Europe, the Middle
East and North Africa. Finally, we believe we are a significant player in the Central Lab market worldwide,
based on management estimates for 2014. Our position as market leader in the three segments in which we
operate enables us to attract the best clinical pathologists and to be at the forefront of both technological and
medical advancements in the clinical pathology industry as a result of our privileged relationships with the
medical and scientific communities. Our position as a leader has made us a key player in the consolidation of
the routine market.

We believe we offer one of the largest catalogs of clinical tests in Europe, with over 2,500 tests as of
December 31, 2014, of which approximately 1,500 are highly specialized in molecular clinical pathology,
immunology, cellular clinical pathology, bacteriology, hormonology, oncology and rare biochemistry. As of
September 30, 2014, we employed approximately 221 clinical pathologists who perform and interpret clinical
tests processed on our technical platforms and assist external clinical pathologists and doctors in their
diagnostics.

**_Resilient and growing market underpinned by strong fundamentals and further growth opportunities_**

The European clinical laboratory services market has been characterized by resilient growth over the past
several years, including through economic downturns, benefiting from favorable demographic and scientific
trends. The private clinical laboratory testing markets in France and Luxembourg experienced compound annual
growth from 2008 to 2011 of approximately 1.8% and 4.9%, respectively, while the total clinical laboratory
testing market in Belgium experienced compound annual growth of approximately 3.4% for the same period.

2


-----

Past growth of the routine and specialty testing markets has been supported by strong demographic trends in our
geographical markets. Contrary to certain other European countries, the population in France, our main market,
continues to grow. In the meantime, as life expectancy continues to increase in Europe generally, the number of
people aged 60 and over (an age at which people request and need more medical treatments) increases too. In
addition, as birth rates remain relatively high in our markets, particularly in France, pregnant women also
generate a significant volume of medical testing.

Public health and scientific trends have also been key drivers of the growth of the routine and specialty testing
markets. As it is less expensive to prevent a disease than to treat it, governments have pursued policies that favor
preventive care, in addition to encouraging more accurate and sophisticated tests to facilitate early detection. We
believe, based on publicly available information, that from 2012 to 2025, the percentage of overall healthcare
expenditure worldwide dedicated to diagnosis, prediction and disease monitoring will increase from
approximately 40% to 65%. Finally, chronic diseases, which generally require regular testing for monitoring
purposes, have increased in recent years likely due to certain lifestyle trends, such as low levels of physical
activity, malnutrition, stress and pollution.

We believe that in addition to these demographic and public health fundamentals, other trends will lead to an
increase in the volume of medical testing, and thus support the future growth of our different markets. In
particular:

- we believe that new tests will emerge as technologies develop and personalization of prevention and
treatment will become the norm; we believe that the market will shift progressively to preventive care, early
detection and companion diagnostics;

- we also believe that the routine laboratory testing market in Europe will further consolidate, in particular in
France, which is still highly fragmented, with approximately 6.2 laboratories per 100,000 people in 2013, as
opposed to more consolidated markets such as in Germany, where there were approximately 0.7
laboratories per 100,000 people in 2011;

- state budget reductions, as well as regulatory liberalization, will further increase outsourcing of routine and
specialized tests from the public sector; in 2013, revenue from French clinical pathology laboratory testing
totaled approximately €4.3 billion, with private laboratories representing approximately 60% of the overall
French clinical laboratory testing market; and

- with respect to the central lab market, we believe that the necessity of the pharmaceutical industry to market
new drugs to replace aging blockbusters, as well as the further externalization of pharmaceutical
companies’ R&D capabilities, will increase demand for central lab testing.

**_Significant barriers to entry_**

The European testing markets in which we operate are characterized by regulatory and structural specificities
which make them more difficult and costly to penetrate for potential new entrants. We believe that scientific
reputation, technical capabilities, market and regulatory knowledge, as well as critical size, all of which are
characteristics of the Cerba group, are key elements that will be necessary to fully benefit from future growth
opportunities.

We believe our group is well known for scientific excellence and cutting- edge technical know-how. Inherited
from our historical core specialty lab business founded in 1967 in France and our central lab business founded in
1985 in Belgium, this reputation, which has allowed us to establish a renowned brand name in the medical
laboratory testing industry, constitutes an invaluable strength vis-à-vis potential new entrants, in particular in
central lab where referral processes are long and difficult.

We operate in a highly regulated market with stringent regulations and strict accreditation procedures governing
the granting or the renewal of a license to operate a laboratory. Securing these mandatory accreditations entails
significant investment and lengthy and complex processes making it increasingly difficult for new entrants to
penetrate the market. For example, the existing administrative authorization process for the establishment and
operation of clinical laboratories in France will be replaced in November 2020 by a new accreditation procedure
that will introduce new, stricter requirements pursuant to the ISO standard (the new accreditation system will be
gradually implemented with two steps in November 2016, when 50% of the tests performed by a laboratory will
have to be accredited, and November 2018, when 70% of the tests performed by a laboratory will have to be
accredited). Non-accredited clinical laboratories were required to demonstrate that they had effectively begun

3


-----

the new accreditation process by November 2013. This new accreditation process is costly and time-consuming.
As such, it will constitute a significant barrier to entry for new entrants and a significant burden for existing
small labs. Further, the legal constraints in the French market regarding mandatory shareholding of clinical
pathologists with which we believe we already comply, constitute a significant barrier to entry into the French
routine market. The stringent price regulations applicable to the routine and specialty markets in which we
operate also constitute serious obstacles for new entrants as these price constraints favor well-established and
large players who benefit from their existing reputation and large scale to implement a cost effective model.
Finally, we believe that in France, new networks would be difficult to create as the opening of new laboratories
or collection points requires several regulatory approvals, which are only rarely obtained as the market already
includes too many laboratories.

We also believe that size and scale, which would be highly difficult and costly to achieve in the short term for
any new entrant, are key strengths for larger market participants like us. We believe that larger participants, with
well-established and integrated logistical capabilities, are better equipped and positioned to treat high volume
testing in a more cost effective way, to consolidate the routine market where necessary, to secure loyalty from
outsourcing (for specialty lab) and commercial (for central lab) partners, to optimize synergies within the
different testing businesses and, finally, to seize growth opportunities in new geographical markets.

Finally, we believe that the logistics organization of our Specialized Testing business is a valuable asset that
would be difficult for new entrants to replicate. For cost and operational efficiency, we have outsourced the
operation of our logistics network to a trusted partner. Our partner, who is ISO accredited, is in charge of the
collection and transportation of samples. While we have outsourced this aspect of the logistics for our
Specialized Testing Business, we maintain in-house the management and proprietary mapping of the network.
This model, as well as our strong in-house logistics expertise and experience, allow us to collect an average of
approximately 13,000 samples per day, from more than 3,000 locations worldwide, and to ensure that all tubes
arrive before 7 a.m. in our specialty laboratory in Saint-Ouen- l’Aumône, near Paris, France, to be tested within
24 hours.

**_Proven consolidation strategy with a structured approach to acquisitions_**

Founded as a specialty laboratory in 1967, we have since then expanded into new businesses and new
geographies through acquisitions. With our acquisition of BARC in 2007, we expanded into the central
laboratory testing business as well as the routine laboratory testing business in Belgium. We have continued to
expand our Routine Lab business through a handful of strategic acquisitions in highly populated geographic
areas of France (such as Biolille in the Lille metropolitan area in 2009, CBCV in the Paris area in 2010, Biotop
in the Marseille area in 2010 and JS Bio in the Provence–Alpes–Côte d’Azur area in 2014), and Luxembourg
(such as Ketterthill Laboratories, which we acquired through our acquisition of LLAM in 2011), complemented
by a series of bolt-on acquisitions. While such strategic acquisitions are more complex and less frequent, they
enable us to expand into new geographic zones or into new segments. The laboratories we acquire through these
strategic acquisitions often serve as technical platforms regional clusters and perform the entire clinical
laboratory testing for the region. We complement these strategic acquisitions with a number of small bolt-on
acquisitions of laboratories that we transform into collection points where samples are collected from patients
and sent to the technical platforms for testing. Through this regional clusterization strategy built around
technical platforms, we have built a very dense network of laboratories centered around eight regional clusters
in France, three in Belgium and one in Luxembourg. From a single laboratory site in 2007, we have grown to
operate approximately 248 sites with a staff of approximately 221 clinical pathologists as of September 30,
2014. In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014,
we completed 21, 8, 6 and 1 acquisition(s), respectively, of which respectively 18, 7, 4 and 0 were bolt-on
acquisitions.

Significant portions of the European clinical laboratory services market, especially the French market, remain
highly fragmented. These markets present opportunities for consolidation and growth.

In addition, certain regulatory changes, such as the introduction of mandatory accreditation and higher-quality
standards in France, generally benefit larger laboratory companies or networks like ours. Since 2007, we have
been an active consolidator in the routine lab market, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on
additional opportunities in France as well as in potential new markets. We have a dedicated team of four people
focused on finding, evaluating and executing external growth opportunities and have developed a structured
approach to acquisitions that capitalizes on the expertise and market knowledge of our senior management and
local laboratory doctors. The laboratory companies we acquire are often clients or competitors of ours with
whom we have had prior business interaction. This in-depth knowledge of the industry helps us pre-select

4


-----

suitable acquisition targets. We have a disciplined approach to acquisitions, including the setting of internal
acquisition multiple targets and high due diligence standards, which include the participation of the senior
executives at the various stages of the acquisition process. While we typically focus on the bolt-on acquisitions
of small and medium sized laboratory companies with revenues in the range of approximately €1 million to
€10 million with the aim of consolidating our regional network around existing technical platforms, we have
also selectively acquired large regional clusters of laboratories in the past, such as BARC, LLAM and JS Bio to
establish our footprint in new geographical markets or to enter into new industries. We believe that the
fragmentation of the French clinical laboratory market, together with the general economic slowdown, allows us
to complete acquisitions of clinical laboratories at attractive prices.

Post-acquisition, we generally implement cost reduction initiatives aimed at increasing the profitability of the
clinical laboratories we acquire through economies of scale and the sharing of best practices with the rest of the
network. Certain synergies from bolt-on acquisitions can be realized upon closing of the acquisition such as
savings on reagent costs. We also achieve reductions in technical and administrative expenses as we shift
technical and administrative functions to our technical platforms. We also achieve savings by redeploying the
personnel of the acquired entity across our network in the technical platform, which can be a lengthier process
taking more than 24 months after acquisition in certain cases. However, due to voluntary departures resulting
from the redeployment process of our workforce to our regional platforms, some cost reductions relating to
personnel can be quickly realized.

**_Track record of a strong and sustained financial performance, with high margin and strong cash flow_**
**_generation_**

We have demonstrated sustained net sales compound annual growth of 17.4% between the year ended
December 31, 2009 reported at the Original Company level and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 at
the Company level, adjusted for the pro forma effect of acquisitions realized during the course of the twelve
months ended September 30, 2014. This sales growth has been underpinned by our acquisition strategy as we
have sought to increase our market share in the Routine Lab testing market.

The Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2011 and for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2014 increased from 21.5% to 22.9%, demonstrating our ability to rapidly
integrate acquired companies, realize synergies and gain greater operating leverage through our increased scale.
With the strong support of our main shareholders, we have developed and are implementing numerous cost
initiatives that allow us to further control our costs by optimizing our relationships with our suppliers, our
logistics operations and our information technology systems. This disciplined investment and cost control
strategy has allowed us to achieve a significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA margins over the years.

Finally, our business requires relatively low capital expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and working capital
requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended September 30,
2014, our net capital expenditures (excluding asset acquisitions), were €8.7 million, €9.9 million, €8.9 million
and €5.2 million, respectively. As a percentage of our net sales, capital expenditure (excluding asset
acquisitions) amounted to 3.1%, 3.0%, 2.5% and 1.7% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013
and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. Due to this favorable business model, we were
able to generate strong cash flow as reflected by our cash conversion rate of 85% for 2011, 86% for 2012, 89%
for 2013 and 93% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (cash conversion rate, expressed as a
percentage, is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditure (excluding asset acquisitions), divided by
Adjusted EBITDA).

**_Well regarded and experienced management team at group level and unique governance and ownership_**
**_structure at operational level_**

We benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our current senior management team. In particular,
Catherine Rondot-Courboillet, our CEO and a highly regarded industry specialist in Europe, Jérôme Thill, our
CFO, Sylvie Cado, head of our Specialized Testing business, Alain Niederhoffer, our director of logistics and
purchasing, Philippe Buhl, head of our Routine Labs in France and Cyril Dubreuil, our sales director in France,
each of whom has more than nine years of experience in the industry with an average of 22 years’ industry
experience and an average of 16 years’ experience in the group.

Moreover, our ownership model is based on a strong entrepreneurial culture, where more than 100 laboratory
doctors and managers are shareholders of our structure, at our holding company level and at the different
operating laboratories levels. Our ownership model and structure gives us overall strategic control, while also

incentivizing doctors and managers to fully contribute to a common commercial, scientific and industrial project
and greatly rewarding commitment, development and innovation. We believe that our ownership structure is key
to the strength and success of our model as a whole.

Finally, the support and investment experience of our controlling shareholder, PAI, supplements the leadership
and knowledge of our senior management and laboratory doctors.

**Our strategy**

Based in particular on our strong scientific reputation and expertise, our strategy mainly consists of becoming a
leading network in the French routine lab market through consolidation, while maintaining our unique
positioning in the European specialty and central lab businesses. The key elements of our strategy are:

**_Drive organic volume growth across our business segments_**

The core of our group’s strategy consists of developing organically each of our different business segments
through coordinated but tailored action plans.

In the Specialty Testing market, we are committed first to maintaining our leadership through the renewal of our
catalog of tests, the acceleration of compliance with new ISO regulations and the improvement of our logistics
services, in particular at the international level. We intend to particularly focus our efforts on profitable organic
growth driven mainly by new tests and, to a lesser degree, by the expansion of our international activity. As a
result, we aim to innovate through new technologies, new tests and enhanced services for customers through
partnerships with hospitals and biotech companies, and through the work of our scientific and medical
committee. We also aim to further expand our export activity, leveraging our reputation and logistics
capabilities to reach more customers, including in selective new geographical markets. Our focus on profitable
organic growth will also imply the further development of synergies between our Specialized Testing business
and our Central Lab activities, in particular through biomarkers innovations. Finally, we intend to foster the
general profitability of our Specialized Testing business, including through the further automation of our
processes (such as invoicing and samples encoding) and the better optimization of new regulations.

With respect to our Routine Lab business, our strategy will encompass operational and functional alignment
between our regional clusters, which is facilitated by the deployment of a dedicated team. These alignment
efforts will further include the standardization of our routine industrial processes with respect to technical
platform operations, quality assurance and information systems. The dedicated team in charge of this integration
strategy will also focus on improving the management of our routine staff and the organization of our networks.
Finally, our strategy with respect to the organic growth of our Routine Lab business includes the selection of
those of our youngest laboratory doctors with the most promising managerial capabilities; we will provide them
with high quality business school training, with the aim of further improving the management of our laboratories
at the local level.

Finally, we intend to develop our Central Lab business through the further differentiation of the positioning of
BARC. In particular, we believe we will be able to achieve strong organic growth of our Central Lab business
by broadening our product selection from safety to tailor-made biomarkers and leveraging our strong scientific
knowledge and capabilities as well as our proven specialist approach implemented by a unique team of clinical
pathologists, including through the co-development of new tests with clients. We also intend to develop our
Central Lab business by strengthening our leadership position in Europe and Africa, working to establish a
position in Asia, improving client services and adaptability including through price transparency and
competitiveness, strengthening our pure testing player approach (that is, our ability to intervene in all clinical
trial phases) and continuing our certification program and our tailor-made reporting approach. Finally, we intend
to strengthen our worldwide lab networks to capture new contracts and expand our customer base.

**_Selectively pursue acquisitions_**

In the French routine lab market, we are organized in eight regional clusters, which we intend to further expand.
In regions where we are already present, our expansion strategy will include selected small- and mid-size
bolt-on acquisitions that fit into and complement the existing local networks organized around technical
platforms. To expand into new regions, we intend either to pursue acquisitions of existing regional clusters
followed by further bolt-on acquisitions in line with our clusterization strategy, or to implement more significant
strategic transactions with larger players. Our strategic focus will be to pursue bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen
and increase the density of our regional network and local market share. As in the past, we expect bolt-on

acquisitions to generate immediate synergies by transforming the acquired small laboratories into collection
points that feed samples to a technical platform where test analysis is centralized. The strategic rationale of the
larger acquisition of Novescia is to create a new presence in the Rhône-Alpes region encompassing Lyon, the
second-largest city in France, which will allow us to gain broader geographical coverage in our core French
market and to strengthen our business with private hospitals, a significant source of business for Novescia. We
estimate that, as a result of the Acquisition, our consolidated business operations will achieve cost synergies of
approximately € 10 million on an annual run rate basis by mid-2016, primarily relating to the shifting of a
portion of the testing activities carried out by Novescia onto the Company’s platforms, the planned reduction of
administrative costs associated with Novescia’s headquarters and the realization of procurement synergies by
integrating and leveraging our combined scale. However, this synergy estimate is based on a number of
assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such
information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide
variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates. We are also considering more
significant, strategic and transformational combinations, as we believe that one or more of our major European
competitors, including Unilabs, Amedes and Labco (some of which may be larger than us), may be available for
acquisition on attractive terms over the near and intermediate term. We currently have reached no agreement
with respect to any such acquisition and are not in discussions with any of these potential targets.

In the past, we completed a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our geographical coverage and gain
critical mass in markets outside France. Although our acquisition strategy is currently focused on the French
routine market, we may explore opportunities to purchase larger laboratory networks in other European
countries. As such, our focus will be on the most densely populated regions as well as the regions with the
largest number of prescribers.

**_Continue to deliver operating efficiencies_**

We also intend to continue to take advantage of the economies of scale provided by our presence in all three
segments of the laboratory testing market and by the size of our network to streamline our operations and
administrative functions and to control costs. We are aiming in particular at controlling costs through the further
rationalization of our network (in particular in France by establishing technical platforms surrounded by a
sophisticated and condensed network of collection points), the further industrialization and automation of our
processes and the optimization of synergies between our segments and geographies. We also intend to further
leverage our size to obtain favorable commercial conditions from suppliers. In cooperation with our main
logistical partners, we will continue to improve our logistical organization and optimize samples collection and
transportation, seeking logistical synergies between our national and international activities and between our
three business segments. Finally, we will continue to work on the better integration of our laboratories, in
particular with respect to those acquired most recently. In particular, we will seek to optimize our operating
costs through the implementation of group agreements and processes with respect to IT, cars, rentals, external
fees and utilities.

(12) The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement permits the incurrence of up to €50 million of revolving credit borrowings on a committed
basis. In addition and in connection with the Acquisition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement permitted on the Completion Date a
one-time increase to the total commitments in an amount not exceeding €30.0 million, subject to certain conditions, and at all times the
commitments may be further increased to an amount which does not result in the total commitments under the Revolving Credit
Facility exceeding the lower of (i) 65% of Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
including Pro Forma EBITDA for acquisitions and taking into account cost savings derived therefrom) for the relevant period and
(ii) €200.0 million, subject to certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on January 31, 2019. The Company,
Biolille, Bioréunion, Biotop, CBCV, Cefid, Cerba Selafa and LLAM are borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility. The
obligations of the borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company and the
same Guarantors that guarantee the Senior Secured Notes and are secured by the same Senior Secured Notes Collateral as the Senior
Secured Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations that are permitted to be secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will have
priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Any proceeds
received upon any enforcement action over any Senior Secured Notes Collateral, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility have been repaid and such hedging obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in
repayment of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes and certain other Indebtedness of
the Company and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral on a pari passu basis
pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, including certain other
hedging obligations.

(13) Restrictions imposed on the ownership of such laboratory companies by French law limit (i) persons who are not clinical pathologists
and entities that are not laboratory companies from holding more than 25% of a laboratory company’s share capital and (ii) external
clinical pathologists and entities that are laboratory companies from holding more than 49% of the voting rights in a laboratory
company. We hold our French laboratory companies indirectly through Cefid. Cefid holds the statutory maximum of 25% of the share
capital of Cerba Selafa. However, the by-laws of Cerba Selafa grant Cefid 99.96% of the financial rights (i.e., the rights to receive
dividends). Cerba Selafa, as a laboratory company, holds approximately the statutory maximum of 49% of the voting rights in Biotop,
BioPyrénées Lab, Bioréunion, Biobaie, CBCV, CBM and Biopole 80, and 45.62% of the voting rights in Biolille. Cerba Selafa holds
between approximately 70% and 99.99% of the financial rights in each of Biotop, Biolille, BioPyrénées Lab, Bioréunion, Biobaie,
CBM, CBCV and Biopole 80. The clinical pathologists at each of our French laboratory subsidiary companies hold the remainder of
the voting rights and financial rights. For more information on our corporate structure and the limitations imposed by French law on
ownership of laboratory companies, see “Business—Our specific corporate structure” and “Regulation—France.”

(14) These entities are engaged in our Routine Lab business in France and correspond to each of our regional clusters. Each of these entities
may have subsidiaries from time to time that are not shown in this chart due to bolt-on acquisition activity. Any such subsidiaries are
generally merged into these entities following completion of such acquisitions.

(15) For companies set up after May 31, 2013, in France including CBM, law n° 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 requires that the ownership
of more than 50% of their share capital and voting rights must be held, directly or indirectly, by clinical pathologists and entities that
are laboratory companies. Laboratories set up prior to May 31, 2013 do not have to comply with this new requirement.

(16) Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, we expect that Cerba Selafa will own, directly or indirectly, approximately 99% of the
financial rights of the operating subsidiaries of Novescia SAS. We do not expect entities of Novescia to guarantee the Notes, or to
pledge collateral to secure, the Senior Secured Notes or the Revolving Credit Facility upon the consummation of the Acquisition
although, pursuant to the provisions of the Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility, they may be required to do so in the future.

(17) BARC’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries include BARC Finance (the share capital of which will be part of the Collateral and is owned
primarily by BARC, with the remaining 0.01% being held by the Company), BARC Australia, BARC China, BARC NV, BARC RSA
South Africa and BARC USA, which are all primarily engaged in our Central Lab line of business.

(18) Each of our Belgian and Luxembourg subsidiaries is wholly owned directly or indirectly by the Company.

(19) The business of JS Bio is now conducted through Biotop and its subsidiary SLB.

these limitations may apply to the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, but not

Facility. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—The Senior Secured
_Note Guarantees,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—The_

**Intercreditor Agreement** ............. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liens securing the Senior

that rank equally with the liens that secure (i) obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, (ii) certain other future debt permitted
to be incurred under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
(iii) certain obligations under certain hedging arrangements. Such liens will

Agreement. In the event of conflicting instructions, the Intercreditor
Agreement contains provisions requiring consultation and specifies which

set of instructions will prevail. See “Description of other indebtedness—

The Senior Notes Collateral also secures the Senior Secured Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility on a first-priority basis, is subject to standstill
provisions and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk
_factors—Risks related to our structure—The Senior Notes will be secured_
_only to the extent of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral that has been_
_granted as security for the Senior Notes and future secured debt may be_
_secured by certain assets that do not secure the Senior Notes,” and_
“Description of other indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the holders of the
Senior Notes will not be entitled to instruct the Security Agent to take any
enforcement action under the relevant Security Documents (or against any
guarantor of the Senior Notes) after the occurrence of a Senior Notes event
of default or any other event that would cause the Senior Notes to become
due and payable unless:

(a) the Secured Debt Discharge Date (under and as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement) has occurred;

enforcing the liens on the relevant Collateral at the instruction of the

Facility or certain hedging obligations; or

(c) the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement otherwise entitle
the holders of the Senior Notes to take enforcement action under the relevant
Security Documents.

Issuer nor the Guarantors may make payments in respect of the Notes and

one or more occasions redeem, at its option, some or all of the Senior Notes
at the redemption prices set forth in “Description of the Senior Notes—
_Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional_
amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption date.

At any time prior to February 1, 2016, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem
up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes issued
under the Senior Notes Indenture (including additional notes) using the
proceeds of certain equity offerings, at the redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption
date; provided that at least 65% the Senior Notes issued under the Senior
Notes Indenture (including additional notes) remain outstanding after the
redemption. See “Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption.”


**Change of Control ....................... If a change of control occurs, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must offer to**
purchase each holder’s Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes Issuer
must offer to purchase each holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price of
101% of the principal amount of the relevant Notes and Senior Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but
excluding) the date of purchase. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Purchase of Notes upon Change of Control” and “Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Purchase of Notes upon Change of Control.”_


**Redemption for Taxation**
**Reasons .....................................**


If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction impose
certain withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Senior
Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, the relevant Issuer may redeem all but
not some of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the date of
redemption. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional
_Redemption—Tax Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Optional Redemption—Tax Redemption.”_


**Additional Amounts .................... All payments made by any of the relevant Issuer or any Guarantor makes**
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes or its Note
Guarantee, as applicable, will be made without withholding or deduction for,
or on account of, any present or future taxes in any taxing jurisdiction unless
required by applicable law. If withholding or deduction for such taxes is
required to be made in a relevant taxing jurisdiction with respect to a
payment on the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes or the Note
Guarantees, subject to certain exceptions, the relevant Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay the additional amounts necessary so
that the net amount received after the withholding or deduction is not less

20


-----

than the amount that would have been received in the absence of the
withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Additional Amounts” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Additional_
_Amounts.”_

**Certain Covenants** ....................... The Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture
contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the relevant
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (and, in the case of the Existing Senior
Secured Notes Indenture with respect to certain covenants, the Luxembourg
Security Providers and Holdco) to:

                - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;

                - make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions;

                - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                - sell certain assets;

                - guarantee additional debt without also guaranteeing the Senior Secured
Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable;

                - create restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to the relevant Issuer;

                - engage in business other than certain specified lines of business;

                - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

                - merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or substantially
all of the relevant Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s assets;

                - impair the Security Interests for the benefit of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable; and

                - in the case of the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, change the
center of main interests of Top Luxco and Luxco prior to a change of
control.

These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and
exceptions as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants.”_

**Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information,**
**Pro Forma and Other Data**

The summary historical consolidated financial information, pro forma financial information and other data of
the Company as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and as of and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014 have been extracted from the following:

- the Company’s 2011 Unaudited Financial Information;

- the Company’s 2012 IFRS Financial Statements;

- the Company’s 2013 IFRS Financial Statements;

- the Company’s Q3 2014 IFRS Financial Statements;

- Novescia’s 2013 IFRS Financial Statements;

- Novescia’s Q3 2014 Financial Statements; and

- the Pro Forma Financial Information.

We also present adjusted financial data to exclude certain items including

- expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions completed during the period (advisory fees and other one
off items) and restructurings, as well as all costs, fees and other expenses incurred in connection with share
capital increases or new indebtedness;

- the full year impact of cost savings initiatives that have been implemented or decided in the course of the
period, net of costs incurred to implement them;

- other non-cash items such as movement in pension and other provisions; and

- certain accounting adjustments.

We also present below certain pro forma financial data for the Company which is based on consolidated
financial information of the Company as adjusted to give effect to (i) the acquisitions and disposals completed
during the period January 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014 as if they had been completed on January 1,
2013 and (ii) the Novescia Acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2013. Although the Pro Forma
Financial Information includes certain adjustments to reflect the full-period impact of acquisitions and disposals
by the Company and its subsidiaries since January 1, 2013 and to eliminate the transaction costs associated with
such transactions, similar adjustments for acquisitions and disposals and the related transaction costs by
Novescia are not included herein. In particular, Novescia disposed of Novescia Aquitane and Novescia Côte
d’Azur in February 2013 and on January 30, 2014, respectively. Novescia Aquitaine’s net sales contributions to
Novescia for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 were €4.0 million and €0.4 million,
respectively, and its profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation contributions to
Novescia for the same periods were €0.6 million and €0.1 million, respectively. Novescia Côte d’Azur’s net
sales contributions to Novescia for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 and the nine
months ended September 30, 2014 were €12.3 million, €11.8 million and €1.0 million, respectively, and its
profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation contributions to Novescia for the same
periods were €0.8 million, €0.4 million and €0.3 million, respectively. In addition, the Pro Forma Financial
Information does not make adjustments for intercompany sales between the Company and its subsidiaries and
Novescia. This, however, has no impact on profit from recurring operations before amortization and
depreciation as the excess sales are eliminated in consumption of materials and supplies. We present certain
further adjusted data for the Company to give effect to the Offerings (including the application of the proceeds
thereof) and the Acquisition as of September 30, 2014. Our historical results may not be indicative of our future
results following consummation of the Offerings and the Acquisition. The as adjusted and pro forma financial
data have not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the
EU Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying
the adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial data have been audited or reviewed in accordance with
any generally accepted auditing standards.

This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy estimates, among others, relating to cost reductions and
other benefits expected to arise from the Acquisition as well as related costs to implement the Acquisition. The
estimates present the expected future impact of this transaction and the integration of Novescia into our existing
business. Such estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to
us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the synergies
arising from the Acquisition are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,
economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in the synergy benefit estimates.

The following tables should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of financial information”, “Use of
_proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected historical consolidated financial information,” “Selected historical_
_Novescia financial information,” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results_
_of operations” and our consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto included elsewhere in this_
Offering Memorandum. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future expected results.

(1) The pro forma net sales information is based on the Company’s 2013 IFRS Financial Statements and the Company’s Q3 2014 IFRS
Financial Statements and gives effect to (i) the acquisitions and disposals completed during the period January 1, 2013 through
September 30, 2014 as if they had been completed on January 1, 2013, (ii) the Novescia Acquisition as if it had been completed on
January 1, 2013 and (iii) certain non-recurring items during the period. See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

(2) Gross margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) total net sales less cost of sales/consumption of materials and supplies,
divided by (ii) total net sales. Pro forma gross margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) total pro forma net sales less pro
_forma cost of sales/consumption of materials and supplies, divided by (ii) total pro forma net sales._

(3) EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 represents
operating income plus the income statement line items for net change in depreciation, amortization and impairment. The income
statement line items net change in depreciation, amortization and impairment and net change in depreciation and amortization include
provisions for operational risks, disputes, pensions, bad debt and overdue receivables. Accordingly, EBITDA excludes these expenses
in addition to interest, taxation, depreciation, amortization and impairment.

(4) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted pro forma EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should
not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance
derived in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted pro forma EBITDA as presented in this Offering
Memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and differ from
“Consolidated EBITDA” contained in the sections “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes” of
this Offering Memorandum and in the Indentures. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted pro forma EBITDA for
informational purposes only. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions or
other transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates indicated. There is no assurance that items we have identified
for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations for
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted pro forma EBITDA are based on various assumptions (including the successful implementation of
certain initiatives), management estimates and the unaudited management accounts of the acquired businesses. These amounts have
not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of
operations of the acquired businesses or other transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated
financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when
making an investment decision. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted pro forma EBITDA because we believe they
are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted pro forma EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”

(P) We estimate that, as a result of the acquisition of JS Bio in May 2014, our consolidated business operations will achieve cost-synergies
of approximately €5.3 million on an annual run rate basis by December 2015. As of December 31, 2014 we believe we had
implemented approximately 90% of our synergies plan, including the following synergies (i) €0.3 million in general and administrative
expenses; (ii) €2.1 million in optimization of purchasing costs; (iii) € 0.1 million in logistics costs; (iv) €2.2 million in reorganization
and rationalization of technical platforms, staff and labs and (v) €0.1 million of specialized subcontracting.

These plans aim at improving logistics, medical purchases and lab operations.

(R) Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA is Pro Forma EBITDA adjusted for the adjustments listed under footnote (J) to (Q) above.

(S) We estimate that, as a result of the Acquisition, our consolidated business operations will achieve cost synergies of approximately
€10 million on an annual run rate basis by mid-2016. Those synergies will consist of (i) consolidation of administrative and support
functions at headquarters for approximately €4.0 million, (ii) reallocation of subcontracting from Biomnis to Cerba of approximately
€1.1 million, (iii) production synergies including the consolidation of technical platforms, closing of town labs and reorganization of
staff where Cerba and Novescia have common geographical presence of approximately €1.9 million, (iv) optimized purchasing costs
by leveraging Cerba’s terms and additional combined purchase power of approximately €2.4 million and (v) general and
administrative savings of approximately €0.7 million.

(T) We may not be able to achieve all such synergies for a number of reasons. This synergy estimate is based on a number of assumptions
made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in
estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates.

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_

**Risks related to our business**

**_The prices we may charge in our markets are dependent on tariffs set by governments. Efforts to reduce_**
**_government spending on healthcare and diagnostic testing may adversely affect our business._**

In the countries where we operate, most of our activities are highly regulated. In particular, there are mandatory
prices or pricing methodologies for all or substantially all of the clinical tests we perform as part of our Routine
Lab and Specialized Testing businesses. Tariffs are established by governments and we have limited, or no,
influence over the levels at which they are set. Revisions of tariffs may occur on a regular basis. Overall tariff
decreases, or tariff setting that fails to keep pace with testing costs, reduce our margins and may affect our net
sales from testing services, our operating results or the economic feasibility of providing certain testing services
by some or all of our laboratories.

We are particularly sensitive to prices in France, as our French Routine Lab business represented 31.8% and
37.8% of our net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30,
2014, respectively, and France accounted for 92.2% and 90.9% of our Specialized Testing net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Prices for substantially all of the
laboratory tests in France are regulated and set on an annual basis by the Ministry of Health (Ministère des
_Affaires sociales et de la Santé) and the National Health Insurance Fund (Caisse Nationale d’Assurance_
_Maladie, or “CNAM”). According to Comptes nationaux de la santé 2013, approximately 72.1% of the_
spending in the French private clinical pathology testing market was financed by the French social security
system in 2013. While the percentage of spending financed by the social security system has stayed relatively
constant over time, the regulatory tariffs in the French lab market have declined at a compound annual growth
rate of 1.1% between 2007 and 2012, according to the “Rapport de la Cour des Comptes.” These reductions
were carried out as part of a stated goal by the French government to enact approximately €100 million of
annual savings in French clinical pathology expenditures. Clinical pathology testing expenditures represented
approximately 2.4% of overall French healthcare expenditures in 2011. The CNAM revises the price catalog for
laboratory tests on an annual basis and we expect further downward pressure on tariffs in France going forward
as the government endeavors to further reduce the rate of growth of national healthcare expenditures, although
we are unable to be certain of the extent of any future reductions. Additionally, while the reduction in tariffs has
in the past been offset by growth resulting from a combined volume and mix impact, we cannot guarantee that
this favorable trend will continue, and a decline in volume growth coupled with further tariff decreases would
have a material impact on our net sales. Furthermore, because of the importance of the French market to our
Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses, further tariff reductions in France could significantly adversely
affect our overall performance. Finally, France currently benefits from higher tariffs compared to most other
European countries due to its fragmented market, and therefore has increased down-side risk for prices. For
more detail on French tariffs for laboratory tests, see “Industry—Clinical Pathology Testing—Market
_Overview—France.”_

In the Belgian Routine Lab market (which represented 8.6% of our net sales for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014), laboratory tests are state-regulated and prices are set by the national healthcare regulatory
body INAMI on an annual basis. According to INAMI, the Belgian social security system reimburses
approximately 75% of regulated clinical pathology test expenditures. Belgium has also experienced budgetary
pressures, setting annual caps for healthcare expenses. Currently, the Belgian pricing system includes a
“claw-back” mechanism that allows the Belgian government to recover budgetary overspend. On November 1,
2013, the Belgian government also reduced fixed-fee for ambulatory care by 9% and according to the
specialized press, the number of accredited laboratories has decreased by 12.5% between March 2010 and

34


-----

February 2014 (Le Medecin Spécialiste, n° spécial/April 2014, ISSN 0770-8181). See “Industry—Clinical
_Pathology Testing—Market Overview—Belgium.”_

In Luxembourg, the Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé) and the national insurance scheme (Caisse
_Nationale de Santé) sets the prices for all laboratory tests. The state reimburses 100% of test expenses at the fee_
levels set in the annual catalog released by government health authorities. The Luxembourg government has
also undertaken measures to control increases in healthcare expenditure through limiting the tariffs for
laboratory tests. See “Industry—Clinical Pathology Testing—Market Overview—Luxembourg.”

We expect increased constraints on government-regulated tariffs to continue in each of the markets in which we
conduct our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses. The recent financial and monetary crisis in Europe
has brought concerns over European countries’ sovereign debt and government spending. As a result, many
European countries, including France and Belgium, have announced or undertaken expenditure control
measures aimed at curbing spending, including healthcare expenditures. In particular, governments tend to
reduce in greater proportion tariff levels on tests that are administered in high volumes, which has a multiplying
effect on our results as the tests we perform in high volumes tend to be impacted by larger tariff cuts. Although
in the past price reductions have been offset by growth resulting from a combined volume and mix impact, there
can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case. Policies that limit or decrease the amounts we may
charge for our services or exclude coverage of certain of our services from public health programs may have a
material adverse effect on our net sales and operating results.

**_Continued weakness in economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses._**

The economic downturn and the financial and monetary crisis that Europe has been facing since 2008 have
increased the risk associated with conducting our business. Economic difficulties have resulted in reduced levels
of activity and have led governments, private insurers and patients to reduce their expenditures on healthcare,
which has affected our net sales and margins.

Where patients, directly or indirectly (such as through private health insurance premiums), are responsible for
all or part of the cost of laboratory tests, individual decisions to reduce healthcare expenditures may result in a
reduction of demand for our services. In France, for example, approximately 72.1% of spending in the French
private clinical pathology testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder
was covered by private insurance companies (approximately 25.1%) and by the patient directly out of pocket
(approximately 2.8%) in 2013, according to “Comptes nationaux de la santé 2013.” A decrease in household
disposable income, or the perception thereof, in times of economic downturn can lead to a reduction in
individuals’ healthcare expenditure. This may result in patients postponing certain types of medical treatment
and could result in a significant drop in the volume of business we are able to conduct through our Routine Lab
and Specialized Testing businesses.

Governments, as direct payers of a test’s price, whether in part or in whole, have also instituted policies
designed to reduce their expenditures on healthcare as a means of reducing overall budget deficits. As a result of
such policies, changes in medical guidelines could occur, leading to lower volumes of recurring tests. Such
changes could have a negative impact on our business.

Further, the economic downturn could also have a negative effect on the research and development budgets of
pharmaceutical companies with which we have contracts to perform testing work as part of our Central Lab
business and reduce demand for our services. For example, the availability of financing from banks or the
capital markets to the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry can have a material impact on their ability to
fund development of their products. Generally, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies tend to streamline
the development and testing of new products at times when the economy is depressed and when, as a
consequence, their own profitability and investment capabilities are limited. As a result, they tend to limit the
number of, and be more selective regarding, new trials and may also postpone or cancel existing trials when
proof of efficacy is not quickly evidenced. Reduced demand from our Central Lab clients could have a negative
effect on our results of operations.

**_We may not exercise full control over the operations of certain of our French subsidiaries in which we have a_**
**_minority voting interest and are dependent on the clinical pathologists who own a majority voting interest in_**
**_them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries._**

French law sets regulatory constraints on the corporate structure and nature of ownership of the share capital of
clinical laboratories. In particular, French law requires that a majority of the shares and voting rights of a

35


-----

laboratory company be held by clinical pathologists working in the relevant laboratory company. In addition,
this regulation requires that persons that are not clinical pathologists and entities that are not laboratory
companies cannot hold more than 25% of the share capital of a laboratory. See “Regulation—France.”

As a result, our corporate structure in France is such that our non laboratory company subsidiary, Cefid, holds
25% of the voting rights and share capital in certain of our French laboratory subsidiaries (currently Cerba
Selafa), with clinical pathologists operating such French laboratory subsidiaries holding the balance, i.e., a
majority of the voting rights. The by-laws of such French laboratory subsidiaries grant approximately 99% of
financial rights (rights to receive dividend payments) to Cefid as regards Cerba Selafa. In addition, Cerba Selafa
holds up to 49.9% of the voting rights in our other French laboratory company subsidiaries, with clinical
pathologists operating each such other French laboratory subsidiary holding a majority of the voting rights.
Cerba Selafa also holds between approximately 70% and 99.99% of these subsidiaries’ financial rights.

The subsidiary shareholders of our French laboratory subsidiaries have entered into shareholders’ agreements
with the clinical pathologists working in the relevant French laboratory subsidiary. Although these shareholders’
agreements provide such subsidiary shareholders with de facto control on major decisions relating to the
operations of the laboratory subsidiaries through veto rights within controlling bodies (board of directors or
strategic committees), the Company does not exercise control over the appointment by the subsidiary
shareholders of its representatives in the controlling bodies of the French laboratory subsidiaries, as these
decisions can be taken by the clinical pathologists owning a majority of the voting rights in the subsidiary
shareholders. In addition, the obligations and constraints resulting from these shareholders’ agreements are
limited by French regulatory constraints regarding the independence of clinical pathologists. See “Business—
_Our Specific Corporate Structure.” This legal structure does not confer on us the same powers we would have if_
we were holding all or a majority of the voting rights of our French subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent
on the clinical pathologists who hold the majority of the voting rights in our French subsidiaries for decisions
affecting these subsidiaries’ day-to-day routine operations. Although, with respect to other actions at Cerba
Selafa, we exercise de facto control, the clinical pathologists who hold the majority of the voting rights in our
French laboratory subsidiaries may not necessarily share our views on the manner in which the subsidiaries
should be managed and may exercise their voting rights in a manner adverse to us. This could disrupt the
operations of our French laboratories and divert our management’s time and attention from the day-to-day
operation of our business. If our business activities were disrupted due to a conflict with our clinical
pathologists, our operating results could be negatively affected.

In addition, under the terms of the by-laws and shareholders’ agreements of certain of our French laboratory
subsidiaries, we may be required to purchase shares held by the clinical pathologist shareholders, upon their
retirement or for other reasons. This could result in our holding a greater percentage of the share capital and
voting rights in such French laboratory subsidiaries than is permitted by French law. Although there is a
one-year grace period in the law to reduce the holdings back down to the maximum permitted level, if we fail to
reduce our holdings within such period, we may be required to dissolve or wind-up such subsidiary.
Furthermore, as the grace period does not technically apply to the validity of the licenses of such subsidiaries
and as such if we surpass the maximum ownership threshold for share capital and voting rights, even during the
one-year grace period, the licenses of such subsidiaries could be subject to revocation.

Although we typically seek to align the shareholders’ agreements of our newly acquired French laboratory
subsidiaries with those of our existing subsidiaries, as the consent of the clinical pathologists is required for such
alignment, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future, including in connection with the
Acquisition.

**_We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may face_**
**_substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be negatively impacted if we fail to comply._**

Our business is subject to, and impacted by, extensive, stringent and frequently changing laws and regulations in
each of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to:

- billing and reimbursement of clinical tests;

- certification or licensure of clinical laboratories;

- operational, personnel and quality requirements relating to clinical laboratory testing, including quality
control audits by regulatory authorities to which we are periodically subject;

36


-----

- safety and health of clinical laboratory employees;

- handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and infectious and hazardous waste;

- direct and indirect ownership of clinical laboratories in France (including the ownership, by the
shareholders of laboratory companies, of other businesses in certain sectors);

- outsourcing of clinical laboratory services in France;

- market share for clinical laboratory testing within a given geographic area in France;

- personnel redeployment or personnel reduction plans;

- relationships with doctors and hospitals (including laws and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and
regulating gifts or fringe benefits); and

- privacy of patient data.

These laws and regulations, some of which have not been fully interpreted by courts as to their extent, may
require us to modify our operations or impose additional compliance expenses or burdens or give rise to
administrative fines and penalties. For example, recent French regulatory reforms have imposed stricter
International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) operating standards (namely ISO 15189), and introduced
minimum accreditation standards for laboratories to be complied with by 2020 (with two intermediary steps in
2016 and 2018), the implementation of which is expected to be costly and time-consuming. The laboratory
accreditation process is likely to involve the preparation of written applications, site studies and assessment of
the scope of changes required to comply with new standards, the appointment of external qualified experts, the
training of our staff, the participation of our staff in the process in addition to their usual workload, the payment
of certain administrative fees and the implementation of new quality software. Accreditation may be delayed
based on many factors, including the number of sites operated by a clinical laboratory and the responsiveness of
the accreditation body, the COFRAC (Comité français d’accréditation). Although we have already undertaken
to conduct our business in compliance with these heightened standards, any further changes in laws and
regulations may require us to further modify our operations. In Belgium, accreditation under ISO 1589 became a
condition for the reimbursement of laboratory tests performed on the DNA of a micro-organism (virus) (see
Royal Decree of March 19, 2008 establishing the nomenclature of healthcare services relative to the public
health insurance and modifying the annex of the Royal Decree of September 14, 1984). According to a Royal
Degree of January 31, 2006, BELAC (Organisme belge d’Accréditation) is the only public body authorized to
give such an accreditation.

In addition, as discussed above, French law imposes stringent restrictions on the legal structure and ownership
of clinical laboratories. See “Regulation—France” and “—We may not exercise full control over the operations
_of certain of our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest and are dependent on the_
_clinical pathologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries.”_

In addition, we are subject to specific Belgian regulations relating to the operation of the clinical laboratory
business. See “Regulation—Belgium.” In particular, the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 (implementing article 3
§1(2) of the Royal Decree n° 143 of 30 December 1982) lists the four legal forms that clinical laboratory
companies should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public health insurance system.
These four corporate forms are: société privée à responsabilité limitée/ besloten vennootschap met beperkte
_aansprakelijkheid (SPRL/BVBA), société en nom collectif/vennootschap onder firma (SNC/VOF), société_
_coopérative/cooperative vennootschap (SC/CV) and association sans but lucratif/ vereniging zonder_
_winstoogmerk (ASBL/VZW). This Royal Decree (after having been extended once) expired on December 31,_
2012. The relevant agencies have not shown any indication that reimbursements would cease. The current legal
gap should be filled by a new Decree which, as of January 2015, is still in draft form and should be submitted to
the Belgian government for approval. According to oral sources at the INAMI, this draft Decree (i) will leave
unchanged the four legal forms that clinical laboratories should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by
the Belgian public health insurance system and (ii) will provide that these rules are no longer subject to
expiration. However, this information has been obtained from unofficial sources at the INAMI. It is currently
unclear whether the draft Decree will be adopted and, if so, what its content will be. The absence of any form of
extension of the duration of the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 could have a significant impact on all Belgian
laboratories run under the same corporate form as ours, including us.

37


-----

Through our Central Lab business, we are exposed to stringent regulations relating to the conduct of the
pharmaceutical business from drug safety regulators (such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.K.
Department of Health and the European Medicines Agency) and from quality control representatives from our
clients. We must maintain records and reports for each study we conduct for specified periods for auditing by
the study sponsor and by any regulatory authorities. At least once during each clinical trial, we undergo an
on-site inspection from our clients to ensure that we are meeting standards laid out in our customer contracts.
Changes to certain regulations or government programs that are not directly connected with the clinical
laboratory testing market, such as regulations relating to doctors, pharmaceutical companies (particularly in the
design and conduct of testing protocols in connection with our Central Lab business), health insurers and
hospitals, could also affect us and impair our results of operations and our ability to expand our business.

Although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations,
there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion. If we fail
to comply with applicable laws and regulations, if they change in a manner adverse to us or if we cannot
maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses, accreditations or other necessary regulatory approvals, we
could be unable to operate our business or commercialize our services in the relevant jurisdictions, be excluded
from participating in governmental healthcare programs, suffer civil and criminal penalties or fines, or incur
additional liabilities from third-party claims. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation could be
damaged, important relationships with government regulators or third parties could be adversely affected and
these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition and prospects.

For more details on the particular regulations that directly affect our business, see “Regulation.”

**_All the arrangements between shareholders of our laboratory companies that are not contained in the by-laws_**
**_could become unenforceable if they were not communicated to the relevant professional association._**

Article L. 6223-8 III of the Public Health Code provides that, in order to be binding and enforceable, all
arrangements relating to a laboratory company (including shareholder agreements) must be communicated to the
relevant professional association (Ordre national des pharmaciens and/ or Ordre national des médecins).
Failing to do so, the shareholding agreements pertaining to our laboratory companies could become
unenforceable.

For more details on the particular regulations that directly affect our business, see “Regulation.”

**_Our Central Lab business depends on the pharmaceutical industry and creates a risk of liability._**

Our Central Lab business relies on contracts with pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations
to carry out drug development trials and studies. As a result, our Central Lab net sales depend greatly on the
expenditures made by pharmaceutical companies in research and development. In some instances,
pharmaceutical companies are reliant on the strength of their financial performance or their ability to raise
capital in order to fund their research and development projects. Accordingly, economic factors affecting our
Central Lab customers’ financial performance or their access to the capital markets also affect our business.
Further, changes by health insurance companies or government payers in reimbursement practices or in setting
the tariffs for pharmaceutical products or changes in regulatory guidelines for compound testing could have a
negative effect on our customers’ research and development budgets. If pharmaceutical companies were to
reduce the number of research and development projects they conduct or outsource, our Central Lab business
and, as a consequence, our results of operations as a whole could be materially adversely affected.

Further, our Central Lab business exposes us to a range of potential liabilities related to several factors, such as:

- risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our customers’ property, such as samples, trial
products, records, work in progress, other archived materials, or goods and materials in transit, while in our
possession;

- risks associated with potential delays and/or cancellations of trials;

- errors or omissions from tests conducted for the pharmaceutical industry;

- errors or omissions during a study that may undermine the usefulness of a study or data from the study; and

38


-----

- errors or omissions that result in harm to volunteers during a trial or injury to consumers of a drug after
regulatory approval of such drug.

While we endeavor to maintain appropriate liability insurance coverage and to include in our contracts
provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability, these provisions do not
uniformly protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as negligence or misconduct.
We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of
defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party
who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our
insurance coverage or for which insurance coverage is not available. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to maintain insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us. Any indemnity or damages that we must pay in
excess of our insurance coverage could have a negative impact on our results of operations.

**_Failure to establish and comply with appropriate quality standards in the provision of our testing services_**
**_could result in litigation and liabilities and adversely impact our reputation._**

The tests we perform as part of our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses are intended to supply
healthcare professionals with information to help them establish or support diagnoses and prescribe medication
and treatment for patient care. Our Central Lab operations provide pharmaceutical companies with data on the
safety and efficacy of their products. Inaccuracies or negligence in performing our testing services could lead to
inaccurate drug efficacy and safety studies, incorrect diagnoses by doctors, prescriptions of inappropriate
treatment or decisions not to prescribe treatment when treatment is required, which may lead to illness, harm,
death, other adverse effects or liabilities. Errors such as misidentifying or inaccurately labeling samples,
compromising the integrity of samples and errors caused by testing machines or reagents may occur. Claims and
litigation against us may result in liability for the harm or other adverse effects caused. Payments related to such
liabilities may adversely affect our liquidity and financial position. The process of defending such cases, even
when we are successful in our defense, is costly, could distract management from executing our strategy and
could result in substantial damage to our reputation in the medical community and with patients. To the extent
we are held liable for misrepresentation or negligence, the damages that we may owe could have a material
negative financial impact on our business.

**We face risks associated with the acquisition of businesses, including the Acquisition, in connection with**
**our strategy.**

In the past we have made strategic acquisitions by acquiring large laboratory testing groups in France, Belgium
and Luxembourg, such as CBCV, Biolille, Biotop, Bioréunion, JS Bio and LLAM. Our growth strategy is to
focus on smaller acquisitions of laboratories and integrate them into our network, particularly in France, and we
may consider larger acquisitions in other regions and segments of the market. For instance, in the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 we have respectively
completed 21, 8, 6 and 1 acquisitions, out of which 18, 7, 4, and 0, respectively, were bolt-on acquisitions. We
plan to pursue our focus on small acquisition targets going forward and we will also selectively consider larger
strategic acquisitions to the extent they complement our network. Any such acquisition could substantially
increase the amount of our outstanding debt.

The success of our acquisition strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets,
conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such
transactions and integrate the acquired business into our group. Our plans to acquire additional businesses in the
future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities at an attractive price, particularly in France. The
continued consolidation of the French clinical laboratory testing market, as well as the restrictions on both
regional market share and outsourcing, may limit the opportunities for acquisitions. Reduction of laboratory
ownership constraints in France has led to the development of regional laboratory hubs that combine several
smaller local laboratories into a larger regional entity. However, French regulation still limits the proportion of
tests that one person or entity may perform in a specified territory, which limits our ability to pursue this
strategy. Further, French tax reforms may limit clinical pathologists’ willingness to sell to a potential acquiror
by imposing prohibitive capital gains tax rates. Some of our competitors are following similar acquisition
strategies and they, and certain financial investors interested in entering our market, may have greater financial
resources available for investments or may have capacity to accept less-favorable terms than we can accept,
preventing us from acquiring the businesses that we target and/or reducing the number of potential acquisition
targets. In addition, certain of our competitors already have, or may attain through acquisitions, a greater
geographical footprint within a particular region, country or within Europe, making them a more attractive

39


-----

acquirer for potential targets seeking to join a network, the size of which they believe will provide greater
business prospects.

We expand into new regions by first acquiring an existing regional cluster together with, or followed by bolt-on
acquisitions of, smaller laboratories that we transform into collection centers where samples are collected from
patients and sent to be tested at the regional technical platform. Generally, we acquire businesses based, in part,
on anticipated synergies that will materialize after we are able to combine the acquired business with our own.
The success of our acquisition strategy hinges upon the successful realization of such synergies within a
reasonable timeframe. Achieving synergies, particularly from the acquisition of large regional clusters, can be
difficult and uncertain. We anticipate such synergies based on our due diligence of the target company
(including its existing governance structure) as well as standalone business models. Changes in either affect the
time in which we are able to realize such synergies or our ability to realize them at all. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain the customer base, suppliers or other contractual arrangement with
third parties of businesses we acquire (in particular where they are subject to change of control clauses),
generate expected margins or cash flows, or realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including
growth or expected synergies, in the timeframe we initially anticipate, if at all. Although we analyze acquisition
targets, those assessments are subject to assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates, company
valuations and ability to redeploy the workforce. There can be no assurance that our assessments of and
assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may significantly
differ from our expectations. In most cases, acquisitions involve the integration of a separate business that was
previously operated independently with different systems and processes.

Even if we are able to acquire new companies, unless we are able to integrate the companies we acquire in the
future into our own operations successfully, our ability to expand our operations and operate efficiently may
weaken. We may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our business or such integration may
require more investment or time than we expect, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated
liabilities or contingencies with respect to customers, employees, suppliers, government authorities or public
health programs, private health insurers, or to other parties, which may impact our results of operations. Certain
of the businesses we acquire, including Novescia, may not have robust accounting systems and internal controls
and reporting systems, and as such the historical financial results of such businesses may be different from those
reported to us. Additionally, from time to time, disputes may arise with the sellers of businesses we acquire,
some of which continue to hold interests in the company and/or management positions. See “Business—Legal
_proceedings.” The process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our operations and may cause an_
interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses or a decrease in our results of operations as a result of
difficulties or risks, including:

- unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues (in particular where they are subject to change of
control clauses);

- loss of key customers or employees;

- delays in redeploying our workforce;

- difficulty in standardizing information and other systems;

- difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;

- difficulty in realizing operating synergies;

- failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that we have historically provided;

- added costs of dealing with such disruptions;

- regulatory and labor law restrictions on the redeployment or termination of employees;

- unforeseen challenges from operating in new geographic areas; and

- diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to deal with the
foregoing disruptions and difficulties.

40


-----

Furthermore, we operate and acquire businesses in different countries, with different regulatory and operating
cultures, which may exacerbate the risks described above.

If we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy or integrate acquired businesses successfully, our
business and our growth could be negatively affected.

**_Anticipated synergies from the Acquisition and JS Bio may not materialize._**

Upon completion of the Acquisition, we expect to achieve certain synergies discussed elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum relating to the operations of Novescia and its subsidiaries as Novescia will become part of the
group and become consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. We also include synergies relating to our May
2014 acquisition of JS Bio. We may not realize any or all of the anticipated synergies of the Acquisition or the
remaining JS Bio synergies or the synergies from the efficiencies implemented by Novescia in 2013 and 2014
that we currently anticipate, including if we are unable to consummate the Acquisition. Among the synergies
that we currently expect are synergies relating to the rationalization of technical platforms, reallocation of
esoteric subcontracting from Biomnis to Cerba, optimization of purchasing costs, rationalization of
administrative/support functions and other synergies. Our estimated synergies from the Acquisition, JS Bio and
the efficiencies implemented by Novescia in 2013 and 2014 are subject to a number of assumptions about the
timing, execution and costs associated with realizing the synergies. Such assumptions are inherently uncertain
and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competition risks and uncertainties.
There can be no assurance that such assumptions turn out to be correct and, as a result, the amount of synergies
that we will actually realize and/or the timing of any such realization may differ significantly (and may be
significantly lower) from the ones that we currently estimate and we may incur significant costs in realizing the
Acquisition and in reaching the estimated synergies. We may not be successful in integrating Novescia as
currently anticipated, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value thereof._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. Total goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the
fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired, was €686.0 million as of September 30, 2014, or 68.1% of
our total assets.

Goodwill is recorded on the date of acquisition and, in accordance with IFRS, is tested for impairment annually
and whenever there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things,
deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse
changes in applicable laws and regulations (including changes that restrict the activities of, or affect the services
provided by, our laboratories) and a variety of other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed
immediately as a charge to our income statement. Any future impairment of goodwill may result in material
reductions of our income and equity under IFRS.

**_If we lose the services of members of our senior management team, our business and operating results may_**
**_be harmed._**

The execution of our strategy and our continued success depend in part on the skills, continued efforts and
motivation of our senior management team. Our strategy for organic growth and improved operating efficiency
depends on our senior management having deep knowledge of our business operations. Our external growth
strategy requires knowledge of the dynamics and relevant players in the various markets in which we operate.
Loss of the services of key members of our senior management or experienced personnel could disrupt the
pursuit of our strategy. If one or more members of our senior management team or key personnel are unable or
unwilling to continue in their present positions, including for health, family or other personal reasons, we may
not be able to replace them easily or at all. An inability to attract and retain qualified members or key personnel
in a timely manner could have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_If we fail to recruit specialized clinical pathologists, our businesses, particularly our Specialized Testing_**
**_business, could be adversely affected._**

The success of our business depends on employing and retaining qualified, highly skilled and experienced
clinical pathologists who can maintain and enhance our reputation by providing testing services in accordance
with our standards. Our Specialized Testing business in particular is reliant on skilled clinical pathologists who
have the scientific and technical expertise required to interpret the highly sophisticated tests we perform.

41


-----

Although the labor market for clinical pathologists in general is favorable to employers, it may be difficult to
recruit and maintain the employment of the specialized clinical pathologists we need for our Specialized Testing
business. Failing to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_Increased competition could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations._**

We are subject to competition from other market participants, particularly with respect to our Specialized
Testing and Central Lab businesses.

We face competition from other specialized laboratories based on the types of services we are able to offer, from
the range of tests that we provide to the other non-testing services we provide to local laboratories, such as the
pickup and delivery of sample containers. Although our Specialized Testing business is subject to regulatory
pricing constraints in France (which accounted for 92.2% and 90.9% of our Specialized Testing net sales for the
year ended December 31, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively), we are not
technically subject to regulated prices in other jurisdictions. Price-based competition in countries where prices
are not regulated is, however, a commercial constraint for us as we have to propose to our clients competitive
conditions compared to competitors who provide services locally. In France regional laboratory hubs have
recently begun forming due to the easing of regulatory restrictions on ownership and are a new source of
competition for our Specialized Testing business. These hubs are increasingly able to justify the costs of
performing certain specialized tests due to the combined laboratories’ volume of demand. To a more limited
degree, our Specialized Testing business also faces competition from hospitals that are able to provide testing
themselves.

Our Central Lab business is less regulated than our other lines of business and subjects us to stronger
competition. We face competition from other companies based on their pricing, the scope of their testing
offerings, their scientific and medical expertise, their ability to process samples and report data accurately and in
a timely manner, their historical experience and customer relationships and the quality of their facilities. We
face competition from large international companies. In addition, we believe that regulatory developments and
price-based competition in particular will lead to further consolidation of the central laboratory testing market,
which may further increase price pressure in the central lab business. Certain of our competitors with greater
financial resources and stronger market positions than ours could reduce their prices further than we might be
able to in order to increase their market share, offer larger operational resources and broader geographical reach,
or conduct more effective marketing programs.

If we are unable to compete effectively with other companies, our results of operations may be materially
adversely affected.

**_The internalization of testing by hospitals and regional laboratory hubs, as well as the development of new,_**
**_more cost-effective tests that can be directly performed by the customers of our Specialized Testing business,_**
**_could negatively impact our testing volume and net sales._**

Our Specialized Testing customers include public and private hospitals and clinical laboratories that choose to
outsource their specialized testing. Our customers choose to outsource their specialized testing because they lack
the expertise or the resources to cost effectively conduct the testing themselves. However, as technology
progresses, customers may find it more cost efficient to perform certain specialized tests themselves. For
example, until recently, blood testing for the presence of vitamin D was a fairly complex procedure offered only
by sophisticated clinical laboratories. However, a new routine testing technology was recently developed that
allowed smaller laboratories with less sophisticated equipment to perform the test themselves. This led to a
significant decrease in the demand for our specialized vitamin D blood test. Today, we no longer derive net
sales from vitamin D testing in our Specialized Testing business unit. Additionally, as smaller clinical
laboratories consolidate, they may have the requisite financial resources and demand to begin performing certain
specialized tests for themselves and offering to do so for others. Manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test
kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care test equipment to doctors. Finally, over time, if
technology improvements or patient awareness lead to increased demand, tests that we consider part of our
Specialized Testing business may become more routine, tending to be performed by routine laboratories instead
of specialized laboratories, and thus subject our business to downward pricing pressure. If our customers
become able to perform specialized tests themselves, and if we do not offer new or alternative tests attractive to
our customers, the demand for our Specialized Testing business would be reduced and our net sales would be
materially adversely impacted.

42


-----

**_Failures of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of customers_**
**_or business opportunities._**

Information technology (or “IT”) systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business and across
each of our lines of business, including for test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of
medical data. Our operations depend on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT
systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures,
human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite the security measures we have implemented, our IT systems
may be subject to physical or electronic break- ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems.

IT problems may impact our ability to process test orders, deliver test results, perform or bill for tests in a timely
manner or maintain the privacy of the medical data we collect. If we experience significant or recurring IT
systems problems, including with our implementation of standard laboratory or billing systems, our operations
would be disrupted. If our operations were so disrupted, it could adversely affect our reputation, expose us to
litigation or regulatory sanction and result in a loss of other customers and negatively affect our net sales.

Additionally, as a consequence of having grown mostly through acquisitions, we do not employ a uniform
software platform among our laboratories. Newly acquired laboratories may continue to use their existing IT
systems for an indefinite amount of time after their acquisition, although we encourage them to adopt one of two
pre-approved IT platforms when they consider changing their systems. Because most of our operations involve
using a single laboratory for a particular sample and/or patient file, we do not believe it is necessary to
implement a uniform information technology system across our group. However, there is a risk that our
operations could be disrupted due to any incompatibility among the information technology systems we use,
which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_Failure to bill timely or accurately for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Billing for our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses is a complex process involving several payers.
Depending on the billing arrangement and the applicable law of the country in which we operate, the payer may
be a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients (such as national public health
insurance or a private medical insurance plan), a patient or other party (such as a hospital, another laboratory or
an employer) who outsourced testing to us, or a combination of these parties. Changes in laws and regulations
and the payment policies of third-party payers could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process. In
addition, we must maintain procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in order to
ensure that we bill properly for our testing, adding to the cost of the billing process and our ability to collect
payment. For example, new regulation in France in 2012 required that we invoice a routine laboratory that
outsources a test to our Specialized Testing business instead of invoicing patients directly. Certain routine
laboratories refused to comply with these arrangements, which delayed our collection of payments and
adversely affected our cash flows. In connection with our Central Lab business, we bill our clients directly
through a contractually arranged billing framework. Changes in the terms of contractual arrangements with
clients could result in further expense associated with collecting amounts due to us for our testing. In general,
failure to bill timely or accurately for our services or increased complexity in billing arrangements and
procedures may result in delayed payment, increase our working capital requirements and adversely affect our
results of operations.

**_Financial difficulties of certain of our clients or third-party payers may require us to write off debts._**

We encounter third-party credit risk where we are reliant on the ability of a third party to be able to pay for
services we provide. We are exposed to varying levels of third-party credit risk across our lines of business.
Generally, we bill patients directly for tests rendered as part of our Routine Lab business. In France and
Belgium, although the government sets tariffs for laboratory testing, only a portion of the cost is paid by social
security systems. For example, the social security system in France financed approximately 65% of the spending
in the French private clinical pathology testing market in 2012. In order to make up the difference, patients must
either pay out of pocket or file a claim with a private insurance company. As a result, we are exposed to the risk
of not being able to collect amounts due from patients who are unwilling or unable to pay the portion of the cost
for which they are responsible. Our Specialized Testing business relies on payment from patients or insurance
companies to cover all or a portion of a test’s cost, although in France, new regulations require that we directly
invoice routine labs outsourcing specialized testing. Collection efforts for amounts due from our Specialized
Testing business can be difficult, especially from patients in countries where there is no primary government
payer of healthcare expenses. In addition, our Central Lab business bills pharmaceutical companies and contract
research organizations directly for tests we perform. If a third-party payer or a company with which we have a

43


-----

contractual relationship undergoes financial difficulties, we may not be able to collect amounts payable to us,
resulting in write-offs of such debt. We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts and amounts past due. However,
there can be no assurance that such reserves are sufficiently large for the third-party credit risks we face.
Significant or recurring incidents of bad debts would adversely impact our financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Our Central Lab backlog may not be indicative of future results._**

Our Central Lab backlog of approximately €67.4 million as of September 30, 2014 is based on anticipated net
sales from uncompleted projects that our customers have awarded. Once work begins on a project, net sales are
recognized over the duration of the project. Backlog is the amount of net sales that remains to be earned and
recognized on written awards, signed contracts and letters of intent. While the amount of net sales included in
the backlog are reviewed on a semi-annual basis to reflect signed contracts and letters of intent by our auditors,
there can be no assurance that the net sales included in the backlog are a fair and accurate indicator of future net
sales. In addition, contracts included in our backlog are generally subject to termination by our customers at any
time. In the event that a customer cancels a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all
services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent customer-authorized services related to
terminating the cancelled project.

Our backlog may not be indicative of our future results and we cannot assure you that we will realize all the
anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog. A number of factors may affect backlog, including:

- the variable size and duration of a project;

- the loss or delay of a project;

- the change in the scope of work during the course of a project; and

- the cancellation of such contracts by our customers.

Also, if projects are delayed, the projects will remain in backlog but will not generate net sales at the rate
originally expected. Cancellation or delay of a large contract or multiple smaller contracts could result in
underutilized resources and require an adjustment to our backlog, negatively affecting our net sales and results
of operations. The historical relationship of backlog to net sales actually realized by us should not be considered
indicative of future results.

Failure to comply with and liabilities arising under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could
result in the imposition on us of fines, penalties and other costs and the loss of our licensing, which could have a
material adverse effect upon our business.

Our operations are subject to licensing and other requirements under EU, national and local laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment and human and occupational health and safety, including those
requirements governing the handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and biological, infectious
and hazardous waste, as well as those relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. For example, we
must meet strict requirements in all jurisdictions in which we operate for the disposal of laboratory samples at
authorized facilities and undergo regular audits from national regulators in order to ensure compliance with
mandated quality control standards. In addition, we must meet extensive requirements relating to workplace
safety for employees in clinical laboratories who could be exposed to various biological risks such blood-borne
pathogens (including HIV and the viruses that cause hepatitis). These requirements include work practice
controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures
designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.

The environmental, health and safety regulations to which we are subject, including those governing the
disposal of medical waste, are likely to become more stringent over time, and our costs to comply with these
requirements are likely to increase. Moreover, we could incur substantial costs and sanctions, including civil and
criminal fines and penalties, enforcement actions, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to operate as a
result of violations of our responsibilities under these laws and regulations, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business. We also may become subject to claims from employees or other persons, such as
those alleging injury or illness resulting from exposure to the samples or waste they handle.

**_Disruption, failure or unsuitable delivery of sample transportation services could adversely affect our_**
**_business and financial results._**

The proper handling of samples during collection and transportation is essential for maintaining their integrity
and ensuring safety from accidental exposure to potentially infectious microorganisms. The vehicles used to
transport samples must satisfy relevant legal, practical and technical requirements, which vary depending on the
type of samples transported. These requirements include, for example, the use of appropriate transport
containers and packaging, the labeling of containers, the manner in which samples and containers are stored in
the vehicle, the temperature at which samples must be transported and the duration of the journey. Drivers
employed to transport samples must be trained to handle biological samples in accordance with best practices
and applicable laws and regulations. Mishandling the sample in the collection and transportation process can
increase the likelihood of errors in laboratory testing.

Efficient transportation of samples is key to both our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses. Our
Routine Lab business operates on a model of several collection centers where samples are collected and then
delivered to technical platforms where testing takes place. We handle the transport of Routine Lab samples from
collection centers to technical platforms ourselves.

Our Specialized Testing business collects samples for testing from over 50 countries in Europe, North Africa
and the Middle East to be delivered to our laboratory in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France. In order to ensure the
smooth transportation of samples over such long distances, we outsource our Specialized Testing transportation
logistics. We do not control the facilities or operations of our outsourced logistics provider and depend on it for
its sample transportation services and conducting its operations in a manner sufficient to maintain the integrity
of samples. In the event of a fault on the part of our outsourced logistics provider, we have the contractual right
to take control of the provider’s vehicles and personnel to assure continuation of service. However, any
interruption of our outsourced logistics provider’s operations or any failure by it to fulfill its contractual
commitments could result in damage to our reputation, claims against us and the loss of customers, which would
adversely affect results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_A significant portion of our net sales is derived from operations we conduct at our facility in_**
**_Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France. A disruption in the operations of that facility could have a material adverse_**
**_effect upon our business and results of operations._**

All of the tests we perform as part of our Specialized Testing business and a portion of the tests we carry out for
our Central Lab business are conducted at our facility in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France. Our administrative
headquarters is also located there. As a result, its uninterrupted functioning is important to our business. If our
operations at that facility were to be disrupted or compromised for an extended period of time, it could have a
material adverse effect upon our Specialized Testing and Central Lab businesses and, as a consequence, our
results of operations as a whole.

**_We are subject to stringent privacy laws and information security policies._**

We receive, generate and store significant volumes of personal and sensitive information, such as patient
medical information, and are therefore subject to privacy and security regulations with respect to the uses and
disclosures of protected health information intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
such information. Privacy and security regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of
subjects, including:

- the circumstances under which use or disclosure of protected health information is permitted or required
without a specific authorization by the patient;

- a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health
information;

- the requirements to notify patients of privacy practices for protected health information;

- administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health
information; and

- the protection of computing systems that store protected health information.

45


-----

If we do not adequately safeguard confidential patient data or other protected health information, or if such
information or data are wrongfully used by us or disclosed to an unauthorized person or entity, our reputation
could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation.

**_Adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our_**
**_client base and reputation._**

We have been involved, and may be involved in the future, in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business, including disputes concerning professional liability and employee-related matters, regulatory
matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and health insurance carriers regarding, among other
things, billing issues. Additionally, from time to time, disputes may arise with the sellers of businesses we
acquire, some of which continue to hold interests in the company and/or management positions. See “Business—
_Legal Proceedings”. Some of the proceedings against us may involve claims for substantial amounts and could_
divert management’s attention from day-to-day business operations to address such issues. Proceedings may
result in substantial monetary damages, damage to our reputation and decreased demand for our services, all of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the period
in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**

We carry insurance of various types, including workers’ compensation, employment practices, pension-related
and general liability coverage. We maintain insurance policies both at the group level as well as policies for
individual laboratories that we operate through our various subsidiaries. While we seek to maintain appropriate
levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable and there can be no assurance that we will not experience major
incidents of a nature that is not covered by insurance. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we
believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that our insurance cover will be sufficient or effective under
all circumstances and against all liabilities to which we may subject. We could, for example, be subject to
substantial claims for damages upon the occurrence of several events within one calendar year. In addition, our
insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to
material price increases in the insurance market in general. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.

**_Labor disputes could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs._**

We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which may disrupt our operations. Labor laws applicable to our
business in certain countries, particularly France, are relatively rigorous. In numerous cases, labor laws provide
for the strong protection of employees’ interests. In addition, some of our employees are members of unions or,
based on applicable regulations, represented by work councils or other bodies. In many cases, we must inform,
consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or work councils in managing,
developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative procedures could
limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our ability to
respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important
strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative
bodies, which could lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business.

Although we believe our relations with employees are good and French law in particular limits the ability of
workers involved in the provision of healthcare services (which would include certain of our employees) to go
on strike, our operations may nevertheless be materially affected by strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns or
other labor-related developments in the future, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Our employees in certain countries benefit from
collective bargaining agreements, and we may not be able to periodically renegotiate collective agreements on
acceptable terms. Settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our
employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may adversely affect our labor costs, productivity and
flexibility.

**_The results of some entities are fully consolidated in the financial statements of the Company, despite the fact_**
**_that the Company holds less than 50% of the voting rights for such entities._**

The results of our French subsidiaries are fully consolidated in the consolidated balance sheet and income
statement of the Original Company and of the Company despite us owning, directly or indirectly, less than 50%

46


-----

of the voting rights of our French laboratory subsidiaries. See “—We may not exercise full control over the
_operations of certain of our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest and are dependent_
_on the clinical pathologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such_
_subsidiaries.” However, although Cefid, our wholly- owned subsidiary, holds, directly or indirectly, less than a_
majority of the voting rights for these French laboratory subsidiaries, the by-laws of these entities grant Cefid,
directly or indirectly, between approximately 70% and 99.99% of the financial rights in such entities, including
through, in certain cases, share capital. However, decisions by such French laboratory subsidiaries to pay
dividends in excess of those required by the by-laws and shareholders’ agreements are not controlled by us and
we may not have access to all the cash in such entities.

In addition, because Cefid owns, directly or indirectly, less than 100% of the financial rights in certain of our
French laboratory subsidiaries, we have access to only a portion of the EBITDA and assets of these entities.

**_This Offering Memorandum includes only limited information regarding Novescia._**

The financial information that we have provided regarding Novescia includes financial statements for the most
recent period, i.e., the nine months ended September 30, 2014, that have not been prepared in accordance with
IAS34 under IFRS and do not include comparative information for the nine months ended September 30, 2013
and certain footnotes required by IAS 34. Furthermore, the pro forma financial information for the
twelve-months ended September 30, 2014 is based in part on the unaudited financial information of Novescia
for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, which is not included in this Offering Memorandum, was not
prepared in accordance with IAS34 under IFRS and represent Novescia’s internal management accounts and
thus may not be consistent with the other financial information presented herein. In addition, we have not
provided a discussion of the results of operations of Novescia for any period in this Offering Memorandum. As
such, the Novescia financial information presented herein may be of limited use in assessing the performance
trends of Novescia and its pro forma contribution to the Company.

**_The Pro Forma Financial Information presented in this Offering Memorandum may not reflect what our_**
**_actual results of operations and financial condition would have been had we been a combined company for_**
**_the periods presented and thus these results may not be indicative of our future operating performance. The_**
**_Pro Forma Financial Information included herein is subject to certain signification assumptions and_**
**_limitations._**

We have included in this Offering Memorandum the Pro Forma Financial Information which gives effect to
(i) the acquisitions completed during the period from January 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014 as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2013, (ii) the Novescia Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2013 and
(iii) certain non-recurring items during the period.

The Pro Forma Financial Information has not been audited in accordance with any generally accepted auditing
standards and it has not been reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted review engagement standards.
The Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, and because of its
nature, the Pro Forma Financial Information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not
represent the Company’s actual financial position or results. The Pro Forma Financial Information is based on
certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Our assumptions may prove to be inaccurate over time.
Accordingly, the Pro Forma Financial Information may not reflect what our results of operations and financial
condition would have been had we been a combined company during the periods presented, or what our results
of operations and financial condition will be in the future.

Although the Pro Forma Financial Information includes certain adjustments to reflect the full-period impact of
acquisitions and disposals by the Company and its subsidiaries since January 1, 2013 and to eliminate the
transaction costs associated with such transactions, similar adjustments for acquisitions and disposals and the
related transaction costs by Novescia are not included herein. In particular, Novescia disposed of Novescia
Aquitane and Novescia Côte d’Azur in February 2013 and on January 30, 2014, respectively. Novescia
Aquitaine’s net sales contributions to Novescia for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013
were €4.0 million and €0.4 million, respectively, and its profit from recurring operations before amortization
and depreciation contributions to Novescia for the same periods were €0.6 million and €0.1 million,
respectively. Novescia Côte d’Azur’s net sales contributions to Novescia for the years ended December 31,
2012 and December 31, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were €12.3 million, €11.8 million
and €1.0 million, respectively, and its profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation
contributions to Novescia for the same periods were € 0.8 million, €0.4 million and €0.3 million, respectively. In
addition, the Pro Forma Financial Information does not make adjustments for intercompany sales between the

47


-----

Company and its subsidiaries and Novescia. This, however, has no impact on profit from recurring operations
before amortization and depreciation as the excess sales are eliminated in consumption of materials and
supplies.

The Pro Forma Financial Information for the twelve-months ended September 30, 2014 is based in part on the
unaudited management accounts for Novescia for that period, which have not been audited and were not
prepared in accordance with IAS34 under IFRS and thus may not be consistent with the other financial
information presented herein.

See “Presentation of financial and other information”.

**Risks related to our indebtedness**

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding_**
**_companies that have no revenue generating operations of their own and will depend on cash from the_**
**_operating companies of our group to be able to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior_**
**_Notes or their respective Note Guarantees._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and certain Guarantors are holding companies with no
business operations other than the equity interests and/or intercompany receivables they hold in each of their
subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and such Guarantors are dependent upon
the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends, interest payments on intercompany
loans or other distributions to meet their obligations, including their obligations under the Senior Secured Notes,
the Senior Notes or their respective Note Guarantees, respectively. If the subsidiaries of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer do not fulfill their obligations under any intercompany loans to make
scheduled payments on the Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer may not have any
other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the
Senior Notes, as applicable. The amounts of such payments, dividends and other distributions available to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and such Guarantors will depend on the profitability and
cash flows of their respective subsidiaries as well as the ability of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under
applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and such
Guarantors, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions,
make interest payments on, or otherwise advance upstream loans to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior
Notes Issuer or such Guarantors to make payments in respect of their debt, including the Senior Secured Notes,
the Senior Notes and the Note Guarantees. While the Senior Secured Notes Indenture limits, and the Senior
Notes Indenture will limit, the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s or the Senior Notes Issuer’s
subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany
payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for
restrictions imposed by applicable law. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Senior Notes Issuer that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, respectively, have no
obligation to make payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, respectively.
Furthermore, with respect to certain French laboratory subsidiaries, we do not control the decisions of these
subsidiaries to make distributions in excess of the distributions required under the by-laws and shareholders’
agreements of such subsidiaries. Moreover, as we do not own 100% of the financial rights (right to dividends) of
these entities, whenever a dividend, distribution or other payment is made in respect of a French laboratory
subsidiary, a portion is paid to the holders of the relevant minority financial rights.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have, and after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant amount of outstanding
debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of September 30, 2014, our pro forma net financial debt
excluding shareholder debt and the French CPECs, as adjusted to give effect to the issuance of the Notes, the
application of proceeds from the Offerings and the other Transactions, would have been €743.2 million, which
reflects external interest-bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. See “Capitalization.” In
addition, our Revolving Credit Facility (which was not drawn on the Temporary Notes Issue Date) provides for
borrowings up to an aggregate of €50.0 million, and on the Completion Date and in connection with the
Acquisition provided for a one- time increase in the total commitments thereunder in an amount not exceeding
€30.0 million, subject to certain conditions, and at all times, the total commitments thereunder may be increased
to an amount which does not result in the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeding the
lower of (i) 65% of Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
including Pro Forma EBITDA for acquisitions and taking into account cost savings derived therefrom) for the

48


-----

relevant period and (ii) €200.0 million, subject to certain conditions. Our significant leverage could have
important consequences for our business and operations and for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited
to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debts and
liabilities;

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thus
reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, organic growth projects and for other general
corporate purposes;

- increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry conditions;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater financial
resources than we have;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and industry;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

- restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

- limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and
increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund
acquisitions, working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future operating performance
and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large
part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our
control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service
our debt or to fund our future acquisitions or other working capital expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including debt in connection with
future acquisitions. The terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement permit our subsidiaries to do so, in each case, subject to certain
limitations. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face could intensify. For a
discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior
Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under
certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. Under the Indentures, in addition to specified permitted debt, we are, or will be, able to incur
additional debt so long as our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Indentures) on a pro
_forma basis is at least 2.00 to 1.00. In the event such debt is senior secured debt (as defined in the Senior_
Secured Notes Indenture), our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture) on a pro forma basis is no more than 4.50 to 1.00 or, if incurred in connection with or at any
time after a “significant acquisition” by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a “restricted subsidiary” (each, as
defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture), 4.00 to 1.00. We are also able to refinance debt outstanding
under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with debt incurred in compliance with these ratios and then be
able to draw amounts under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement at a time when we do not meet these
ratios. The terms of the Indentures will permit us to incur future debt that may have substantially the same
covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive than, those of the Indentures. Moreover, some of the debt we
may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes or may be secured by collateral that does not
secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes
Indenture and our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not

49


-----

constitute debt under those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related
risks described in this Offering Memorandum.

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the_**
**_interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our_**
**_indebtedness._**

Under Article 212 § II of the French Code général des impôts (French Tax Code), deductions of interest paid on
loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code or on loans granted
by a third party but guaranteed by a related party (third party assimilated to a related party) may be subject to
certain limitations. Deduction for interest paid on such loans may be partially disallowed in the fiscal year
during which they are incurred if such interest exceeds each of the following thresholds: (i) the amount of
interest multiplied by the ratio of (a) 1.5 times the company’s net equity and (b) the average amount of
indebtedness owed to related parties (or to third parties assimilated to related parties) over the relevant fiscal
year; (ii) 25% of the company’s earnings before tax (as increased by certain items for the purpose of these
limitations); and (iii) the amount of interest received by the company from related parties (or from third parties
assimilated to related parties). Deduction may be disallowed for the portion of interest that exceeds, in a relevant
fiscal year, the highest of the above three limitations if such portion of interest exceeds €150,000, unless the
company is able to demonstrate for the relevant fiscal year that the indebtedness ratio of the group to which it
belongs is higher or equal to its own indebtedness ratio. Moreover, specific rules apply to companies that belong
to French tax-consolidated groups (intégration fiscale).

The Senior Secured Notes, which are guaranteed by certain of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s affiliates, may
therefore be considered, in whole or in part, as related party debt with respect to such Issuer. As a result,
allowable deductions by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of interest paid in remuneration of the Senior Secured
Notes may be limited. In addition, similar thin capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer for any amount of the Company Proceeds Loan as well as at the level of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s French subsidiaries for any amount of the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes or the Company
Proceeds Loan made available to the latter by means of intragroup loans.

In addition, Article 209 § IX of the French Tax Code imposes restrictions on the deductibility of interest
expenses incurred by a French company if such company has acquired shares of another company qualifying as
“titres de participation” within the meaning of Article 219 § I a quinquies of the French Tax Code and if such
acquiring company cannot demonstrate, with respect to the fiscal years running over the twelve-month period
from the acquisition of the shares (or with respect to the first fiscal year opened after January 1, 2012 for shares
acquired during a fiscal year opened prior to such date), that (i) the decisions relating to such acquired shares are
actually taken by the company having acquired them (or, as the case may be, by a company controlling the
acquiring company or by a company directly controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of
Article L 233-3 § I of the French Code de commerce (French Commercial Code), that is located in France) and
(ii) where control or an influence is exercised over the acquired company, such control or influence is exercised
by the acquiring company (or, as the case may be, by a company controlling the acquiring company or by a
company directly controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of Article L 233-3 § I of the
French Commercial Code, that is located in France).

We do not expect that this interest deduction limitation would apply to us because the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer should be able to prove that it actually (i) has taken and takes the decisions regarding the shares that it
owns and (ii) exercises control over its direct and indirect subsidiaries, as the case may be, that these decisions
are taken and such control is exercised by Frenchco, which indirectly controls the Company. However, this tax
legislation and the related administrative guidelines referenced as BOI-IS-BASE- 35-30-10-20140325 and
BOI-IS-BASE-35-30-20- 20130329 remain quite vague and subject to significant uncertainties as to their
interpretation. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the French tax authorities would not disagree
with our position regarding the tax treatment or characterization of the indebtedness of the group and that this
tax legislation would not limit the deductibility of interest on the indebtedness of the group.

Moreover, Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code provides for a general limitation of deductibility of net
financial charges, subject to certain exceptions. 25% of the adjusted net financial charges incurred by French
companies that are subject to French corporate income tax and are not members of a French tax consolidated
group (intégration fiscale) are added-back to their taxable result, to the extent that such companies’ net financial
charges (i.e. financial charges decreased by certain financial income) are at least equal to €3.0 million in a given
fiscal year. Under Article 223 B bis of the French Tax Code, special rules apply to companies that belong to
French tax consolidated groups (intégration fiscale). The 25% add-back is factored on the basis of the group’s

50


-----

consolidated taxable result and applies to the adjusted aggregated net financial charges incurred by companies
that are members of the French tax consolidated group (intégration fiscale) with respect to amounts made
available by lenders outside such group, to the extent that the tax group companies’ aggregated net financial
charges are at least equal to €3.0 million in a given fiscal year.

Finally, for fiscal years ending on or after September 25, 2013, the deductibility of interest is subject to a new
limitation pursuant to Article 22 of the French Finance Law for 2014, as codified under Article 212 § I(b) of the
French Tax Code. If the lender is a related party to the borrower within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the
French Tax Code, the borrower must demonstrate, at the French tax authorities’ request, that the lender is, for
the current fiscal year and with respect to the interest concerned, subject to an income tax in an amount at least
equal to 25% of the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules. Where the related party
lender is domiciled or established outside France, the “corporate income tax determined under standard French
tax rules” means that to which it would have been liable in France on the interest received if it had been
domiciled or established in France. Specific rules apply where the lender is a pass-through entity for French tax
purposes, a collective investment scheme referred to in Articles L. 214-1 to L. 214-191 of the French Monetary
and Financial Code (which includes UCITSs and AIFs as well as other collective investment schemes such as
SICAVs and SPPICAVs with a single shareholder) or, subject to certain conditions, a similar entity organized
under a foreign law.

Considering this legislation and guidelines issued by the French tax authorities (BOI-IS-BASE-35-50-20140805
and BOI-IS- BASE-35-10-20140805), this interest deduction limitation should not apply to us. However, we
cannot provide any assurance that the French tax authorities would not disagree with our position and that this
tax legislation would not limit the deductibility of interest on the indebtedness of the group.

The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in
France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants which limit our operating, strategic and financial flexibility._**

Our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture
contain covenants which impose significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on our
ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures or undertaking capital
expenditures;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create unrestricted subsidiaries;

- agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions;

- sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

- sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;

- engage in business other than certain specified lines of business;

- issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries;

- change the center of main interests of the Senior Notes Issuer and Luxco;

- impair the Security Interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior
Notes, as applicable; and

51


-----

- create or incur certain liens.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also includes limitations on acquisitions. These covenants could affect
our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or regulatory
developments or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions
could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, pursue acquisitions, investments or alliances,
restructure our organization or finance our capital needs or such acquisitions.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Indentures,_**
**_including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially_**
**_and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

Our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture
require us to comply with various covenants, including a financial covenant in respect of the Revolving Credit
Facility requiring us to maintain a specified leverage ratio. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving
_Credit Facility Agreement.” Our ability to meet this financial ratio could be affected by deterioration in our_
operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including, without limitation, decreases in tariffs or
reimbursements for laboratory testing services and unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you
that we will be able to meet this ratio. Moreover, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes certain
events of default (such as breaches of representations and warranties and defaults if we fail to make payment
when due on certain other debt) that are in addition to the events of default set forth in the Indentures. If an
event of default occurs under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any of our other debt instruments and
is not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate their commitments and declare all
amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross- default
provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets and cash
flow may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt and our other debt, including the Notes then outstanding, if
some or all of these instruments were accelerated, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we
might not be able to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an event.

Furthermore, we do not control a number of our French laboratory subsidiaries, and to the extent they are not
parties to the Indentures as Guarantors, they are under no obligation to comply with the covenants in the
Indentures. As such, any such French laboratory subsidiary could take unilateral actions that we cannot control
that could cause a breach of our covenants under the Indenture and an event of default.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or sustain our operations, including due to_**
**_factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations, which may_**
**_not be successful._**

Our ability to make payments on or to refinance the Notes or our other debt obligations, and to fund working
capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate
sufficient cash. This depends on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control.

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt
obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to
enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debt, including the Notes, or to fund our liquidity
needs. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations as
they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at
such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us

52


-----

to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of
existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.
Furthermore, we may be unable to find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing,
it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance our debt, obtain
additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our
debt obligations, including under the Notes. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreement or instruments
that contain cross-default or cross- acceleration provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not
have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding debt on a timely basis
would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional debt. In
the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be
required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of
our debt, including under the Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets. We may not be able to
consummate certain dispositions or obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such
dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt
service obligations then due.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks, and such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in
interest rates, primarily under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which are based on the Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin. These
interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these
obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on
the Notes. Neither our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement nor the Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains,
nor will the Senior Notes Indenture contain, a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating
rate debt.

**_The Eurozone debt crisis and related market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential_**
**_reintroduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely,_**
**_could adversely affect, including as a result of adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding_**
**_debt obligations that are euro-denominated, our business and our financial performance._**

Recent developments in the Eurozone have exacerbated the ongoing global economic crisis. Financial markets
and the supply of credit may continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing fears surrounding the sovereign
debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe (primarily Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain),
the possibility of further downgrading of, or defaults on, sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in growth
in certain economies and uncertainties regarding the overall stability of the euro and the sustainability of the
euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States.
Governments and regulators have implemented austerity programs and other remedial measures to respond to
the Eurozone debt crisis and stabilize the financial system, but the actual impact of such programs and measures
are difficult to predict.

If the Eurozone debt crisis is not resolved, it is possible that one or more countries may default on their debt
obligations and/or cease using the euro and re-establish their own national currency or that the Eurozone may
collapse. If such an event were to occur, it is possible that there would be significant, extended and generalized
market dislocation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition, especially as our operations are primarily in Europe. In addition, the departure of one or more
countries from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of, inter alia, exchange rate control laws. Should the
euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro- denominated obligations and
for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro would be determined by laws in effect at
such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could
adversely affect our trading environment and/or the value of the Notes and could have adverse consequences for
us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated and, as we have a substantial
amount of debt denominated in euro, our financial condition may be materially affected.

Furthermore, the Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain covenants restricting our and
our subsidiaries’ corporate activities. See “—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—We are subject to restrictive
_covenants which limit our operating, strategic and financial flexibility.” Certain of such covenants impose_
limitations based on euro amounts (e.g., the amount of additional debt we or our subsidiaries may incur). As

53


-----

such, if the euro were to significantly decrease in value, the restrictions imposed by these covenants would
become tighter, further restricting our ability to finance our operations and conduct our day- to-day business.

**_The interests of our principal shareholder may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the Notes._**

Funds advised by PAI control Frenchco, which owns 100% of the Senior Notes Issuer’s equity and indirectly
owns 100% of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s equity. See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party
_Transactions.” As a result, PAI has, and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect, among_
other things, our legal and capital structure and our day- to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and
change our management and to approve other changes to our operations. In addition, for compliance with
certain restrictive covenants, we will depend upon the cooperation of our principal shareholders who have the
power to effect compliance with such covenants. The interests of PAI and its affiliates could conflict with the
interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts
when due. Affiliates of PAI also have an interest in pursuing divestitures, financings or other transactions that in
their judgment could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to holders
of the Notes. In addition, PAI or its affiliates may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours
or do business with us.

**Risks related to the Notes**

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer._**

The Indentures requires us to make an offer to purchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase if we experience certain specified
change of control events. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes a covenant restricting the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and each of its restricted subsidiaries from offering to purchase the Senior Secured Notes
if the pro forma leverage ratio would exceed the ratio which is 10% below the applicable leverage ratio for the
relevant period under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or a default is then occurring or would occur
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement unless such purchase of the Senior Secured Notes is funded with
the cash proceeds of the issuance of shares by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or contributions to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer’s equity capital or from subordinated shareholder loans. Further, a portion of commitments
under the Revolving Credit Facility will be cancelled to the extent that any Senior Secured Notes, Replacement
Debt and Term Debt (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) are purchased in an amount
equal to or more than 50% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes issued on the original
closing date under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any amounts drawn in respect of such cancelled
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement would be required to be prepaid. Additionally, a
change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (which differs from the definition of “change
of control” in the Indentures), unless waived by the lenders, would result in a cancellation of the commitments
under the Revolving Credit Facility and all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility would
become immediately due and payable. The source of funds for any offer to purchase Notes required as a result
of any such event would be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including
borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by our subsidiaries. Sufficient funds may not be
available at the time of any such events to make any required purchases of the Notes tendered and we may not
be able to secure access to enough cash to finance the required purchases of the Notes tendered. Our failure to
effect a change of control offer when required would constitute an event of default under the Indentures.

Under the definition contained in the Indentures governing the Notes, a change of control may include a
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuers and their respective restricted subsidiaries taken
as a whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or
substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuers and their respective restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the
Issuers are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. Furthermore, certain important corporate events
that might adversely affect the value of the Notes (including certain reorganizations, restructurings and mergers)
would not constitute a “change of control” under the Indentures. For a complete description of the events that
would constitute a “change of control” under the Notes, see the sections entitled “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Purchase_
_of Notes upon a Change of Control”._

54


-----

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their investment returns by reference
to a currency other than euros, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to,
among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to
which such investors measure the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic, political
and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to
which such investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is
translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments.
Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars by U.S. investors may also have
important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies have assigned and may in the future assign credit ratings to the
Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk
factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the
rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given
period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in
its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the
credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and
terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuers and substantially all of their respective subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, are organized outside
the United States, and their business is conducted primarily outside the United States. The directors and
executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuers
and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action
under U.S. securities laws or under the applicable Indenture, you may be unable to effect service of process
within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors. In addition,
because a majority of the assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries (to the extent
applicable) and all or a majority of the assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the
United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover,
actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Belgium, France or
Luxembourg. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Belgium, France or Luxembourg of civil
liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in Belgium, France or
Luxembourg. In addition, the enforcement in Belgium, France or Luxembourg of any judgment obtained in a
U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be
subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a Belgian, French or Luxembourg court would have the
requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in Belgium, France or in
Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. For further information see “Service of Process and
_Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”_

**_The Note Guarantees and the Security Interests over the Collateral may be limited by applicable laws or_**
**_subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in France, Belgium and Luxembourg and the enforcement of
each such Note Guarantee and the Security Interests granted by such Guarantor, Holdco, Luxco or (with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes) the Senior Notes Issuer will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by such Guarantor, or that can be secured over such Collateral, as applicable, under the applicable
laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Security Interest is not in the
relevant Guarantor’s or grantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such guarantee or Security Interest

55


-----

exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or grantor, or such guarantee or Security Interest would be in
breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and would cause
the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur
civil or criminal liability. The grant of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent may also be voidable by the
grantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be
otherwise set aside by a court, if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the
grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a
greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is
commenced within a legally specified “claw-back” period following the grant.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Note Guarantee and/or Security Interest against the relevant
Guarantor/grantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors/grantor of security interests
generally and to limitations contained in the terms of the relevant Indenture and/or the documents governing the
Collateral designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors or
grantors, as applicable. As a result, a Guarantor’s and a grantor’s liability under its Note Guarantee and in
respect of the security interests granted by it, respectively, could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending
upon the law applicable to it.

In addition, the granting of new Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create
hardening periods for such Security Interests in France, Belgium (save for financial collateral arrangements
within the meaning of the Belgian law of December 15, 2004 on financial collateral) and Luxembourg (save for
financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on financial
collateral arrangements, as amended). The applicable hardening period for these new Security Interests will run
from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. The Indentures will permit the
Security Interests in the Collateral to be released and retaken in certain circumstances. Such release and retaking
will restart the applicable hardening periods. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be
enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared
void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, the grantor of Security Interests, or the creditor
thereof, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or grantor of such Security
Interests, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee on any of the above
grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or the Security Interests should be
limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to
that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor and/or grantor, including trade
payables of such Guarantor and/or grantor, as applicable. Future Note Guarantees and/or Security Interests may
be subject to similar limitations. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security
_Interests and Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral_**
**_may be complicated, involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate._**

In connection with the enforcement of share pledges over shares of entities with outstanding primary debt
obligations or holding companies of such entities, any sale of such entities is likely to involve a release of the
primary debt, which could result in a taxable capital gain to such entities. As the Senior Secured Notes will be
issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
Holdco or Luxco would involve the enforcement over share pledges of entities with outstanding primary debt
claims or holding companies thereof. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not prohibit the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Holdco, Luxco or their subsidiaries from incurring additional primary debt claims
in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of share pledges over shares of these entities may result in the
release of primary debt obligations of such entities (or those of their subsidiaries). Such release is permitted by
the Intercreditor Agreement and could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to
reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledges. Therefore, the value of the
pledges over the shares in Luxco, Holdco and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, as well as any subsidiary of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer that forms part of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and has outstanding primary
debt obligations (or which has subsidiaries of its own with primary debt obligations), is limited.

Holdco currently owns all of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (which shares will form part of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral), but pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, up to 5% of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer’s shares may be held by individual management investors and holding companies for other
management or laboratory pathologist investors (which shares will be subject to call options given to the

56


-----

Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes). The Senior Secured Indenture
permits Holdco’s shares (which are wholly owned by Luxco) to be held also by certain of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s shareholders, as well as future clinical pathologists and others. The Senior Secured Notes
Indenture also does not restrict the ability of Holdco or anyone else to transfer its shares in the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or the ability of Luxco or anyone else to transfer its shares in Holdco, so long as the transferred
shares continue to form part of the Senior Secured Collateral or are the subject of call options given to the
Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. To gain full control over the shares of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (or Holdco) in an enforcement action, first the pledges over both Holdco’s (or
Luxco’s) shareholding (as well as the shareholding of any other shareholder which has provided a pledge) and
the call options must be exercised. This process may be complicated and time consuming. Call options granted
by French companies will not be enforceable without the consent of French courts in case insolvency
proceedings or insolvency-related proceedings in respect of such French companies are commenced. French
courts may award damages to the call beneficiary rather than grant specific performance. If the call options are
not enforceable, it will not be possible to gain full control over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (or Holdco). The
Senior Secured Notes Indenture permits Holdco and Luxco to transfer shares that will be subject to a pledge to a
new party that grants instead a call option. Additionally, Holdco’s (or Luxco’s) pledges over its shareholding of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Holdco, as the case may be (as well as the shareholding of any other
shareholder which has provided a pledge), and the call options may not represent all of the shares of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or Holdco, as the Senior Secured Notes Indenture in certain circumstances allows up to
10% of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s shares to be subject to neither a share pledge nor a call option.
Moreover, in the case of a public offering at the level of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Holdco, none of the
shares offered in such public offering would form part of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral or be subject to
call options. As a result of this dilution in the shares of Holdco and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that are the
subject of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, enforcing over the pledges of the shares of Luxco, Holdco or the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer may not result in obtaining all or even a controlling interest in such entities and
thus such share pledges may be of limited use. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also provides that following
a change of control, the share pledges over the shares of Luxco and Holdco (and any call options with respect to
shares in Holdco) will be released.

Lastly, any enforcement action at a level below the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will require multiple points of
enforcement, as the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company with multiple subsidiaries organized in
multiple jurisdictions and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not, and the Senior Notes Indenture will not,
restrict the number of future subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or their jurisdictions of
organization. Enforcing security over multiple share pledges in multiple jurisdictions may be more difficult than
enforcing over a single point of enforcement and require longer recovery times and result in lower recovery
rates.

Call options referred to in the definition of Collateral do not confer the benefit of a Security Interest to the
holders of the Notes. Call options may be used by the Security Agent to gain full control directly or indirectly
over the shares of an entity in case an enforcement action is taken against any holding company of that entity.
Call options may only be exercised after a pledge over any holding company’s direct or indirect shareholding in
an entity is exercised. This process may be complicated and time consuming. Moreover, call options granted by
French companies will not be enforceable without the consent of French courts in case insolvency proceedings
or insolvency-related proceedings in respect of such French companies are commenced. French courts may
award damages to the call beneficiary rather than grant specific performance.

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of France and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable_**
**_to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are_**
**_familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent_**
**_conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

Our obligations under the Notes will be initially guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by Security
Interests over the relevant Collateral. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of France, the
Senior Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are organized under the laws
of France, Belgium and Luxembourg. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will include a pledge
over shares in Holdco incorporated under the laws of France, shares in Luxco incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg, shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer incorporated in France and shares of certain of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of France, Belgium and Luxembourg
and first-ranking pledges of certain bank accounts and present and future intercompany loan receivables held by
parent companies of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and France,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries incorporated under

57


-----

the laws of France, Belgium and Luxembourg. Lastly, the Senior Notes Collateral will include a second-ranking
pledge over shares of Luxco incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and a second-ranking pledge of
receivables held by the Senior Notes Issuer.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests
as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In particular, the French
bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many respects. In the event that any one or more
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors, or any other of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
subsidiaries, or any other grantor of Security Interests, experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or
similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Proceedings could also be initiated in
France, Belgium or Luxembourg to enforce your rights against Collateral located in those jurisdictions. Such
multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in
greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you
will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceedings. In addition, while the Belgian or Luxembourg Guarantors conduct the majority of their business in
Belgium or Luxembourg, to the extent that their respective center of main interests is deemed to be in France,
they would be subject to French insolvency proceedings (notwithstanding the opening of territorial proceedings
in the relevant jurisdictions), including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings)
and court-controlled insolvency proceedings (sauvegarde), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
(sauvegarde financière accélérée), or reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation
_judiciaire). In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of_
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their
rights. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests and Note
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of a Guarantor’s, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s or the Senior Notes Issuer’s, jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from, or in
conflict with, those of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar, including in the areas
of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and
duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question
whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under
the relevant Notes, Note Guarantees and Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may
receive.

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security
Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain
security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes priority (according to their
respective rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and the
holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on
the relevant Collateral. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests
_and Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

In addition, pursuant to European Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, the court
that shall have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the
Member State (other than Denmark) where the company has its “center of main interests.” Therefore, to the
extent that the “center of main interests” of the Senior Notes Issuer or any grantor of security incorporated in
Luxembourg, including any direct or indirect parent company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, is deemed to
be in France, courts of France will have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the relevant security
provider.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions. The rights of holders of the Notes under the relevant Note Guarantees or under Security Interests
in the relevant Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to
enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such
multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors. In addition, the bankruptcy,
insolvency, administration and other laws of France may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one
another, including creditors’ rights, the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the
duration of the insolvency proceedings. The application of these various laws in these jurisdictions could trigger

58


-----

disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to realize any recovery
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees or under Security Interests in the Collateral.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes against the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, the Senior Notes against the Senior Notes Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a
Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. The court may also in certain circumstances avoid the
Security Interest or the Note Guarantee where the company is close to or near insolvency.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note Guarantees and
Security Interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests and
_Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the securities account by judicial or_**
**_contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of securities rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a_**
**_public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only be enforced
following a payment default and may only secure up to the secured amount which is due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either
(i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of
the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of
the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the
secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets.
Enforcement by way of private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore,
holders of the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method.

If the secured creditors chose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual
foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed assets. Such
value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed
expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire). In a proceeding regarding a judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire), an expert is appointed to
value the collateral (in this case, the securities) and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured
debt, the secured creditors may be required to pay the pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between the
value of the securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of
proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the securities, an
enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going
concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of our
group as a going concern.

**_In certain jurisdictions, security over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly_**
**_to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by_**
**_local law._**

In Belgium and Luxembourg, the Security Interests in the relevant Collateral that will secure the respective
obligations of the Issuers under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the relevant Note
Guarantees are not granted directly to the holders of the Notes but are granted only in favor of the Security
Agent. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide, and the Senior Notes
Indenture will provide, that only the Security Agent as security agent, trustee and Parallel Debt (as defined
below) creditor has the right to enforce such Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will
not have direct Security Interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral
securing the Notes, except through the trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the trustee under the

59


-----

Senior Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the relevant Indenture) provide instructions to the
Security Agent for the relevant Collateral.

The security over the Collateral in Luxembourg is granted in favor of the Security Agent in accordance with
Article 2(4) of the Luxembourg law dated August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended.

Under French law and Belgian law, certain “accessory” security interests such as rights of pledge require that
the pledgee and the creditor are the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties
who do not hold the secured claim. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be
parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a
secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of
the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors (as principal
obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indentures (the “Principal
Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the
Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding
Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal
Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each
amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law or Belgian law will directly
secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness
secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of
such security interests except through the Security Agent.

None of the Parallel Debt and trust mechanism constructs have been generally recognized by French courts and
Belgian courts and to the extent that the Notes or security interests created under the Parallel Debt and/or trust
constructs are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from
an enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will
bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms
(Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n° 10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New
York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of
claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French
Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not
contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the
basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel
Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a
recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that
such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue
addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French
security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on
a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability
in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the
Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construction are
successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any
proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the
risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the
Parallel Debt.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_
n[o] 10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1,
1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition (the “Trust Convention”), so that the concept of
“trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of
_Guarantees and the security interests and Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—_
_France”._

**_Investors’ rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect Security Interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected,
and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security.
The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we
or the Security Agent fail or are unable to take the actions we or the Security Agent are required to take to
perfect any of these liens.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the relevant Notes under which the relevant_**
**_Collateral securing such Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent_**
**_or the relevant trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the relevant Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically,
including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale
covenant of the relevant Indenture, in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement and, with respect to the Security Interests granted by the Senior Notes Issuer or Luxco for the benefit
of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, upon a change of control. Additionally, Collateral securing the Notes
and Note Guarantees could be released if the acquisition of any entity that subsequently becomes a Guarantor or
a security provider under the relevant Indenture is rescinded. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” The Senior
Secured Notes Indenture permits, and the Senior Notes Indenture will permit, us to designate one or more
restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an
unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the relevant Indenture, all the liens on the Collateral owned by such
subsidiary and any guarantees of the relevant Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the relevant
Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate
value of the relevant Collateral securing the relevant Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such
unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and are not required to be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United
States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, outside the United States in offshore transactions in
accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit
the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Temporary Notes and the Notes
to ensure that all offers and sales of the Temporary Notes and the Notes within the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book- entry form only, and the Notes in definitive registered form, or
definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited
circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common
depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be the sole registered holder of the
global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of
the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying agent, which will make payments to
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts
that hold book- entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to
indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, the
Issuers will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the
owners of book- entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indentures.

61


-----

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act
upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if an investor owns a book- entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. The procedures implemented for the
granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under an Indenture, unless and until definitive registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. The procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be_**
**_limited._**

The Additional Senior Secured Notes will constitute a single class of securities with the Existing Senior Secured
Notes and will have the same international securities identification numbers and common codes as the Existing
Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Notes are new issues of securities for which there is currently no established
market. We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the
Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility
in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a
holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The relevant Initial Purchasers have
advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offerings. However, they have no
obligation to do so and may discontinue market- making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such
market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable
laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading
market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_Although the Issuers have made an application to list the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, no_**
**_assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of such listing._**

The Issuers have made an application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market. The Issuer, in the relevant Indenture, agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such listing as long as such Notes are outstanding. Although no
assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the
Indentures, failure to be approved for listing on or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indentures may have a material
adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**Additional risks related to the Senior Secured Notes**

**_The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Certain of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. Our subsidiaries do not have any
obligations to pay amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes or to make funds available for that purpose
unless they guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. Generally, holders of debt of, and trade creditors of,
non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payment of their
claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

62


-----

Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

- the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to
receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Senior Secured Notes and each related Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the
creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Our
subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes generated 11.6% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the nine
months ended September 30, 2014 and represented 8.1% of our consolidated total assets as of September 30,
2014. As of September 30, 2014, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes, the application of
proceeds from the Offerings and the other Transactions, our subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Senior Secured
Notes would have had total debt, excluding shareholder debt, of €54.3 million, all of which would have ranked
structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees. Any of the debt that our
non-guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the Indentures will rank structurally senior to
the Senior Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees.

**_Your ability to enforce the pledges over shares of our French laboratory companies included in the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes Collateral will be limited by French law restrictions on the ownership of laboratory_**
**_companies._**

French law provides that no more than 25% of the share capital of a French laboratory company can be held by
persons who are neither laboratory doctors nor entities operating clinical laboratories, and that the laboratory
doctors practicing within a French laboratory company must hold the majority of the voting rights within such
laboratory company. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce a pledge of the share capital of a
French laboratory company will be limited because it will be able to hold, following a judicial or contractual
foreclosure, a maximum of 25% of the share capital of each such French company which shares have been
pledged. If the Security Agent seeks enforcement through a public auction, up to 75% of the shares will need to
be acquired by either laboratory doctors or entities operating clinical laboratories and in any case, the Security
Agent or any other purchasers (other than the laboratory doctors practicing within such clinical laboratory) will
hold a minority of the voting rights. Further, no legal entity operating a laboratory was entitled to a shareholding
in more than two entities whose corporate purpose was to operate one or several laboratories and no acquisition,
by a natural or legal person, of shares in a company operating a laboratory may result in such person controlling
directly or indirectly more than 33% of the tests performed in the relevant territory (territoire de santé, being a
geographical area set out by the French health authorities). In December 2010, the European Court of Justice
ruled that the requirement regarding the maximum number of SELs in which shareholdings could be held did
not comply with the EU Treaty. Pursuant to decree n[o] 2013-117 dated February 5, 2013 related to the conditions
of operation of a laboratory by an SEL, individuals or legal entities who have an activity within the corporate
purpose of the SEL are no longer subject to the limitation according to which they could not own shares in more
than two SELs. We exercise control over our French laboratory companies pursuant to shareholder agreements
with the laboratory doctors. Certain of these shareholder agreements include rights of first refusal in favor of the
laboratory doctors for the sale of our shares in the laboratory company or may require the laboratory doctors to
approve the transfer of our shares. Such rights may impede the process or amounts recovered from enforcement
of such pledge. In addition, purchasers of our shares might not be able to succeed to our rights under the
shareholders agreement, which would decrease their ability to control, and therefore the value of, such
laboratory company. Certain persons are prohibited from holding directly or indirectly any shares of a French
laboratory company which may limit the pool of potential purchasers and our ability to enforce over the shares
of such a company. Persons so restricted include a person in the healthcare industry who prescribes tests, whose
activities include supplying, distributing or manufacturing medical devices, or who is an insurance company,
social security or welfare agency or a pension fund. These limitations on direct or indirect shareholding of
companies operating laboratories may compel creditors to seek enforcement of share pledges through a public
auction instead of seeking direct enforcement. These restrictions may limit the amount you are able to recover
under the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in the case of an event of default. See “Regulation—France.”

**_Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be required to share_**
**_recovery proceeds with other secured creditors, will recover proceeds only after the lenders under the_**
**_Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority hedging counterparties are repaid in full, and are subject to_**
**_certain limitations on their ability to enforce the relevant Security Interests or make payment claims against_**
**_or accept payment from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors._**

The Senior Secured Notes Trustee has entered into the Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the agent
and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, counterparties to certain hedging obligations and
the Security Agent. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement or we may enter into
additional intercreditor agreements in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the
enforcement of the Collateral, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and amounts received in
respect of such debt after certain distress events and the release of the Collateral by the Security Agent. The
Intercreditor Agreement provides procedures for the Security Agent to determine which enforcement
instructions it should act upon when conflicting instructions to enforce from different creditor classes are
received.

In order to deliver instructions, the representative of the relevant creditor class must deliver to the Security
Agent and the other representatives the proposed instructions at least ten business days prior to the proposed
date for the issuance of such instructions. The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that in the event that the
classes of creditors entitled to provide enforcement instructions to the Security Agent provide conflicting
instructions, such creditors must, subject to certain exceptions, consult with each other for a period of up to
30 days before any enforcement action may be taken. Although enforcement instructions given by the majority
senior secured creditors, which include holders of the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging counterparties,
will prevail after such 30-day period, if:

- the creditors under our Revolving Credit Facility are not fully repaid within six months of the date
enforcement instructions are proposed to be issued; or

- the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of the date enforcement
instructions are proposed to be issued,

then enforcement instructions by the majority super senior creditors, which include the lenders under our
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging counterparties, will prevail. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Consultation with Respect to Enforcement of Transaction Security.”

These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes in a number of
respects. Other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its subsidiaries during such period, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or one or
more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Senior
Secured Notes Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value.

In addition, in certain circumstances, including acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the Senior
Secured Notes, any amounts recovered from the enforcement of Senior Secured Notes Collateral or other asset
sales, will be required to be turned over to the Security Agent. Subject to the prior payment of fees and expenses
of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Security Agent, the Intercreditor Agreement requires the
Security Agent to pay amounts turned over to it or otherwise received by it in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes, such as proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and other asset sales, to
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations in priority to
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

Our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of €50.0 million and on
the Completion Date and in connection with the Acquisition provided for a one-time increase in the total
commitments thereunder in an amount not exceeding €30.0 million, subject to certain conditions, and at all
times, the total commitments thereunder may be increased to an amount which does not result in the total
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeding the lower of (i) 65% of Consolidated Pro Forma
EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, including pro forma EBITDA for acquisitions
and taking into account cost savings derived therefrom) for the relevant period and (ii) €200.0 million, subject to
certain conditions. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility permits us,
in compliance with the covenants in those agreements, to incur additional debt secured by liens on the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral, which debt may be entitled to recover proceeds from enforcement of such Collateral

-----

or amounts in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees after certain distress events
in priority to the Senior Secured Notes. Our ability to incur additional debt in the future secured on the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral may have the effect of diluting the ratio of the value of such Collateral to the aggregate
amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement.”

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral that has been granted as security for the Senior Secured Notes and future secured debt may be_**
**_secured by certain assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
described in this Offering Memorandum. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” The Senior
Secured Notes Collateral will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility on a first-priority basis, and may secure
additional debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees (which may
be structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees) to the extent permitted by
the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders may
therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral or a reduction of
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be applied first in
repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority hedging obligations before repayment of the
Senior Secured Notes and Note Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
exceed the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note
Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and
future senior unsecured debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees.
As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as Senior Secured Notes Collateral for the Senior Secured Notes is
less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in
full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the Senior Secured Notes, and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture allows the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain types of debt
permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the
Senior Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries
that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an
event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated, the Senior Secured
Notes and the related Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank
equally with the holders of other unsecured debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets that is excluded from the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes or such secured debt.

**_The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to_**
**_satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be_**
**_reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

In the event of an enforcement of the Security Documents, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying
the Security Documents may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been made in connection with these Offerings. The value of the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the
business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets
in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of
buyers.

The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part
because most of these shares and intercompany loan receivables may not be liquid and their value to other
parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof.
Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, include restrictions on persons
who may own or operate clinical laboratories. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of clinical laboratories (or
the ownership of an entity holding clinical laboratories) may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group
of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, the
transfer of clinical laboratories may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents,
approvals or filings. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all.

-----

As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Senior
Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to
cover the amount of debt secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares pledged
to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in
the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have
been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied,
leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the
shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the
value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral)
would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors’ remaining assets. See “—Your ability to enforce the pledges over shares of
_our French laboratory companies will be limited by French law restrictions on the ownership of laboratory_
_companies.”_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other
secured debt or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to
satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

**Additional risks related to the Senior Notes**

**_The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Certain of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Senior Notes. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligations to
pay amounts due under the Senior Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the
Senior Notes. Generally, holders of debt of, and trade creditors of, non- guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders
under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries
before these assets are made available for distribution to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor,
as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer (including the holders of the Senior Notes) and the Senior Notes
Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

- the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any
distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Senior Notes and each Senior Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries
not guaranteeing the Senior Notes generated 11.6% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 and represented 8.1% of our consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2014. As of
September 30, 2014, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes, the application of proceeds from
the Offerings and the other Transactions, our subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Senior Notes would have had
total debt, excluding shareholder debt, of €54.3 million, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to
the Senior Notes and the related Note Guarantees. Any of the debt that our non- guarantor subsidiaries incur in
the future in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Senior Notes and the
related Note Guarantees.

66


-----

**_Your right to receive payment under the Senior Notes Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior_**
**_debt._**

The obligations of the Senior Notes Guarantors under their respective Senior Note Guarantees are contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all existing and future obligations in
respect of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor. This senior debt includes the guarantees of the Senior
Secured Notes or in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes,
and the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. Although the Senior Notes Indenture will contain
restrictions on the ability of the Senior Notes Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred
may be substantial and senior to the guarantees.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Senior Notes Guarantor in respect of an insolvency event, the
holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such
Senior Notes Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such guarantee. Until the senior debt of
such Senior Notes Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Senior Notes would be
entitled but for the subordination provisions to be included in the Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made
to holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event
of insolvency of a Senior Notes Guarantor, holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor may recover
more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in respect of the Senior Notes Guarantor’s guarantee in respect
thereof.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Note Guarantees
provide:

- customary turnover provisions by the Senior Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the
benefit of the holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor;

- that if a payment default on any senior debt of a Senior Notes Guarantor has occurred and is continuing,
such Senior Notes Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its guarantee until such default is
cured or waived;

- that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness that permits the
holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Senior Notes Trustee receives a notice of such default,
such Senior Notes Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its
Note Guarantee, until (amongst others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after
the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and

- that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent
of the majority senior secured creditors or the majority super senior creditors, from taking any enforcement
action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances.

The Senior Notes Indenture also provides that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Senior Notes
Trustee will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior Note
Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture restrict the rights of holders
of the Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Senior Notes
Guarantor and by accepting any Senior Note each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these
restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Notes have limited remedies and recourse
under the guarantees in the event of a default by the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor.

**_The obligations owed to Frenchco under the Frenchco CPECs are not subordinated to the Senior Notes._**

The Senior Notes Issuer has outstanding as of September 30, 2014, € 3.7 million of Frenchco CPECs. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Frenchco CPECs.” As Frenchco is not a party to the Intercreditor
Agreement, although the Frenchco CPECs are currently by their terms subordinated to other debt of the Senior
Notes Issuer (including the Senior Notes), the subordination terms could change at any time without the consent
of the holders of the Senior Notes. Moreover, under the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes
Issuer and Luxco could incur up to €10 million of total indebtedness owed to Frenchco and its affiliates in the
future without such indebtedness being subordinated or subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. Any such
indebtedness incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer would rank pari passu with the Senior Notes and any such
indebtedness incurred by Luxco would be structurally senior to the Senior Notes. As such, in the event of an

67


-----

enforcement action against the Senior Notes Issuer, claims by the holders of the Senior Notes could be required
to be shared with (or could come behind) the claims of our shareholders and their affiliates.

**_Your security over the Senior Notes Collateral ranks behind the security benefiting the holders of the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes and the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and your rights to enforce your security_**
**_over the Senior Notes Collateral are limited._**

All of the Senior Notes Collateral is also pledged to the security agent for the benefit of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes and the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and to the security agent for the benefit of
holders of the Senior Notes. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents, the Senior Secured
Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are secured by first-ranking security interests in all of the
Senior Notes Collateral and the proceeds of any sale of such Senior Notes Collateral on enforcement will be
applied first to repay all debt of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain hedging obligations. Consequently, you may not be able to recover on such Collateral
because the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the
counterparties to certain hedging obligations will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any
enforcement of such Collateral.

**_The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral that has been_**
**_granted as security for the Senior Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not_**
**_secure the Senior Notes._**

The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral described in this
Offering Memorandum. See “Description of the Senior Notes—Security.” The Senior Notes Collateral will also
secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility on a first-ranking basis, and may secure
additional debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees to the
extent permitted by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the
holders may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Senior Notes Collateral or a
reduction of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the Senior Notes Collateral will be applied in repayment of the
Revolving Credit Facility, certain priority hedging obligations followed by the Senior Secured Notes before
repayment of the Senior Notes and Senior Note Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Senior
Notes exceed the value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Note
Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and
future senior unsecured debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. As a
result, if the value of the assets pledged as Senior Notes Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the
holders of the Senior Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure
the Senior Notes, and the Senior Notes Indenture allows the Senior Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to
secure certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Senior Notes Indenture (which may be
structurally senior to the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the
restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If
an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Notes are accelerated, the Senior Notes and the
Senior Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with
the holders of other unsecured debt of the Senior Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any
property or assets that is excluded from the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes or such secured
debt.

**_The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under the Senior Notes and such Senior Notes Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_**
**_circumstances._**

In the event of an enforcement of the relevant Security Documents, the proceeds from the sale of the assets
underlying the relevant Security Documents may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors with respect to the Senior Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Senior
Notes Collateral has been made in connection with these Offerings. The value of the Senior Notes Collateral
will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going
concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the
condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other Senior Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the
Senior Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Notes, in part because most of these shares

and intercompany loan receivables may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value
to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Notes Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there
will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we
operate, such as France, include restrictions on persons who may own or operate clinical laboratories. In the
event of foreclosure, the transfer of clinical laboratories (or the ownership of an entity holding clinical
laboratories) may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets,
thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, the transfer of clinical laboratories may require, in
certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings. Such consents, approvals
or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a
temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior Notes Collateral may be significantly
decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Senior Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior
Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of debt secured by such Senior Notes Collateral. With
respect to any shares pledged to secure the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, such shares may also
have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the
entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been
pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the
creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an
enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Senior Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of
the Senior Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Notes, the holders of the
Senior Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Notes Collateral) would have
only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Notes
Guarantors’ remaining assets. See “—Your ability to enforce the pledges over shares of our French laboratory
_companies will be limited by French law restrictions on the ownership of laboratory companies.”_

The Senior Notes Indenture permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the
Senior Notes on the Senior Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third parties
enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture or the relevant
Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Notes
Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior
Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, holders of such additional notes
would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting
your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Notes Collateral.

**_The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum includes only limited detail regarding the_**
**_Senior Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries that are holding companies of the Company._**

We have not included any financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer either on a standalone basis or
consolidated with its subsidiaries in this Offering Memorandum. Although the Senior Notes Issuer, Luxco and
Holdco, which do not engage in any activities other than those relating to holding the shares of their subsidiaries
(including the Company), these entities have external liabilities which are not subordinated to the Senior Notes
and have experienced losses in the past and may do so in the future. The limited information that we have
provided regarding these external liabilities and losses on an unconsolidated basis is not based on IFRS accounts
in all cases and thus may not be comparable to, and could differ significantly from, such information prepared
on the basis of IFRS. As the financial information of the Company that is presented in this Offering
Memorandum does not include the results of Holdco, Luxco and the Senior Notes Issuer, such financial
information may be of limited use in assessing the financial position of the Senior Notes Issuer.

**The Acquisition**

**The Novescia Acquisition**

On December 19, 2014, the Company and the direct and indirect holders of all of the securities (including the
shares) issued by Novescia SAS entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement under which the Company will
acquire directly and/or indirectly all of the Target Group securities subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions precedent, including antitrust clearance. Novescia SAS is a holding company whose securities are
allocated between its holders including Finescia SAS (RCS Paris 513 701 276), a holding company regrouping
various investors including Financière Murillo SAS (RCS Paris 523 357 838), Manescia (RCS Nanterre
513 642 231), Manescia 3 (RCS Nanterre 801 486 770) and Bio-Invest Novescia (RCS Nanterre 791 852 759),
investment vehicles of the corporate officers and former and current employees or biologists of Novescia.
Novescia SAS owns (i) directly the entire capital and voting rights of Laboratoris Amiel, S.L., a Spanish law
company (“Laboratis Amiel”) and Labs Toscana S.r.l., an Italian law company (“Labs Toscana”), which run one
or several medical biology laboratories, and (ii) indirectly, through Laboratoris Amiel and Labs Toscana,
shareholdings in companies running multi-site medical biology laboratories, with up to a maximum of 49.99%
of their voting rights, in accordance with the applicable regulation to these companies. As of the Completion
Date, Cerba Selata owns, directly or indirectly, approximately 99% of the financial rights of the operating
subsidiaries of Novescia SAS.

Under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased indirectly the entirety of the
Novescia SAS securities through the direct purchase of the entirety of the shares issued by Financière Murillo
and the shares issued by Finescia that were not held by Financière Murillo; the entirety of the shares issued by
Manescia, Manescia 3 and Bio-Invest Novescia; and the securities issued by Novescia SAS that were not held
by Finescia, Manescia, Manescia 3 and Bio-Invest Novescia.

The Acquisition was paid for in cash, and certain shareholders who are board members, employees or biologists
currently working within Novescia were granted the possibility to contribute their shares in kind and receive
shares of Frenchco, Manco or a specific-purpose company affiliated with Frenchco in exchange.

**Novescia**

Novescia is a clinical laboratory group mostly active in France, and we believe its competitive position is
particularly well established. As of June 2014, it provides its services through a network of 95 collection centers
and 12 technical platforms in 9 regions, employing approximately 145 biologists, doctors and pharmacists. The
strategic rationale of the Acquisition was to create a new presence in the Rhône-Alpes region encompassing
Lyon, the second-largest city in France, which will allow us to gain broader geographical coverage in our core
French market and to strengthen our business with private hospitals, a significant source of business for
Novescia. The Novescia network in the Rhône-Alpes region includes 15 laboratories and processes up to 2500
files per day through its technical platform located in Lyon. The Acquisition will increase our presence in the
broader Paris/Île-de-France region, where Novescia has over 40 laboratories and management estimates that on
a pro forma basis for the Acquisition, approximately 20% of the French Routine operations will be based on
private hospital outsourcing contracts.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and
December 31, 2012, Novescia generated net sales of €112.6 million, €162.4 million and €164.7 million,
respectively, and profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation of €17.8 million,
€19.7 million and €11.8 million, respectively. The €2.3 million decline in revenue from 2012 to 2013 is
primarily due to the sale of under-performing labs in the Bordeaux (Novescia Aquitaine) region of France,
which occurred in February 2013. Revenue of Novescia in 2014 was also negatively impacted by the sale of
under-performing labs in the Nice region of France (Novescia Côte d’Azur), which occurred on January 30,
2014. The increase in profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation from 2012 and 2013
primarily reflects the impact of the restructuring program undertaken by Novescia in 2012 and 2013 to reduce
costs, in particular personnel costs. These cost savings improvements continued into 2014.

We estimate that, as a result of the Acquisition, our consolidated business operations will achieve cost synergies
of approximately €10 million on an annual run rate basis by March 2016, primarily relating to:

- consolidation of administrative and support functions at headquarters for approximately €4.0 million;

- reallocation of subcontracting from Biomnis to Cerba of approximately €1.1 million;

70


-----

- production synergies including the consolidation of technical platforms, closing of town labs and
reorganization of staff where Cerba and Novescia have common geographical presence of approximately
€1.9 million;

- optimized purchasing costs by leveraging Cerba’s terms and additional combined purchase power of
approximately €2.4 million; and

- general and administrative savings of approximately €0.7 million.

We believe that we will have to make capital expenditures and/or incur one-off costs of approximately
€8 million to achieve such cost synergies. Please see “Forward-Looking Statements.”

This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy estimates, among others, relating to cost reductions and
other benefits expected to arise from the Acquisition as well as related costs to implement the Acquisition. The
estimates present the expected future impact of this transaction and the integration of Novescia into our existing
business. Such estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to
us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the synergies
arising from the Acquisition are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,
economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in the synergy benefit estimates.

**Use of proceeds**

The aggregate principal amount of the Temporary Senior Secured Notes and the Temporary Senior Notes will
be €85.0 million and €145.0 million, respectively, and the gross proceeds from the Offerings are expected to be
€234.0 million, excluding payment by the purchasers of the Temporary Senior Secured Notes of an amount
equal to the accrued interest on the Temporary Senior Secured Notes from February 1, 2015 to, but not
including, the Temporary Notes Issue Date. Upon release from escrow of the proceeds from the sale of the
Temporary Notes, we used the gross proceeds from the Offerings and existing cash reserves of €3.3 million to
fund the purchase price of the Acquisition and pay certain transaction costs, including underwriting
commissions as well as fees for legal, accounting, printing, ratings advisory and other professional services.

The following table sets forth our expected estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Offerings. Amounts included in the table below are based on data for the nine months ended September 30,
2014. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences
from our estimates of fees and expenses on and after the Completion Date.

**Unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information**

The following unaudited pro forma income statements have been prepared on the basis set out in the notes
below and have been presented for illustrative purposes only in order to give effect to the following transactions
as if they occurred on January 1, 2013:

(i) the acquisitions and disposal of Bionord, CHB, Bastard, Stal and JS Bio and disposal of
Biotop Place Boulot completed during the period from January 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014; and

(ii) the acquisition of Novescia;

(iii) the contemplated financing of the acquisition of Novescia, as described in the section
“Sources and uses” of this Offering Memorandum; and

(iv) certain non-recurring items.

The unaudited pro forma income statements have been derived by applying pro forma adjustments to the
historical financial statements of the Company, included elsewhere herein. Audited historical financial
information of the Company and Novescia as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS. Unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company as of
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34. Unaudited
interim financial statements of Novescia as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS. Historical financial information for Novescia has been extracted from the
Novescia audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, and the Novescia
unaudited condensed interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014,
which have been prepared in accordance with the measurement and recognition principles described in the notes
thereto, an English translation of which is included in this Offering Memorandum.

The unaudited pro forma income statement for the last twelve months ended September 30, 2014 for the
Company and Novescia have been calculated by adding the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the unaudited pro forma income statement for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 and subtracting an unaudited pro forma income statement for the nine months ended
September 30, 2013.

The acquisition of Novescia is accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under IFRS 3—Business
Combinations. Under this method, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the
net assets is goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price for acquisition requires extensive use of accounting
estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair value. Accordingly, unaudited pro forma income
statements do not reflect any preliminary impact of purchase price allocation.

We describe the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments in the accompanying notes, which should be
read in conjunction with this unaudited pro forma financial information. The pro forma adjustments are based
upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.

The unaudited pro forma income statements are presented for informational purposes only. They do not purport
to present what the Company’s results of operations would have been had these transactions actually occurred
on the dates indicated, nor they purport to represent Company’s result of operations for any future period.
Furthermore, no effect has been given in the unaudited pro forma income statements for synergistic benefits that
may be realized through the combinations of the Company and Novescia or the costs that may be incurred in
integrating or restructuring their operations.

The unaudited pro forma information below has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

The unaudited pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
“Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations” and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements_
and the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

Although the Pro Forma Financial Information includes certain adjustments to reflect the full-period impact of
acquisitions and disposals by the Company and its subsidiaries since January 1, 2013 and to eliminate the
transaction costs associated with such transactions, similar adjustments for acquisitions and disposals and the
related transaction costs by Novescia are not included herein. In particular, Novescia disposed of Novescia
Aquitane and Novescia Côte d’Azur in February 2013 and on January 30, 2014, respectively. Novescia
Aquitaine’s net sales contributions to Novescia for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013
were €4.0 million and €0.4 million, respectively, and its profit from recurring operations before amortization
and depreciation contributions to Novescia for the same periods were €0.6 million and €0.1 million,
respectively. Novescia Côte d’Azur’s net sales contributions to Novescia for the years ended December 31,
2012 and December 31, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were €12.3 million, €11.8 million
and €1.0 million, respectively, and its profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation
contributions to Novescia for the same periods were € 0.8 million, €0.4 million and €0.3 million, respectively. In
addition, the Pro Forma Financial Information does not make adjustments for intercompany sales between the
Company and its subsidiaries and Novescia. This, however, has no impact on profit from recurring operations
before amortization and depreciation as the excess sales are eliminated in consumption of materials and
supplies.

Notes:

(a) The consolidated income statement of the Company has been extracted from the audited consolidated financial statements of the
Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(b) The pro forma adjustments reflect:

(i) The acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2013 of company shares of Bio-Nord, CHB, Bastard, Stal and CBM, based
on their unaudited management accounts or unaudited management estimates, from January 1, 2013 to the date of inclusion in
the consolidation system. Management estimates are pro rata calculations derived from actual income statements, tax returns or
trial balances of the acquired companies for a prior period or for a larger period.

(ii) The acquisition of company shares of JS Management, Montbrun and JS Bio, based on their audited financial statements as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2013.

(iii) The disposal of company shares of Biotop Place Boulot based on its contribution to the audited consolidated financial statements
of the company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, from January 1, 2013 to the date of exclusion in the
consolidation system. The gain on disposal on its transaction, amounting to €799 thousand, is cancelled as Biotop Place Boulot is
considered as disposed prior to January 1, 2013.

(v) IFRS adjustments to the income statement information of the acquired companies and businesses, which was prepared under
French GAAP. These adjustments mainly relate to:

       - The accounting treatment of financial leases. Under French GAAP, lease contracts were recorded as operating lease. Under
IFRS these lease contracts have been recorded as finance lease;

       - The reclassification of the French value added business tax (CVAE). Under French GAAP, CVAE was reflected as part of
operating expenses. Under IFRS, as applied by Cerba, CVAE is presented as part of the income tax;

       - The reclassification of the French tax credit for encouraging competitiveness and jobs (CICE). Under French GAAP CICE
was reflected as a deduction of income tax expense. Under IFRS, CICE is reflected as a deduction to personnel expenses;

       - As part a result of the acquisition of JS Bio the following adjustment has been posted to the historical financial statements
of JS Bio to comply with IFRS: negative goodwill of €1,131 thousand recorded in historical financial statements of JS Bio
has been recorded as income. Under French GAAP, negative goodwill is amortized, whereas under IFRS goodwill it is not.

(v) The cancellation of transactional costs associated with acquisitions and disposals for a total of €681 thousand and related to
company shares and the businesses described above in (i) to (iii) as these transactions are considered to be completed on
January 1, 2013, and non-recurring in nature.

(vi) As a direct effect of the acquired companies and agreed in the term of transactions agreements, personnel expenses related to
biologists who disposed of their business are lower post acquisition. Decrease in biologist consideration has been applied as if in
place starting January 1, 2013. The impact is a decrease in personnel expenses of €560 thousand for the period.

(vii) As a result of the acquisition of JS Bio, operating expenses of €765 thousand related to the holding companies named JS
Management and Montbrun Bio and included in JS Bio historical financial statements have been cancelled. As these operating
expenses do not directly relate to JS Bio business, they are considered to be non-recurring.

(viii) The financing impact of the acquisition of JS Bio which consists of the cancellation of the financing in place prior to the
acquisition and reimbursed when JS Bio was acquired by Cerba . The impact is replaced by the estimated cost for the twelve
month period ended December 31, 2013 of net debt attached to the financial debt issued by Cerba in May 2014. The net impact
of these adjustments is an increase in cost of net debt by €4,198 thousand.

(c) The pro forma adjustments reflect the Acquisition based on the consolidated income statement of Novescia from the audited
consolidated financial statements of Novescia as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

The pro forma adjustments also include an adjustment to align Novescia’s and the Company’s accounting principles regarding lease
contracts: under the Company’s financial statements additional contracts are treated as financial leases whereas they are treated as operating
leases under Novescia’s financial statements. The impact of this adjustment is an increase in EBITDA by €2,105 thousand, with no impact
on result before tax.

(d) The pro forma adjustments reflect the estimated impact under IFRS for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013 of financial
debt to be issued by Cerba to acquire Novescia mentioned in the section “Sources and uses” of this Offering Memorandum.

(e) “Non recurring items” include other operating income and expenses such as: (i) acquisition costs related to a large merger and
acquisition project not realized by Cerba (€1,197 thousand), (ii) the gain on disposal of Novescia Aquitaine (€1,250 thousand) and
(iii) restructuring costs of Novescia (€3,600 thousand).

Notes:

(a) The unaudited income statement for the last twelve months ended September 30, 2014 has been calculated by adding the Company’s
audited consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the Company’s unaudited income statement for the
nine months ended September 30, 2014 and subtracting the Company’s unaudited income statement for the nine months ended
September 30, 2013.

(b) The pro forma adjustments reflect:

(i) the acquisition in the last quarter of 2013 of company shares of CBM, Bastard and Stal based on their unaudited management

Management estimates are pro rata calculations derived from actual income statements, tax returns or trial balances of the
acquired companies for a prior period or for a larger period.

(ii) the acquisition in 2014 of company shares of JS Management, Montbrun Bio and JS Bio, based on their unaudited management
accounts or unaudited management estimates, from October 1, 2013 to the date of inclusion in the consolidation system
following the same methodology as for the acquisitions described above in (i).

(iii) For each of these acquisitions listed in (i) and (ii), the unaudited consolidated income statement for the last twelve months ended
September 30, 2014 has been calculated by adding the unaudited or audited consolidated income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2013 and unaudited consolidated income statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and subtracting
the Company’s unaudited consolidated income statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.

(iv) IFRS adjustments to the income statement information of the acquired companies and businesses, which was prepared under
French GAAP. These adjustments mainly relate to the accounting treatment of financial leases, the reclassification of the French
value added business tax (CVAE) within income tax instead of operating expense.

(v) the cancellation of acquisition costs recorded by Cerba’s entities of €1,502 thousand and related to company shares and the
businesses described above in (i) and (ii) as these transactions are considered to be completed on October 1, 2013, and
non-recurring in nature.

(vi) As a result of the acquisition of JS Bio, operating expenses of €454 thousand related to holding entities named JS Management

**Management’s discussion and analysis of financial**
**condition and results of operations**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the_
_nine months ended September 30, 2014 and as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013._
_The following should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information,” “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information, Pro Forma and Other Data”_
_and the consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the notes thereto, an English_
_translation of which is included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

_The following discussion includes forward-looking statements based on assumptions about our future_
_performance. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those described under “Forward- Looking_
_Statements,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**Introduction**

We are a leading European clinical pathology laboratory, providing routine and specialized clinical laboratory
testing services primarily in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, and supporting pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies worldwide in the clinical trial phase of their drug development processes.

Through our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations, we offer a range of over 2,500 routine and
specialty clinical tests used by doctors and medical institutions to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases. We
generally perform clinical tests using automated testing equipment, quickly delivering results to doctors,
hospitals and patients and offering specialized assistance with respect to interpretation of results. Through a
large network of high quality laboratories in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, our Routine Lab operations
perform a wide variety of clinical tests (including blood chemistry analyses, urinalyses, blood cell counts and
microbiology cultures and procedures) for patients who have generally been prescribed these tests by their
doctors. Our Specialized Testing operations offer private laboratories and public hospitals a broad range of
specialty testing services, such as molecular biology testing, oncology testing, allergy testing, hormonology
testing, infectious disease testing and diagnostic genetic testing. While French private laboratories and public
hospitals represent the largest share of our Specialized Testing customer base (91% of our Specialized Testing
net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2014), we also offer our services to hospitals or laboratories
based elsewhere in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The prices of a large majority of the clinical tests
that we offer in our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses are set by the respective government
authorities of the countries in which we operate.

Our Central Lab testing operations, which we operate through our BARC subsidiaries, provide safety and
efficacy testing services to pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations worldwide in
connection with drug development processes. We leverage our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing facilities
and expertise to develop testing protocols with our clients and to provide a range of safety, efficacy,
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic testing.

As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately 2,617 full-time equivalent employees and we employed
approximately 221 clinical pathologists. Over the course of our history, we have developed our business through
strategic acquisitions of regional laboratories, such as our acquisitions of JS Bio, Biotop, Biolille and
Bioréunion, as well as through selective purchases of larger testing platforms for access to new markets, such as
our acquisitions of LLAM in Luxembourg in 2011 and BARC in Belgium in 2007.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated pro forma net sales of €575.2 million and
Adjusted pro forma EBITDA (including Novescia synergies) of €136.8 million. See “Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial Information, Pro Forma (including Novescia synergies) and Other Data—Other_
_Financial, Pro Forma and Operating Data.”_

**Factors that affect our results of operations**

You should consider the following factors when analyzing our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Demand for laboratory tests_**

Our revenue is directly related to the volume of tests we perform. Demographic trends, including the growing
size of the elderly segment of the population, the increase in soft diseases such as allergies, and the growth of

86


-----

long-term diseases such as cancer and diabetes requiring recurrent tests are contributing to increased demand for
our services. Testing volumes have also increased as the medical profession focuses on the prevention and early
detection and treatment of chronic and severe illnesses and increasingly relies on clinical testing for
more-accurate diagnoses, which also leads to the development of new tests. In addition, the greater health
consciousness of the general public along with increased disposable income contributes to both volume growth
and a willingness of certain patients to absorb out-of-pocket costs. In addition, outsourcing from hospital
laboratories of specialty tests has increased due mainly to public spending cuts in the countries where we
operate. Increase in demand for tests we provide is however mitigated by the routinization of specialized testing
by laboratories that previously outsourced tests to our Specialty Testing business. This occurs for example when
technology for certain tests progresses and leads to the development of more cost-effective tests that can be
performed by routine laboratories or when the demand for the test is such that it becomes cost-efficient for
routine laboratories to perform it. We experienced this in 2012 when the testing of vitamin D levels was
insourced. Demand is also tempered by the decrease in the number of tests prescribed by doctors, mainly in
France, as they face pressure from governmental agencies to reduce prescriptions for certain tests.

**_Regulated tariffs for laboratory testing_**

We mainly operate in countries (France, Belgium and Luxembourg) and in market segments (Routine and
Specialized laboratory testing) where clinical laboratory testing services are paid through publicly funded
healthcare programs with regulated tariffs. Tariffs are set by governments and healthcare authorities and we
have no control over the prices we charge to our clients. In addition, in the countries where we operate, we are
not allowed to propose additional paid services to our professional or non-professional clients.

With 57.6% and 24.0% of our total net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 generated from
our Routine Lab business and from our Specialized Testing business, respectively, in industries where tariffs are
regulated, we consider that approximately 88% of our consolidated net sales to be generated from regulated
tariffs for the same period.

Since 2009, European governments, including the governments of France and Belgium, have been
implementing austerity measures aimed at reducing government expenditures, including in healthcare. These
measures encompass both tariff decreases and measures aimed at limiting testing volume growth overall. In
France, efforts have been underway to reduce tariffs for clinical laboratory tests. Based on government targeted
annual savings in French clinical pathology expenditures of approximately €100 million (resulting from the
Ballereau report issued in 2008), and actual savings of €72 million in 2013 alone, tariffs in the French private
clinical laboratory market declined by 4.3% and 2.6% in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Additionally, tariffs
generally (including regulated and non-regulated tariffs) in the French Lab market have declined at a compound
annual growth rate of 1.1% between 2007 and 2012, according to the “Rapport de la Cour des Comptes.”
Similar efforts to control health expenditures are also being made in Belgium, where, in addition to regulated
tariffs, the government defines each year a global spending limit on clinical laboratory tests, which incentivizes
doctors and patients to limit volumes. In view of reducing public health expenditures, the Belgian government
also reduced fixed-fees for ambulatory care (clinical biology) by approximately 7.5%, including for laboratory
tests performed by extra-hospital laboratories, such as ours (see Royal Decree of October 18, 2013 amending the
Royal Decree of 24 September 1992 laying down the procedures for fixed fee for certain clinical laboratory
services provided to ambulatory patients, as well as the outsourcing of these services; and Administrative
Circular OA n° 2013/351 of October 30, 2013, Administrative Circular OA n° 2013/463 of December 24, 2013,
Administrative Circular OA n° 2014/228 of May 28, 2014 and Administrative Circular OA n° 2014/507 of
December 23, 2014). In the wake of continued economic and financial instability as well as increased pressure
on public spending in Europe, we expect further tariff decreases in the countries where we operate, particularly
France.

**_General economic conditions and reimbursement levels_**

Although the clinical laboratory services market is generally considered to be less sensitive to economic cycles
than certain other markets, we believe that a weakening of overall economic conditions may have a negative
impact on our results of operations. Although we operate in countries where laboratory tests are largely paid for
by healthcare programs, deterioration of economic conditions have led and will likely continue to lead
governments to seek to reduce healthcare expenditure growth, which increases pressure on prices and volumes
for our services. In addition, in France, our main market, public healthcare programs financed approximately
70% of the spending in the French private clinical pathology testing market in 2010, and customers are directly
or indirectly (such as through private health insurance premiums) responsible for the remainder of that cost. As
a result, individual decisions to reduce out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures may result in reduced demand for

87


-----

our services. More broadly, a general diminution of disposable income, or the perception thereof in times of
economic downturn, can lead to a reduction in individuals’ health expenditures, regardless of the level of
reimbursements by public social security systems or private insurance.

**_Expansion of our laboratory network through acquisitions_**

We have expanded our network of clinical laboratories, and intend to continue to expand, through acquisitions.
Historically, we have mainly focused on acquisitions of small and medium-sized regional laboratories in France
to strengthen our network in the regions where we are already present through regional clusters. While we focus
on small bolt-on acquisitions, we have also made certain larger strategic acquisitions to expand our geographic
presence or enter new segments. For example, in 2007, we expanded our geographical reach and business mix
through the acquisition of BARC in Belgium, thereby entering the central lab and Belgian routine market. In
May 2014, we completed the acquisition of JS Bio to complement our position in the south east region of
France. In the years December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we
completed 21, 8, 6 and 1 acquisitions, respectively, for aggregate cash consideration of € 142.2 million,
€25.0 million, €33.3 million and € 55.8 million, respectively.

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. First, our results for the period during which an
acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our consolidated
results. Acquisitions made since January 1, 2011 contributed on a cumulative basis 25.1%, 29.7%, 32.7% and
36.0% of the net sales of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. In addition, the results of the acquired businesses after their
acquisition may be impacted positively by synergies. For example, the businesses we have acquired in the past,
particularly the small bolt-on acquisitions, have generally generated savings on reagent purchases, technical and
administrative expenses within a short period after their acquisition and have realized savings on personnel
expenses over a longer period of time. For larger strategic acquisitions, we may experience a temporary increase
in investments and personnel expenses as we integrate the acquired business into our network. Finally, because
acquired businesses are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, the full impact of an acquisition is only
reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period.

On December 19, 2014, we entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company
submitted a binding, irrevocable offer to acquire the Target Group through its indirect subsidiary Cerba Selafa.
Novescia is a clinical laboratory group active in the Rhône-Alpes region of the south-east of France. The
strategic rationale of the Acquisition is to create a new presence in the Rhône-Alpes region encompassing Lyon,
the second-largest city in France, which will allow us to gain broader geographical coverage in our core French
market and to strengthen our business with private hospitals, a significant source of business for Novescia. The
Acquisition will also increase the size of our presence in the broader Paris/Île-de-France region to make us a
leader in the region. Management further estimates that, as a result of the Acquisition, our consolidated business
operations will achieve cost synergies of approximately €10 million on a run rate basis by mid-2016, primarily
relating to the shifting of a portion of the testing activities carried out by Novescia onto the Company’s
platforms, the planned reduction of administrative costs associated with Novescia’s headquarters and the
realization of procurement synergies by integrating and leveraging our combined scale. However, this synergy
estimate is based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and
management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are
inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit
estimates. We believe that we will have to make capital expenditures and/or incur one-off costs of
approximately €8 million to achieve such cost synergies. Please see “Forward-Looking Statements.”

Because of the nature of the businesses we acquire, we carry a significant amount of goodwill on our balance
sheet (€686.0 million as of September 30, 2014). Goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually and
whenever there are indications of impairment. We may record significant charges in our income statement in
case of impairment under IFRS.

We intend to further expand our network by continuing to acquire laboratories in each of the markets where we
currently operate and selectively explore opportunities to purchase existing laboratory networks in other
European countries.

**_Changes in regulation_**

Our business is subject to, and impacted by, extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in each of
the countries in which we operate as well as at the European Union level. See “Regulation.” In particular, until
2010, consolidation was strictly regulated in the French market, by limitations placed on the number of clinical
laboratories that could be operated by a single laboratory company. In addition, limitations on outsourcing and
minimum levels of staffing generated operational inefficiencies in that market. Some of these constraints have
recently become less stringent: restrictions on the number of clinical laboratories that may be owned and
operated by the same laboratory company have been softened, paving the way for market consolidation.
However, outsourcing of tests between clinical laboratories is still limited, and minimum staffing requirements
remain. Consolidation has also been affected by national labor laws that reduce flexibility to reduce our
workforce.

In France, the establishment and operation of clinical laboratories requires administrative authorization from
local health authorities and compliance with certain standards set by law. The existing authorization process will
be gradually replaced, from November 1, 2016, by a procedure of mandatory accreditation (applicable with
steps on November 1, 2016, November 1, 2018 and November 1, 2020), and stricter standards (ISO: 15189) to
obtain such accreditation have been introduced. Although implementing these stricter standards will be costly
and time consuming, we believe that we are better prepared than our smaller competitors to comply with such
heightened requirements. We believe that smaller laboratory companies may be unable to obtain the applicable
accreditations and may be forced to close or to pursue mergers or consolidate with larger groups such as ours.

For a detailed discussion of the regulatory risks that we are facing, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business—We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may_
_face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be negatively impacted if we fail to comply”_
and “Regulation.”

**_Sensitivity of our cost structure_**

Our cost base is largely fixed, with only consumption of materials and supplies (consisting mainly of reagent
purchases and outsourced tests), certain external expenses and a small portion of personnel expenses considered
fully variable. Personnel expense, which represented 35.2% of the net sales of the Company for the nine months
ended September 30, 2014, is largely fixed due in part to national labor laws limiting workforce reductions and
requiring the presence of at least one clinical pathologist in every lab. We believe that we can generally reduce
personnel expenses, within a two-year period, through the creation of regional clusters by converting acquired
laboratories into collection centers and through mergers of laboratories, which allows us to redeploy staff more
efficiently and achieve savings on technical and administrative expenses. We have already consolidated a
substantial portion of our operations in Belgium and are in the process of doing so in France, where recent
regulatory changes now allow us to reduce staffing levels and insource the performance of tests among clinical
laboratories to technical platforms operated by the same laboratory company.

**_Cyclicality of the Central Lab business_**

Revenues derived from our Central Lab business depend on the expenditures made by our clients, generally
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in research and development. The economic downturn has
increased the risk associated with conducting our Central Lab business as economic difficulties result in
budgetary constraints on our clients’ research and development projects. Companies in these industries,
particularly smaller biotechnology companies, are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their
research and development projects. As a result, they may not be able to obtain access to credit or equity funding,
which could affect their ability to engage in new trial testing projects, complete existing trials following the
initial timetable for trials, or make timely payments to us for projects already launched. In addition to volume
reductions, the economic climate may result in downward pressure on prices and therefore margins. Decreases
in research and development spending, or the perception thereof in times of economic downturn, can lead to a
reduction in our clients’ trial testing expenditure and pressure for improved terms. Accordingly, economic
factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business. We believe that we
benefit from some downside protection as our Central Lab business leverages the infrastructure of our Routine
and Specialized Testing business, which share the burden of fixed costs associated with the business.
Nonetheless, changes in the number of research and development projects our clients conduct or outsource, or
their effort to obtain improved terms, affect revenues and profitability.

**Key income statement items**

Below is a summary description of the key elements of the IFRS line items of the income statements for the
Company.

**_Net sales corresponds to sales of our testing services provided directly to patients, outsourced to us by hospitals_**
and other private laboratories, or provided to the pharmaceutical industry in connection with our clinical trial
activities. Net sales consists of revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities, measures the
fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual volume
discounts for hospitals. Revenue related to analyses/tests carried out in connection with routine and specialized
clinical testing is recognized when the report is validated by the clinical pathologist (which is the date results are
communicated to the client). For our Central Lab business, clinical trials are governed by contractual
arrangements and revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, measured on the basis of
work performed.

**_Cost of sales/Consumption of materials and supplies primarily includes our costs for the reagents we purchase_**
from suppliers and for tests we outsource to other clinical laboratories.

**_Other purchases and external expenses includes mainly third-party transport expenses, consumables, utilities,_**
laboratory leases, operating leases, maintenance costs, post and telecommunication expenses, fees to external
service providers, including audit, accounting, legal, human resources and marketing fees, insurance, security,
cleaning, vehicle rental and travel expenses.

**_Personnel expenses principally include wages and salaries, compulsory social security contributions,_**
post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits and employee profit sharing. Personnel expenses also
include costs associated with the use of subcontractors and non-salaried personnel.

**_Net change in depreciation, amortization and impairment includes regular depreciation and amortization of_**
non-current assets such as intangible assets, buildings, laboratory equipment, computers and software. When
applicable, it also includes impairment of goodwill. It also includes provisions for operational risks, disputes,
pensions, bad debt and overdue receivables.

**_Other operating income and expenses principally includes miscellaneous income and expenses not related to_**
the operation of our clinical laboratories.

**_Net financial income (expense) is financial income, net of financial expense. Financial expense primarily_**
includes interest and related expense, interest on bank loans, interest on bonds issued to shareholders,
commitment fees, swap-related finance costs and accrued interest and related expenses.

**_Income tax includes corporate tax paid on income (in France, “impôt sur les bénéfices”) and deferred taxes; it_**
does not include other taxes due by us, which are recorded under the line item “Taxes and duties” in our IFRS
income statement.

**Results of operations**

_Net sales_

Our total net sales increased by €34.9 million, or 13.4%, from € 259.5 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013 to € 294.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

This increase was primarily due to the full-year effect of the net sales generated by the businesses acquired
during the fiscal year 2013 (in particular CBM and CHB in France) for a total of €11.5 million, as well as the
net sales generated by businesses acquired during the fiscal year 2014 (in particular JS Bio in France,
contributing from June 1, 2014), for a total of €15.1 million.

Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, net sales on a like for like basis increased by €8.3 million or 3.2%
between the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, due to
volume growth, partially offset by price decreases, particularly in Belgium and France.

This organic growth was primarily due to the Specialized Lab business (an increase of €7.7 million, or 8.0%)
due to gains of market shares and new revenue stream from innovative tests or services. Net sales from our
Central Lab business also increased by €3.9 million, or 12.7%. Organic sales from our Routine Lab France
increased by €2.8 million or 3.4%. Sales from our Routine Lab Belux decreased by €3.8 million or (6.4)% due
to tariff cuts in Belgium and increased commercial competition in Flanders. The balance is explained by the
movement in intercompany sales.

_Cost of sales/consumption of materials and supplies_

Cost of sales/consumption of materials and supplies decreased by €7.8 million, or 13.9%, from €56.3 million in
the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to €48.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

This decrease was mainly attributable to a change in the classification of operating expenses in the Company’s
Q3 2014 IFRS Financial Statements: transportation costs associated with the Central Lab activity were
previously recorded as a component of “Cost of sales/Consumption of materials and supplies”; they are now
classified with all other transportation costs of the Company within “Other purchases and external expenses”.
Such transportation costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 amounted to €9.3 million.

Cost of sales/consumption of materials and supplies adjusted for this item amounted to €47.1 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2013, compared to €48.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
This 3.1% increase was mainly attributable to the full year effect of the cost of sales/consumption of materials

-----

and supplies incurred by the businesses acquired in 2013 and fiscal year 2014, together with the organic growth
in both our Routine Lab and Specialized Lab businesses.

Gross margin adjusted for this change in classification increased across the two periods from 81.8% in the nine
months ended September 30, 2013 to 83.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This mostly reflects
(i) the application of Cerba tariffs to acquired labs and (ii) improvement in our purchasing conditions and
efficiencies in testing processes.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €11.3 million, or 19.2%, from €59.0 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2013 to €70.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, mainly due to
the change in the classification of operating expenses in the Company’s Q3 2014 IFRS Financial Statements:
transportation costs associated with the Central Lab activity were previously recorded as a component of “Cost
of sales/Consumption of materials and supplies”; they are now classified with all other transportation costs of
the Company within “Other purchases and external expenses”. Such transportation costs for the nine months
ended September 30, 2013 amounted to €9.3 million.

Other purchases and external expenses of materials and supplies adjusted for this item amounted to
€68.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to €70.3 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2014. This 2.9% increase was mainly attributable to the full year effect of the other
purchases and external expenses incurred by the businesses acquired in 2013 and fiscal year 2014, together with
the organic growth in both our Routine Lab and Specialized Lab businesses.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by €21.9 million, or 26.8%, from € 81.6 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013 to € 103.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, mainly due to the impact
of the personnel expenses incurred by the businesses acquired in fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014.

Personnel expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly from 31.4% in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013 to 35.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This mainly reflects (i) recent
acquisitions in our Routine Lab France sector, which are traditionally labor-intensive and have not yet delivered
all their potential for cost savings and efficiencies, and (ii) the reinforcement of headquarters support functions
(e.g. process and engineering, IT, financial control) aimed at integrating acquired laboratories and implementing
synergies.

_Net change in depreciation and amortization_

Net change in depreciation and amortization decreased by €1.2 million, from €20.9 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2013 to €19.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

_Goodwill impairment_

We did not incur a goodwill impairment charge in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 or in the nine
months ended September 30, 2014.

_Net financial income (expense)_

Net financial expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 mainly relates to the interest on the Existing
Senior Secured Notes in the amount of €22.7 million.

Net financial expense increased by €4.9 million between the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and the
nine months ended September 30, 2014, of which €3.7 million is due to the €80 million additional notes issued
in April, 2014 but accruing interest since February 1, 2014.

_Income tax_

Income tax expense increased by €1.8 million, from €9.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013
to €11.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, mainly driven by an increase in taxable earnings.

_Net sales_

Our total net sales increased by €25.8 million, or 7.9%, from €325.8 million in fiscal year 2012 to
€351.6 million in fiscal year 2013.

This increase was primarily due to the full year effect of the net sales generated by the businesses acquired
during the fiscal year 2012 (in particular Notre-Dame in France) for a total of €11.4 million, as well as the net
sales generated by businesses acquired during the fiscal year 2013 (in particular CHB in France), for a total of
€2.6 million, partially offset by the sale of a non-strategic business for €0.6 million.

Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, net sales on a like for like basis increased by €11.8 million or 3.6%
between fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013, corresponding to €7.0 million from our Routine Lab and
Specialized Lab businesses and €4.8 million from our Central Lab business, partially offset by price decreases,
particularly in France.

This organic growth was primarily due to the Specialized Lab business (an increase of €8.9 million, or 7.3%)
due to gains of market shares. Net sales from our Central Lab business also increased by €4.8 million, or 12.7%.
Over the same period, our Routine Lab business in Belgium and Luxembourg increased by €1.2 million or
1.6%, and our Routine Lab business in France increased by €0.5 million, or 0.5%, as a result of organic growth.
The balance is explained by the movement in intercompany sales.

_Cost of sales/consumption of materials and supplies_

Cost of sales/Consumption of materials and supplies increased by € 3.4 million, or 4.7%, from €72.3 million in
fiscal year 2012 to €75.7 million in fiscal year 2013.

93


-----

This increase was mainly attributable to the full year effect of the Cost of sales/Consumption of materials and
supplies incurred by the businesses acquired in 2012 and fiscal year 2013, together with the organic growth in
both our Routine Lab and Specialized Lab businesses.

Gross margin increased across the two periods from 77.8% in fiscal year 2012 to 78.5% in fiscal year 2013. This
mostly reflects (i) the application of Cerba tariffs to acquired labs and (ii) improvement in Group’s purchasing
conditions and testing processes.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses decreased by €5.4 million, or 7.0%, from €78.4 million in fiscal year
2012 to €73.0 million in fiscal year 2013, mainly due to the one-off fees and commissions paid in 2012 related
to raising new capex credit lines, for a total of €5.7 million.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by €8.2 million, or 7.6%, from €108.1 million in fiscal year 2012 to
€116.3 million in fiscal year 2013, mainly due the full-year impact of the personnel expenses incurred by the
businesses acquired in fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013.

Personnel expenses as a percentage of sales remained overall stable between the two periods from 33.2% in
fiscal year 2012 to 33.1% in fiscal year 2013. This reflects (i) a strict monitoring of personnel costs in the
various business units, partly offset by (ii) the reinforcement of headquarters support functions (e.g. process and
engineering, IT, financial control) aimed at integrating acquired laboratories and implementing synergies.

_Net change in depreciation and amortization_

Net change in depreciation and amortization increased by €1.2 million, from €23.9 million in fiscal year 2012 to
€25.1 million in fiscal year 2013, mainly due to the impact of the acquisitions made in 2012 and 2013.

_Goodwill impairment_

We did not incur a goodwill impairment charge in 2013.

_Net financial income (expense)_

Net financial expense in 2013 mainly relates to the €365 million senior secured notes issued in January,
including interest of €23.7 million and amortization of the bond issuance costs of €1.9 million.

Net financial expense decreased by €20.4 million between fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013. This is mainly
due to the conversion of the majority of the convertible bond into share capital occurred in December 2012
(€158.1 million of capital increase). These convertible bonds used to bear interest rate of 10% a year.

_Income tax_

Income tax expense decreased by €3.8 million, from €15.7 million in fiscal year 2012 to €12.0 million in fiscal
year 2013.

This results from deferred tax items, which varied from an expense of €1.8 million in fiscal year 2012 to an
income of €2.6 million in fiscal year 2013. Current tax expense slightly increased, from €13.9 million in fiscal
year 2012 to €14.5 million in fiscal year 2013, mainly driven by an increase of taxable earnings.

_Net sales_

Our total net sales increased by €47.1 million, or 16.9%, from €278.7 million in fiscal year 2011 to
€325.8 million in fiscal year 2012.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in net sales of our Routine Lab business of €54.0 million, which
itself was mainly attributable to the net sales generated by businesses acquired during the fiscal year 2012 (in
particular LABM de Larrard in France) for a total of €8.8 million, as well as the full year effect of the net sales
generated by the businesses acquired during the fiscal year 2011 (in particular LLAM in Luxembourg and
MedicLab in Belgium) for a total of €40.0 million. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions made during these
periods, net sales of our Routine Lab business across France, Belgium and Luxembourg increased by
€5.2 million between fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2012, due to volume growth, partially offset by price
decreases, particularly in France.

The increase in net sales of Routine Lab business was partially offset by a slight decrease in net sales of
Specialized Testing of €1.7 million, mainly due to the decrease of vitamin D testing (impact −€ 2.8 million)
attributable to the insourcing of such tests by routine laboratories following the development of a simplified test
for vitamin D and overall price decreases. However this shift from Specialized to Routine has now come to an
end, and we no longer derive net sales from vitamin D testing in our Specialized Lab business unit. Excluding
vitamin D, revenue from our Specialized Testing unit increased by €1.2 million or 1.0%.

Net sales from our Central Lab business decreased by €3.0 million, or 7.3%, due to adverse market conditions
with several trials cancelled or slowed down. However some projects were postponed to fiscal year 2013.

_Cost of sales/consumption of materials and supplies_

Cost of sales/Consumption of materials and supplies increased by €5.5 million, or 8.2%, from €66.8 million in
fiscal year 2011 to €72.3 million in fiscal year 2012.

95


-----

This increase in Cost of sales/Consumption of materials and supplies was mainly attributable to the Cost of
sales/Consumption of materials and supplies incurred by the businesses acquired during the fiscal year 2012, as
well as the full year effect of the Cost of sales/Consumption of materials and supplies incurred by the businesses
acquired in the fiscal year 2011.

Gross margin increased across the two periods from 76.0% in fiscal year 2011 to 77.8% in fiscal year 2012. This
mostly reflects (i) the application of Cerba tariffs to acquired labs and (ii) improvement in Group’s purchasing
conditions and testing processes.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €15.7 million, or 24.8%, from €62.8 million in fiscal year
2011 to €78.4 million in fiscal year 2012, mainly due to businesses acquired in the fiscal year 2012 for
€1.6 million, as well as the full year effect of the other purchases and external expenses incurred by the
businesses acquired in fiscal year 2011, together with the one-off fees and commissions paid in 2012 related to
raising new capex credit lines for a total of €5.7 million.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by €18.7 million, or 20.9%, from €89.4 million in fiscal year 2011 to
€108.1 million in fiscal year 2012, mainly due to personnel expenses incurred by the businesses acquired in
2012, together with the full period impact of the personnel expenses incurred by the businesses acquired in
2011. The remaining increase in personnel expenses over the period was due to the legal and contractual salary
increases in our different geographies.

Personnel expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 32.1% to 33.2% between 2011 and 2012 reflecting
(i) the large number of acquisitions completed in the year ended December 31, 2011 and personnel of the
acquired businesses yet to be redeployed across the platforms, together with (ii) the reinforcement of
headquarters support functions (e.g. process and engineering, IT and financial control) aimed at integrating
acquired laboratories and implementing synergies.

As of December 31, 2012, we had 2,110 full-time equivalent employees compared to 1,569 as of December 31,
2011.

_Net change in depreciation, amortization and impairment_

Net change in depreciation and amortization increased by €2.6 million, from €21.3 million in fiscal year 2011 to
€23.9 million in fiscal year 2012, mainly due to the impact of the acquisitions made in 2011 and 2012.

A goodwill impairment charge of €48.5 million was recorded in fiscal year 2012. In 2012, we identified
indicators of impairment losses in respect of the business unit for our Specialized Testing business. We tested
for impairment using a revised 2.00% assumed growth rate. This growth rate was decreased from 2.50% based
on market developments and the Specialized Testing business’s competitive position.

_Net financial income (expense)_

Net financial expense increased by €14.8 million between fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2012. This is mainly
due to the accelerated depreciation of capitalized debt issuance costs for €11.6 million. As of December 31,
2012, we considered that the issuance of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the related refinancing
transactions were highly probable, therefore the unamortized portion of the transaction costs related to the
previous financing incurred in 2010 was fully expensed into our income statement.

Net financial expense also includes non-cash capitalized interest on shareholder loans for €16.9 million.

_Income tax_

Income tax increased by €8.4 million, from €7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to €15.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2012. However this mainly results from deferred tax items, which varied from
an income of €7.0 million in fiscal year 2011 to an expense of €1.8 million in fiscal year 2012. Current tax
expense remained broadly constant, from €14.3 million in fiscal year 2011 to €13.9 million in fiscal year 2012.

**Liquidity and capital resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of
its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures,
contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are
provided by our cash from operating activities and our financings. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily to
fund acquisitions, to meet our debt services obligations, working capital and, to a lesser extent, to fund capital
expenditures.

Our financial condition and liquidity is and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including:

- our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

- the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, and the interest we are
obligated to pay on such indebtedness, which affects our net financial expense;

- our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to continue to borrow funds from financial institutions; and

- our external growth funding requirements, which consist primarily of the funding of acquisitions of
additional laboratories.

Our cash requirements consist mainly of the following:

- funding acquisitions;

- funding working capital requirements;

- funding capital expenditures needs;

- servicing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries;

- operating activities; and

- paying taxes.

Our sources of liquidity will consist mainly of the following:

- cash generated from our operating activities;

- borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility;

- borrowings under debt securities;

- borrowings under factoring and bilateral loan facilities; and

- capital contributions from our shareholders.

**_Consolidated IFRS cash flow statement_**

The following table summarizes our IFRS consolidated cash flow statement for the nine months ended
September 30, 2013 and 2014 based on the Company’s Q3 2014 IFRS financial statements and for the years

_Cash flow from (used in) operating activities_

Cash flow from operating activities increased by €1.6 million from €41.5 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013 to €43.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This derived from an
increase profit from operating activities by €4.9 million partly offset by an increase of income tax paid by
€2.6 million and an increase of change in working capital by €0.8 million

Cash flow from operating activities increased by €30.7 million from €37.6 million in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2012 to €68.3 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. This mainly derived from
an increase in EBITDA by € 14.8 million, together with a €12.1 million increase from change in working
capital, mainly through an improvement in the trade receivables collection cycle.

Cash flow from operating activities decreased by €6.3 million from €43.9 million in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2011 to €37.6 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. This mainly derived from
an increase in working capital of €7.7 million mainly due to higher receivables in the Specialized Lab Business,
where the invoicing process was subject to new rules in the course of 2012 which required specialized
laboratories to invoice routine laboratories from which the specialized tests were outsourced, instead of
invoicing patients directly. Routine laboratories complied with this arrangement only gradually, which delayed
our collection of payments and adversely affected our cash flows. Income tax paid also increased by
€2.7 million between the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and the twelve months ended December 31,
2012 at €10.3 million and €12.9 million, respectively.

_Cash flow from (used in) investing activities_

Cash flow used in investing activities increased from €22.7 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2013 to €70.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 mainly due to investment in acquisitions
from €15.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to €64.9 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 (JS Bio Group for €55.8 million being the largest purchases) and to the repurchase of some
minority ownership interests of €10.8 million (Biotop and Biolille). Our operating capital expenditures,
excluding acquisitions, decreased by €2,5 million mainly due the decrease of need to upgrade our technical
platforms and to convert small labs into collection centers.

Cash flow used in investing activities increased from €27.8 million in the twelve months ended December 31,
2012 to €47.1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. This was primarily due to investment in
acquisitions, from €20.4 million in fiscal year 2012 to €38.5 million in fiscal year 2013. Our operating capital

98


-----

expenditures, excluding acquisitions, remained broadly stable between the two periods, at €9.9 million in fiscal
year 2012 and €8.9 million in fiscal year 2013 or 2.5% of 2013 revenue.

Cash flow used in investing activities decreased from a use of €147.8 million in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2011 to a use of €27.8 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to
the decrease in investment in acquisitions, from €138.0 million in fiscal year 2011 (LLAM in Luxembourg and
LABM de Larrard in France being the largest purchases) to €20.4 million in fiscal year 2012. This decrease was
partly offset by a €0.9 million increase in operating capital expenditures (i.e. property, plant and equipment), the
majority being due to investments made in newly acquired businesses in order to upgrade technical platforms
and to convert small labs into collection centers.

_Cash flow from (used in) financing activities_

Cash flow from financing activities increased by €3.2 million between the nine months ended September 30,
2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, from €16.7 million to €19.9 million, respectively. This
mainly derived from the sources and uses of funds of the bonds refinancing transaction occurred in January
2013 compared to the sources and uses of funds of the tap of the bonds to purchase the JS BIO group in May
2014.

Cash flow from financing activities increased by €10.1 million between fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013,
from a cash outflow of €1.1 million to a cash inflow of €9.0 million, respectively. This mainly derived from the
sources and uses of funds of the bond refinancing transaction occurred in January 2013.

Cash flow from financing activities decreased from a cash inflow of €101.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011, to a cash outflow of €1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Main variances are
as follows:

- Debt service payments (i.e. principal and interest payments on our financial debts) slightly decreased from
€33.2 million in fiscal year 2011 to €31.7 million in fiscal year 2012;

- Proceeds from new indebtedness and equity contributions decreased from €135.4 million in fiscal year 2011
to €30.7 million in fiscal year 2012. The significant amount raised in fiscal year 2011 was aimed at funding
the large acquisition program of that year.

**_Capital expenditures_**

Our net capital expenditures, excluding asset acquisitions, for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and
2013 were €5.2 million and €8.0 million, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011 were €8.9 million, €9.9 million and €8.7 million, respectively. The slight decrease reflects less investment
compared to the improvements of investments done over the past years in France in order to upgrade technical
platforms and to convert small labs into collection centers.

We expect our capital expenditures, excluding asset acquisitions, to be approximately €10.8 million in the year
ended December 31, 2014 mostly related ancillary laboratory equipment and fixtures and fittings. We expect the
ratio of our net sales to our capital expenditures, excluding asset acquisitions, for the year ending December 31,
2015 to be in line with prior recent years.

**Capital resources**

As of September 30, 2014, we had net financial debt of €459.4 million (represents total debt, net of cash and
cash equivalents, excluding shareholder debt (see “Capitalization”) and accrued and unpaid interest on the
Existing Notes) composed of the Existing Notes and other financial liabilities (including primarily bilateral bank
loans, factoring and finance lease liabilities). We define net financial debt as borrowings and other financial
liabilities and cash and cash equivalents.

We expect cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility to be our
principal sources of funds. Future drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will be available only if, among
other things, we comply with the financial and other covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to
meet the financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will depend on our results of
operations, which may be affected by factors outside our control. For more information about the Revolving
Credit Facility, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”

The Senior Notes Issuer has obligations in respect of the Frenchco CPECs, which, as of September 30, 2014 as
adjusted for the conversion of the majority of the Frenchco CPECs to equity of the Senior Notes Issuer, were
€3.7 million, all of which is due in more than five years from such date.

Our new Revolving Credit Facility Agreement was not drawn on the Temporary Notes Issue Date.

**Off-balance sheet commitments**

We are a party to various customary off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees and security granted
in connection with earn-out obligation when businesses are acquired. See note 6.25 to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s interim IFRS Financial Statements at September 30, 2014 included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**Financial risk management**

We have historically been exposed to limited foreign exchange risk, as in the past we have entered into limited
foreign currency transactions.

We have in the past been exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. To manage this risk,
we have entered into hedging transactions and use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the adverse
effects of this risk.

We are not required to enter into hedging transactions or to use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the
adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and do not plan
to do so.

We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We do not apply hedge
accounting under IFRS.

**Critical accounting policies and estimates**

IFRS require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the relevant period.
These estimates and assumptions are based on the information available at the time of preparation of the
financial statements and affect the published amounts. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**_IFRS critical accounting policies and estimates_**

We consider the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the assumptions and
judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements in accordance with IFRS and the uncertainties
that could affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flows:

- consolidation methods;

100


-----

- recognition of revenue associated with clinical laboratory testing operations and clinical trials;

- accounting for deferred and income taxes;

- accounting for provisions and for impairment of financial assets;

- accounting for and impairment of goodwill;

- accounting for derivative financial instruments; and

- accounting for employee benefits.

A more detailed description of the accounting rules and methods that we apply under IFRS is provided in the
notes to the historical audited consolidated financial statements of Financière Gaillon 12 included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum.

_Consolidation methods_

All significant investments in affiliates that are exclusively controlled by Cerba European Lab, either directly or
indirectly, are fully consolidated.

French legislation requires that for laboratories that are incorporated as SELs, the clinical pathologists operating
such SELs hold a majority of the shares and voting rights of such entities. In strict compliance with these
regulatory constraints, the group has set up a capital structure that meets these obligations while the by-laws
governing such entities grant us a majority of the economic rights in such subsidiaries. Further, provisions of the
by-laws and shareholder agreements that we have entered into with the clinical pathologists holding majority
voting power give us negative control over key matters of corporate governance, including the incurrence of
indebtedness, acquisitions and dispositions.

Although the group does not hold the majority of voting rights in its SEL subsidiaries, the above-mentioned
mechanisms allow it to obtain the majority of the economic benefits and also to demonstrate the existence of
control, while being in full compliance with French legislation, therefore enabling the French entities to be fully
consolidated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

_Revenue_

Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual volume discounts for
hospitals.

Our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations are carried out in clinical laboratories. Revenue related to
the analyses/tests carried out is recognized when the test report is validated by the clinical pathologist (i.e., the
date on which results are given to the client).

For our Central Lab business, clinical trials are governed by contractual agreements providing for specific
invoicing at each stage. Revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Percentage of
completion is measured on the basis of work performed.

_Income tax_

Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss
unless they relate to a business combination, or to items that are recognized directly in equity or in other
comprehensive income.

Current tax is (i) the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable profit or tax loss for the period, using tax
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and (ii) any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

101


-----

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognized for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit;

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that it is
probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they are
reversed, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, we take into account the impact of uncertain tax positions
and any additional taxes and interest that may be due.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and
liabilities and they relate to taxes levied by the same authority, either on the same taxable entity or on different
tax entities that intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, and realize their tax assets and
settle their tax liabilities simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax credits, tax losses and deductible temporary differences to the
extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred
tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
taxable profit will be realized.

The French Finance Act of 2010 eliminated the business tax (taxe professionnelle) as of 2010 and replaced it
with two new taxes: the property business tax (cotisation foncière des entreprises, or the “CFE”) and the value
added business tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises, or the “CVAE”). In accordance with the
opinion of the Conseil National de la Comptabilité, the body that sets French national accounting standards,
dated January 14, 2010, the group has concluded that the CVAE falls within the scope of International
Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 12 and it has therefore been recognized under income tax. A deferred tax liability
related to the CVAE is recognized.

_Provisions_

A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the group has a present legal or constructive obligation
that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle
the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The
unwinding of the discount is recognized under finance costs.

_Restructuring. A provision for restructuring is recognized when the group has approved a detailed and formal_
restructuring plan, and the restructuring (i) either has commenced (ii) or has been announced publicly. Future
operating losses are not provisioned.

_Financial assets measured at amortized cost. We consider evidence of impairment for financial assets_
measured at amortized cost (loans and receivables) at both a specific asset and collective level.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices we issue require specific credit management processes.
Impairment policies for receivables have been implemented on the basis of historical trends. However,
impairment allowances are allocated specifically. In specialized clinical pathology laboratories, the collection of
receivables from direct patients, which are more than 35 days overdue, is handled by a debt collection company.

In assessing collective impairment, we use historical trends of the probability of default, the timing of collection
and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted based on management’s judgment as to whether current economic and
credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or less than those suggested by historical
trends.

102


-----

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference
between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Losses are recognized in
profit or loss under “Net change in depreciation and amortization” and are recorded in an allowance account for
loans and receivables. When an event occurring after the impairment was recognized causes the amount of
impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

_Goodwill_

_Initial recognition. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition_
date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the group.

We measure goodwill at the acquisition date as:

- the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus

- the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, plus

- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the
acquiree, less

- the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the group incurs in
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent
consideration is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in profit or loss.

Commercial goodwill that is acquired by the group is accounted for as a business combination.

_Subsequent measurement. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For the purposes_
of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units (“CGUs”) or group(s) of CGUs that are
expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combination.

The CGUs or group of CGUs identified by the group are as follows:

- the specialized clinical pathology CGU, corresponding to our Specialized Testing business;

- the France private clinical laboratory testing CGU and the Belux private clinical laboratory testing CGU,
corresponding to our Routine Lab business; and

- the clinical trial CGU, corresponding to our Central Lab business.

To determine the value in use of each CGU, cash flows are discounted based on the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), calculated on the basis of expected return and market risk for each CGU.

The final value is calculated using ad infinitum order to pay of the discounted cash flow, determined on the
basis of a normalized flow and an ad infinitum growth rate. This growth rate is in accordance with the markets
development potential as regards the business as well as its competitive position. The discounted cash flows are
compared to the sum of the goodwill value as well as to the operating assets allocated to the CGUs (intangible
assets, items of property, plant and equipment and components of working capital, net of deferred tax
liabilities).

Commercial goodwill acquired during the period is recognized as part of goodwill.

_Derivative financial instruments_

The group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. The derivative financial
instruments held are interest rate swaps. The derivative financial instruments are not designated as hedging

103


-----

instruments in a hedging relationship as set out in IAS 39. Consequently, changes in their fair value are directly
recognized in profit or loss.

_Employee benefits_

In accordance with the laws and practices of the countries in which it operates, the group grants its employees
post-employment benefits (pension plans) and other long-term benefits (long-service bonuses).

_Defined benefit plans. The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for_
each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have vested in return for their service in the
current and prior periods. This benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognized past
service costs and the fair value of plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on
AA credit- rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the group’s obligations and that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.

The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The group
recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income.

_Other long-term employee benefits. The group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other_
than pension plans is the amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for their service in the current
and prior periods. The benefits mainly comprise seniority bonuses.

_obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but some of this information may have been derived from_
_estimates or subjective judgments or have been subject to limited audit and validation. While we believe this_
_market data to be accurate and correct, we have not independently verified it._

**Overview**

We are engaged in three principal lines of business within the broader industry of clinical laboratory testing
services. We conduct clinical pathology testing through our Routine Lab business and our Specialized Testing
business. Our Routine Lab business provides local, low-complexity diagnostic testing services to patients. Our
Specialized Testing business activities include providing highly complex clinical pathology, pathology and
cytogenetic testing services outsourced from private and public laboratories. Additionally, our Central Lab
business is engaged in supporting pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the clinical trial phase of
their drug development. Each of our businesses focuses on different geographical regions, is targeted at a
different clientele and is consequently subject to different competitive environments and market trends.

**Clinical pathology testing**

Clinical pathology testing is broadly split between routine laboratory testing, which we conduct through our
Routine Lab business, and specialized laboratory testing, which we conduct through our Specialized Testing
business.

Routine laboratory testing provides diagnostic, low-complexity testing to patients who are prescribed a
particular test by their physician or on behalf of public and private hospitals that do not have in-house
laboratories. Such diagnostic tests include clinical laboratory testing, or testing based on the analysis of bodily
fluids, such as blood tests and urinalysis. Patients are either prescribed a test as part of a visit to their regular
doctor or are required to undergo a diagnostic test when admitted to a hospital, in connection with the diagnosis,
evaluation, detection, monitoring and treatment of medical conditions such as cancer, infectious diseases,
endocrine disorders, cardiac disorders and genetic diseases. Laboratories such as ours receive business either
directly from patients referred by their physician or patients who choose to have their tests performed by a
particular laboratory.

Specialized laboratory testing focuses on complex, relatively uncommon laboratory testing needs that local
smaller laboratories and hospitals are unable or unwilling to meet due to the expertise required. The types of
tests that fall under this category include:

- clinical pathology, such as molecular and cellular-level testing, virology, immunological analyses,
bacteriological testing, and other tests related to hormonology and oncology;

- anatomical pathology, which is the testing of histologic or cytological samples (such as human tissue); and

- cytogenetic testing, such as prenatal testing for hereditary disorders.

**_Market overview_**

We operate our Routine Lab business in various parts of France, Belgium and Luxembourg. Providers of routine
laboratory testing services in these three countries include public laboratories associated with large public
research facilities (such as regional hospitals and university hospitals in France), small local laboratories run by
clinical pathologists themselves and clinical laboratory networks like us.

Customers in the specialized laboratory testing market differ from those of the routine laboratory testing market.
Specialized laboratories mostly receive samples through outsourcing referrals from other private laboratories
and public hospitals that do not have the facilities, certifications, expertise or volume levels necessary to
perform the requested tests. Laboratories engaged in specialized testing typically centralize their testing
functions in one location, transporting samples to be tested to their main testing facility. All of our specialized
testing is performed at our centralized facility in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France. Due to the low volume and high
geographical dispersion of specialized samples origination, sophisticated logistics systems are required to

transport samples from collection points all over the world to testing centers. For the year ended December 31,
2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, 92.2% and 90.9% of our Specialized Testing net sales,
respectively, were derived from specialized tests performed on samples collected in France (either through our
routine laboratories or from tests outsourced to us by hospitals and other private laboratories) and in the same
periods, 7.8% and 9.1% of our Specialized Testing net sales were derived from specialized tests performed on
samples collected by clients we work with in over 50 countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.

The specialized laboratory testing market is also marked by notably high barriers to entry. Establishing a
specialty laboratory requires significant investments in specific equipment and the maintenance of a staff of
trained professionals with a high level of scientific expertise and technological know-how. In order to sustain
the profitability of its business, a specialty laboratory must also be able to manage logistics efficiently and
cost-effectively, in particular with respect to sample transportation which needs to have a broad geographical
scope to capture sufficient volumes for the business to be profitable. In addition, certain highly specialized tests
require additional certification from local regulatory authorities. Finally, much like the routine laboratory testing
business, the majority of prices for specialized laboratory testing are fixed by health regulatory authorities in the
local jurisdiction. As a result of these requirements, many laboratories engaged in routine testing are unable to
enter into the specialized testing business. Likewise, we believe that it would be challenging for foreign
competitors with specialized testing capabilities to establish the necessary and accredited logistics footprint,
comply with the regulatory requirements and obtain the required referrals to develop a sustainable competitive
position in our core French market.

_France_

In 2013, according to “Comptes nationaux de la santé 2013”, the private market for clinical laboratory testing in
France increased by 0.4% and represented revenue of approximately €4.3 billion, making it one of the largest
private markets in Europe. According to the “Rapport de la Cour des Comptes”, the value of the French private
clinical laboratory testing market is estimated to have experienced approximately 3.1% compound annual
growth from 2007 to 2012, reflecting the net effect of tariff decreases and a combined growth effect of volume
and mix. Based on government targeted annual savings in French clinical pathology expenditures of
approximately €100 million (resulting from the recommendations of the Ballereau report issued in 2008), we
believe, in accordance with data reported by “Les comptes de la sécurité sociale”, that tariffs in the lab test
market declined by 4.3% and 2.6% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. These tariff decreases were offset by 4.6%
compound annual growth resulting from a combined volume and mix impact.

In France, doctors prescribe clinical laboratory tests and patients are free to choose the clinical laboratory in
which they are tested. Patients typically choose a laboratory based on proximity to their home or workplace.
Accordingly, choice of a high traffic location and reputation for quality of services are key factors. The
laboratory completes the testing process in-house except for specialized tests which can be outsourced to
specialized laboratories.

Tariffs for laboratory tests are set by the Ministry of Health (Ministère des Affaires sociales et de la Santé) and
the National Health Insurance Fund (Caisse Nationale d’Assurance Maladie).

According to “Comptes nationaux de la santé 2013”, in 2013, approximately 72.1% of spending in the French
private clinical pathology testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder
was covered by private insurance companies (approximately 25.1%) and by the patient directly out of pocket
(approximately 2.8%). This split has not materially changed in recent years. The French social security system
updates its catalog of tests (BIOLAM), on an annual basis, and determines the amount of reimbursement, if any,
for each clinical test. Approximately 90% of our net sales for Routine Lab and Specialized Testing in France are
derived from tests for which prices are regulated and reimbursed by the social security system.

The clinical pathology testing market remains highly fragmented in France, with approximately 6.2 laboratories
per 100,000 people in 2013, as opposed to more consolidated markets such as Germany, where there were
approximately 0.7 laboratories per 100,000 people in 2011. This fragmentation is the historical result of legal
requirements that limited outsourcing, restricted laboratory ownership, capped the number of branches of a
single laboratory and set constraints on how much of a specific area’s testing needs any one laboratory could
cover. The five leading networks of laboratories in France (including Labco, Cerba, Unilabs, Bomnis and
Novescia) increased their market share from 16% to 26% between 2010 and 2014. Based on our net sales for
2011, we believe we had a market share of approximately 8.1% of the French private clinical pathology testing
market. Following the Novescia acquisition, we expect our market share to increase to approximately 13.4%.

_Belgium_

According to the Belgian national healthcare regulator, INAMI, the Belgian regulated clinical pathology
laboratory testing market grew at a compound annual rate of approximately 3.4% between 2008 and 2011 and
generated revenue of approximately €1.4 billion in 2013, of which 75% is reimbursed by the Belgian social
security system.

The laboratory services market in Belgium is split between tests performed for patients that are in the hospital,
which is referred to as hospitalized care, and tests performed for patients that are not hospitalized, which is
referred to as ambulatory care, our addressable market. Approximately 50% of all the tests performed for
ambulatory care are performed by private laboratories such as ours, the other 50% being performed by
intra-hospital laboratories. According to INAMI, the ambulatory care segment represented in 2010
approximately 60% of the total clinical pathology market. Ambulatory care is mainly structured on the basis of a
business-to-business model where samples are collected at a doctor’s practice before being delivered to clinical
laboratories such as ours for testing. However, certain laboratories, including ours, also maintain collection
centers for direct access to patients. Approximately 95% of our net sales for Routine Lab in Belgium are derived
from tests for which prices are regulated and that are reimbursed by the social security system.

Reimbursement levels for tests included in the INAMI catalog are set by the Belgium health authorities. In
certain cases, laboratories are allowed to bill a small supplemental administrative fee per patient in addition to
the set price for a test. Laboratory tests that are prescribed for non-therapeutic reasons may be excluded from
INAMI’s price regulation and are set freely by individual laboratories.

The Belgian clinical biology market has undergone considerable consolidation in the past 20 years. The
consolidation process has been primarily driven by the easing of ownership restrictions to allow for the
ownership of clinical laboratories by investors who are not clinical pathologists, the increasing difficulty in
obtaining authorizations to operate and tariff reductions. According to the specialized press, the number of
accredited laboratories has decreased by 12,5% between March 2010 and February 2014 (Le Medecin
_Spécialiste, n° spécial/Avril 2014, ISSN 0770-8181)._

_Luxembourg_

The Luxembourg market is split between public and private laboratories. Public laboratories (including
laboratories that are part of hospitals and clinics, as well as institutions such as the National Health Laboratory)
provide routine laboratory testing to hospitalized and ambulatory patients, whereas private laboratories serve
ambulatory patients exclusively.

Prices for all laboratory tests are set by the Luxembourg Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé) and the
national insurance scheme (Caisse Nationale de Santé). The state reimburses 100% of test expenses at the fee
level set in the annual catalog released by government health authorities.

In 2011, the total ambulatory clinical laboratory services market in Luxembourg generated revenue of
approximately €58.5 million, of which approximately €50.8 million was attributable to private laboratories.
According to internal estimates, we believe that the value of the private lab testing segment in Luxembourg
grew at a compound annual rate of approximately 4.9% from 2008 to 2011. As of 2011, there were three private
laboratories operating in Luxembourg.

**_Competition_**

_Routine Lab_

The routine laboratory testing market in the countries in which we operate has limited competitive dynamics
because of its fragmented nature and patients’ tendency to go to the nearest laboratory to their home or
workplace. As such, the competitive dynamics among the larger industry players revolve around the regional
density of their network. In the long term, however, we believe that the rising pressures on governments to
reduce healthcare spending as they face budget constraints are likely to lead to greater harmonization across the
European market and further liberalization of regulatory requirements, which in turn will lead to increased
competition. We believe that this could lead to cross-border consolidation among market participants and
increased penetration of the European market by some of the major non-European laboratory groups such as
Quest Diagnostics, Laboratory Corporation of America and Sonic Healthcare.

107


-----

Due to the regulated fee structure of the routine laboratory testing markets in which we operate, we mostly
compete on the basis of the quality of the services we provide and the density of our network. We believe that
patients who are free to choose the clinical laboratories where they are tested usually base their choice on a
laboratory’s proximity to their home or workplace. Medical doctors sometimes refer patients to specific
laboratories regardless of location. We believe that referring doctors and facilities that outsource their testing
consider the following factors, among others, in selecting a clinical laboratory:

- medical and scientific expertise;

- the accuracy, timeliness and consistency in reporting test results;

- the reputation of the clinical laboratory in the medical community or field of specialty;

- the service capability and convenience;

- the number and type of tests performed;

- the method and speed of delivering/publishing results; and

- the tools for interpreting results offered.

The competitive landscape for the routine laboratory testing market that we face varies from market to market.
In each of the countries in which we operate, however, we compete with local and regional independent
laboratories.

In France, in addition to local and regional market participants, we also face competition from nationwide
groups such as Labco, Novescia and Unilabs. We believe that we are one of the two largest providers in the
French Routine Lab market in terms of revenue, based on management estimates for 2013, achieved through our
local leadership within regional clusters. Through our recent acquisitions, we have grown our market share
allowing us to secure a leading position in the industry.

In Belgium, we face competition from hospitals that provide routine laboratory testing themselves, as well as
from nationwide private laboratories such as Labco, Sonic Healthcare, Amedes and Synlab. We believe that in
2011 we held a market share of approximately 5.1% of the Belgian ambulatory care testing market, based on our
revenue, making us the third largest private provider of routine testing in Belgium, due in part to our leading
presence in the Flanders region.

In Luxembourg, we compete with hospitals and with the other two private laboratories in Luxembourg,
Laboratoires Réunis and Laboratoire Forges du Sud. We believe that in 2011 we held a market share of
approximately 52.5% of the Luxembourg private ambulatory routine testing market, based on revenue, which
makes us the largest private ambulatory care routine laboratory in Luxembourg.

_Specialized testing_

Because the services provided by specialized testing laboratories affect the delivery of healthcare, a large
proportion of the tests performed by participants in this industry have rates set by central health authorities.
Market participants are thus limited in the prices that they can charge patients or healthcare providers for
services rendered and price competition is limited to only those tests that are outside the official testing catalog
of the various public health authorities. Such pricing constraints do not apply in countries where pricing is
liberalized, and international laboratories are able to set pricing competitively in such markets. However, most
firms are limited to competing based on the breadth of their testing offerings, the amount of time it takes for test
results to be made available to patients and the reliability of the logistics involved in sample transport.

Although we perform specialized tests for clients located in over 50 countries in Europe, North Africa and the
Middle East, France generated 92.2% of our Specialized Testing net sales for the year ended December 31,
2013. We believe that in 2011, we held a leading share of the public and private specialized testing business in
France, based on revenue. Today, we believe to be the co-leader in the French specialized testing market. Our
main competitor in France is Biomnis. We also face a marginal amount of competition in France from public
hospital laboratories. Outside France, we face competition from local participants and large international firms.

**_Market trends_**

_Routine Lab_

_Shift to preventive care, early detection and companion diagnostics_

Western European governments continue to face unprecedented financial strain and seek to rein in healthcare
spending in order to meet deficit reduction goals. Concluding that it is less expensive to prevent a disease than
to treat one after its onset, health ministries have pursued policies that strongly favor preventive care in addition
to a push for more accurate diagnostic testing to facilitate early detection of disease. Further, doctors are
increasingly prescribing clinical laboratory tests to help identify potential diseases for early detection and to
monitor patients throughout the course of an illness to evaluate treatment and make modifications as necessary.
This shift is leading to greater reliance on diagnostic testing services. Based on publicly available information,
we believe that the portion of overall healthcare expenditure worldwide allocated to prediction, diagnosis and
disease monitoring will have increased from approximately 40% in 2012 to 65% in 2025, at the expense of
expenditures allocated to treatment. As technologies develop over the long term, we believe there will be a trend
favoring companion diagnostics, or the use of genetic markers over the life of a patient to create specialized
treatments and develop individualized prevention plans. We believe that this trend will result in overall greater
demand for laboratory testing and, consequently, increased volumes.

_Volume trends_

We believe that demographic trends and changes in lifestyles will lead to increased demand, and consequently
increased volume, for medical testing. As life expectancy continues to grow in Europe, the number of persons
aged 60 and over will increase as well. The French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies
(INSEE) reported in 2011 that the population aged 60 and over increased by +22.8% between 2001 and 2011
and predicted that it would increase by 10.4 million between 2007 and 2060. As a result, one in three person will
be aged 60 and over in 2060. Further, similar aging trends can be seen in Luxembourg, where the proportion of
the population aged 60 and over has increased in recent years and is likely to continue to increase. Older
populations have greater demand for healthcare and testing. Further, recent years have seen the growth of
chronic diseases that result from certain lifestyle choices, such as low levels of physical activity, malnutrition
and stress, such as chronic illnesses related to obesity. We believe that these demographic and public health
trends will lead to increased demand for healthcare services and, as a result, increase the volume of medical
testing.

**Evolution of lab test volumes in France 2007 - 2012 (year-on-year growth %)**

[GRAPHIC]

We believe that volume growth will continue to be mitigated in part by government efforts to control healthcare
spending. As governments face pressure to reduce deficits due to the current economic climate, they have turned
to several measures to reduce expenditures, including putting pressure on testing volumes.

_Pricing trends_

The routine laboratory testing market has experienced tariff reductions as a result of pressure on state budgets to
reduce deficits, leading to greater attention being paid to the costs of healthcare delivery. In France, Belgium
and Luxembourg, laboratory tariff levels are regularly updated. For instance, France has faced particularly high
deficits in its national health insurance scheme, including recent shortfalls of approximately €8.6 billion in 2011
and €5.9 billion in 2012 and €6.8 billion in 2013. The CNAM revises the price catalog for laboratory tests on an
annual basis and we expect further downward pressure on tariffs in France going forward as the government
endeavors to further reduce the rate of growth of national healthcare expenditures, although we are unable to be
certain of the extent of any future reductions. In October 2013, an agreement was signed with the CNAM to
provide for an annual total market increase in clinical pathology of 0.25% for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016,
despite possible tariff reductions contemplated for the future.

According to INAMI, the Belgian social security system reimburses approximately 75% of regulated clinical
pathology test expenditures. The “closed envelope” system, which is currently in place, enables the government
to claw back excess or under-spending two years later in the pricing mechanism. In our case this has led to a
high degree of variability, positive and negative, in price movements from one year to another.

_Technological evolution and quality standards_

As new technologies develop and set new standards for testing quality, laboratories are likely to experience
pressure to upgrade and adopt new standards. For example, French regulatory reforms enacted in 2010 and 2013
now require that clinical laboratories conform to stricter ISO operating standards by 2020. Further
improvements in medical and information technologies and quality standards are also shaping the private
clinical laboratory services market on a broader level, as they facilitate timelier and more effective decisions
which ultimately improve patient care and reduce medical costs. The costs of compliance with new quality
standards and the continual need to invest in new testing equipment will favor larger participants with greater
resources available to make large expenditures. We believe that laboratories will use their voluntary adherence
to ever stricter standards of quality as a means of distinguishing themselves from their competitors.

_Market consolidation_

We believe that the routine laboratory testing market in Europe, particularly in France, will become less
fragmented through the combined influence of pricing pressures from payers, liberalized regulation and
enhanced quality and accreditation standards. Regulatory restrictions on outsourcing quotas and staffing quotas
for clinical laboratories have been lifted over recent years in order to rationalize delivery of healthcare services
and reduce the costs paid by social security systems. Further, fixed compliance costs have increased due to
stricter safety and quality control standards. These higher fixed costs, combined with budget cutting measures to
reduce or contain reimbursement rates, will likely encourage consolidation among market participants aiming to
achieve economies of scale and other related synergies. We believe that consolidated networks of laboratories
will be able to move toward a more industrialized model of clinical testing and transform the rest of the network
into collection centers where samples are collected and transferred to a technical platform for testing with the
ability to carry out a larger volume of tests by centralizing their testing operations at regional technical
platforms. As previously mentioned, the operation of networks of collection centers around a central technical
platform allows for cost efficiencies for reagent costs and equipment and administrative costs due to the
concentration of testing volume in one testing facility. Given that patients generally choose the clinical
laboratories where they are tested based on the proximity to their home or workplace, denser networks naturally
allow for increased patient coverage and subsequent volumes. Consolidation will allow laboratories to achieve a
critical size necessary to make up for diminishing marginal revenues from individual tests due to
government-imposed tariff reductions. Such consolidation could increase the market share of medium—and
large-scale laboratory groups with a preexisting footprint and level of expertise and could accelerate the
entrance of large competitors in the European market.

_Outsourcing_

The outsourcing by public and private hospital laboratories to the benefit of private organizations is another
trend observed in the European routine laboratory testing market over the last few years. In the long term, we
believe that outsourcing will provide greater revenue for groups such as ours. We believe that the French,
Belgian and Luxembourg markets may provide us with further outsourcing opportunities in the near future.

_Specialized testing_

Many of the same trends that affect the market for routine laboratory testing described above also play a key
role in the market for specialized laboratory testing.

_Shift to preventive care, early detection and companion diagnostics_

110


-----

Based on publicly available information, we believe that the share of overall healthcare spending worldwide
dedicated to prediction, diagnosis and disease monitoring will have increased from approximately 40% in 2012
to 65% by 2025, spurred on by governments’ emphasis on disease prevention as a means of reducing the costs
associated with disease treatment. We believe that specialized laboratory testing stands to benefit substantially
from this policy shift. For example, specialized tests such as cytogenetic testing for specific disease markers can
be a very powerful tool for predicting, and ultimately preventing, many illnesses. As technologies develop over
the long term, we believe there will be a trend favoring companion diagnostics, or the use of genetic markers
over the life of a patient to create specialized treatments and develop individualized prevention plans. The trend
can already be observed through the increasing demand for companion diagnostics using genetic testing. As
specialized tests continue to develop as means for accurately predicting disease onset and drug interactions, we
believe that physicians will be inclined to rely on them further in their clinical practice.

_Pricing trends_

Because specialized laboratory testing is a part of the healthcare system, prices are regulated by state medical
insurance authorities and third-party payers in a similar manner to prices for routine laboratory testing. As a
result, our specialized laboratory testing business is also susceptible to increased pressures to limit the increase
of healthcare expenditure by governments through limiting the tariffs that can be legally charged for testing. We
believe that efforts to limit the rate of growth in healthcare expenditure will result in further reductions in
regulatory tariffs in the future. However, we expect price pressures will be lower than in our Routine Lab
business given the relatively low prices that are already in place in France for specialized tests. Despite pricing
pressures, reimbursement rates from public authorities and the number of tests that are covered by social
security systems have remained relatively stable. Although our Specialized Testing business outside France is
not technically regulated in terms of price, we need to price our offerings competitively with respect to local
laboratories that may be subject to price regulations and on behalf of whom we perform specialized tests.

_Volume trends_

We believe the demand for specialized testing will increase as Europeans age and their healthcare needs
increase. We also believe that the continuing trend toward preventive and predictive care will increase demand
for laboratory testing, including the tests we perform in our Specialized Testing business. Public hospitals facing
increased demand for specialized tests should be volume drivers as we believe there will be an increase in
outsourcing to private laboratories such as ours. However, we believe that such an increase in outsourcing will
be balanced by an increase in the internalization of specialized testing functions by regional groups of
laboratories that, due to regulatory liberalization, are able to consolidate and combine forces to achieve the
necessary scale to perform certain specialized tests on a cost-efficient basis, subject to achieving the required
scope and logistics capabilities to make this economical. Testing volumes for specialized laboratories may be
negatively impacted from time to time by technological progress as customers may find it more cost-efficient to
insource certain specialized tests if affordable equipment becomes available in the market. For example, the
development of a new vitamin D test that enabled smaller lab companies to perform the test internally impacted
volumes of several large specialized laboratory companies including us.

_Market consolidation_

The consolidation of the private laboratories market in France may result in some volume shifts across the two
main players as the acquiring networks tend to concentrate for efficiency purposes their outsourced volumes
with one specialized laboratory.

_Scientific advancements and quality standards_

Because price competition is limited due to regulatory constraints, specialized laboratory testing market
participants typically compete and seek to differentiate themselves on the perceived quality of their test
offerings, their capacity for innovation and the scientific know-how of their staff. Specialized laboratory testing
is also subject to the heightened regulatory accreditation standards that are currently in place in France and that
are being implemented elsewhere in Europe.

_Globalization_

We derived 7.8% of the net sales of our Specialized Testing business for the year ended December 31, 2013
from markets outside of France, including other countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. With
increased improvements in logistics services and the capacity to transport samples reliably and quickly over

111


-----

long distances, we believe that the market for specialized laboratory testing will continue to develop on a global
scale, with large actors competing for market share around the world.

**Central Lab**

We provide central laboratory testing services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and contract
research organizations (CROs) in connection with the clinical trial phase of their drug development processes.
In 2011, the central laboratory testing market was estimated to be worth over $1.9 billion worldwide by
MarketResearch.com. The central laboratory business is largely tied to the activity of biopharmaceutical
companies.

New drugs generally go through four phases of clinical testing before being marketed to the general public for
use. Drug safety authorities receive reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing, and they may
require the modification, suspension or termination of clinical trials if they conclude that an unwarranted risk is
presented to patients or healthy volunteers.

_Phase I. In Phase I, a drug is initially introduced into a small number of human individuals and tested for_
safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. Phase I clinical trials are often
conducted in healthy human male volunteers, and such cases do not provide evidence of efficacy. In the case of
severe or life-threatening diseases, or severely toxic drug candidates, the initial human testing is often conducted
in patients rather than healthy volunteers. Because these patients already have the target disease, these studies
may provide initial evidence of efficacy that would traditionally be obtained in Phase II clinical trials.
Consequently, these types of trials are frequently referred to as Phase I/II clinical trials.

_Phase II. Phase II involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to further identify any possible adverse_
effects and safety risks and to determine the optimal dosage for dose tolerance and efficacy of the product for
the specific target disease.

_Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and to further test_
for safety in an expanded patient population, at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. Phase III clinical
trials usually include a broader patient population so that safety and efficacy can be substantially established
across a wide range of genetic variation. Phase III clinical trials cannot begin until Phase II evaluation
demonstrates that a dosage range of the product may be effective (which is often referred to as demonstrating
“proof of concept”) and has an acceptable safety profile. In the event that Phase III testing yields desired results,
pharmaceutical companies will apply to have the compound approved by the relevant drug safety regulator.

_Phase IV. Phase IV clinical trials are performed if a drug safety regulator requires, or a pharmaceutical_
company pursues, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These clinical trials may be made a
condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. The results of Phase IV clinical trials can confirm the
effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important supplementary safety information.

Contract research organizations (“CROs”) provide all-inclusive outsourced clinical services for pharmaceutical
and biotechnology sponsors, including IT support, patient selection and logistical services. They provide their
services throughout the clinical testing cycle, from preclinical testing to Phase IV studies and new drug
applications. Reference laboratories work with both drug manufacturers and CROs by performing clinical
pathology testing to provide data on a test product’s usefulness and clinical safety.

Pricing in the central laboratory testing business is not tariff-regulated, but is set contractually with the third
parties for whom services are provided. This greater flexibility allows for more intense, price-based competition
among market participants. Additionally, the market is not limited to a particular geographic location; nearly all
the laboratories engaged in central laboratory testing operate on a multinational level.

Contracts for Central Lab customers vary in duration from six to 60 months, depending on the length of the
particular clinical trial for which our services are needed. Pricing is determined on a per test basis and is
generally fixed, although customers are sometimes offered rebates based on the achievement of specified
volumes of testing. Contracts estimate the volume of tests that will be required, although this is non-binding and
does not represent a commitment to order a specific volume of tests. We are subject to liability if we fail to
perform tests in a timely manner. Contracts may be terminated at any time at will by Central Lab customers,
without indemnification. In the event that a customer cancels or terminates a contract, we typically would be
entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent
customer-authorized services related to terminating the canceled project.

**_Competition_**

The central laboratory testing industry has a wide range of participants, from small providers of limited, highly
specialized services to full-service global organizations. Our central laboratory testing business competes with
the in-house research departments of pharmaceutical companies, limited and full-service CROs and public
institutions such as universities and hospitals.

We believe that we are a significant player in the Central Lab market worldwide, based on management
estimates for 2013. We compete mainly with U.S.-based large players such as Covance, Laboratory Corporation
of America, Quest Diagnostics and Quintiles.

Factors that affect a laboratory’s competitive outlook include:

- the prices for its services;

- the scope of its testing offerings;

- its scientific and medical expertise;

- its ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in a rapid and accurate manner;

- its historic experience and customer relationships; and

- the quality of its laboratory facilities.

**_Market trends_**

_Pricing trends_

Pricing in the centralized laboratory testing market is set competitively based on negotiations with
pharmaceutical companies and CROs. In addition, as market forces act to encourage consolidation among
laboratories, we believe that laboratories could drive prices down further and intensify price-based competition.
However, because the cost of analytical testing performed by centralized laboratory testing companies accounts
for a relatively small portion of the total cost of conducting clinical trials, we believe that downward pricing
pressure from pharmaceutical companies and CROs will be mitigated.

_Market consolidation_

We believe that the proportion of smaller central laboratories is likely to decrease following European
regulatory reforms requiring more stringent, and therefore costlier, certification requirements for the registration
of new drugs. Further, price-based competition favors larger participants able to provide economies of scale.
Finally, larger laboratories have greater resources with which to satisfy regulatory operating standards and to
attract scientific talent. As a result, we believe that further consolidation will take place in the market, leading to
higher concentration of market share among larger participants.

_Reinforced need for new products to replace aging blockbusters_

The past several decades in the pharmaceutical industry have been marked by “blockbuster” drugs that provided
unprecedented levels of revenue to drug companies. As time passes, patents providing exclusivity on such
successful drugs expire, and the associated revenue streams decrease, particularly as a result of generic
manufacturers. Drug companies seek to find new replacement drugs to help maintain profits. We believe this
will result in additional support for R&D efforts, which will in turn lead to more business for CROs and
reference laboratories such as us, since they play a key role in new drug development. Further, we believe new
drug applications will continue to be increasingly sophisticated, leading to greater demand for specialized
central laboratories with the expertise to support the patenting and regulatory approval of new products for
clinical use.

_Externalization of R&D_

Due to pressures on their margins from the loss of patent protection for former blockbuster drugs, pressure on
prices from insurance companies and the general economic downturn, pharmaceutical companies are seeking to
innovate while focusing on their core competencies. We believe that their desire to reduce costs will lead to an

113


-----

increase in the outsourcing of their clinical trial functions. Because CROs and reference laboratories are
specialized in the support of new drug development, from logistics through clinical testing and the registration
process, they are better positioned to identify and exploit market efficiencies, and operate more cheaply as a
result. Consequently, we believe pharmaceutical companies will find it increasingly cost efficient in the future to
outsource their clinical trial functions entirely to CROs and reference laboratories rather than duplicate efforts
inefficiently in-house. Further, while cost pressures have forced large pharmaceutical companies to reframe their
operations around their core competencies, smaller and mid-sized companies have been able to develop without
large companies’ higher operating costs and outsource a great deal of their R&D functions. These companies
have become an increasingly important driver of pharmaceutical industry growth. We believe that these smaller
companies will continue to provide an important source of Central Lab business in the years ahead.

**Business**

**Overview**

We are a leading European clinical pathology laboratory, providing routine and specialized clinical laboratory
testing services primarily in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, and supporting pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies worldwide in the clinical trial phase of their drug development processes.

Through our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations, we offer a range of over 2,500 routine and
specialty clinical tests used by doctors and medical institutions to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases. We
generally perform clinical tests using automated testing equipment, quickly delivering results to doctors,
hospitals and patients and offering specialized assistance with respect to interpretation of results. Through a
large network of high quality laboratories in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, our Routine Lab operations
perform a wide variety of clinical tests (including blood chemistry analyses, urinalyses, blood cell counts and
microbiology cultures and procedures) for patients who have generally been prescribed these tests by their
doctors. Our Specialized Testing operations offer private laboratories and public hospitals a broad range of
specialty testing services, such as molecular biology testing, oncology testing, allergy testing, hormonology
testing, infectious disease testing and diagnostic genetic testing. While French private laboratories and public
hospitals represent the largest share of our Specialized Testing customer base (90.9% of our Specialized Testing
net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2014), we also offer our services to hospitals or laboratories
based elsewhere in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The prices of a large majority of the clinical tests
that we offer in our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses are set by the respective government
authorities of the countries in which we operate.

Our Central Lab testing operations, which we operate through our BARC subsidiaries, provide safety and
efficacy testing services to pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations worldwide in
connection with drug development processes. We leverage our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing facilities
and expertise to develop testing protocols with our clients and to provide a range of safety, efficacy,
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic testing.

As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately 2,617 full-time equivalent employees and we employed
approximately 221 clinical pathologists. Over the course of our history, we have developed our business through
strategic acquisitions of regional laboratories, such as our acquisitions of JS Bio, Biotop, Biolille and
Bioréunion, as well as through selective purchases of larger testing platforms for access to new markets, such as
our acquisitions of LLAM in Luxembourg in 2011 and BARC in Belgium in 2007.

On December 19, 2014, we signed the Securities Purchase Agreement under which we will acquire directly
and/or indirectly all of the Target Group securities subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent. See
“The Acquisition.”

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated pro forma net sales of €575.2 million (our
Specialized Testing business accounted for €138.3 million, our Routine Lab business accounted for
€405.9 million, our Central Lab business accounted for €46.7 million and intercompany sales accounted for
negative €15.7 million) and Adjusted pro forma EBITDA (including Novescia synergies) of €136.8 million. See
“Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information, Pro Forma and Other Data—Other Financial, Pro
_Forma and Operating Data.”_

**Our history**

We were founded in 1967 in France as Laboratoires Cerba, a laboratory focused on specialized testing for local
medical laboratories and hospitals. We continued to develop our expertise in high quality specialized laboratory
testing over the years, aided by our acquisition of the specialized medical biology department of the Pasteur
Institute in Paris in 1998. This acquisition made us the leading specialized testing laboratory in Europe. Since
then, we have pursued a strategy of diversifying our business both in terms of services provided and
geographical coverage. With our acquisition of BARC in 2007, we expanded into the central laboratory testing
business as well as the routine laboratory testing business in Belgium. We have continued to expand our Routine
Lab business through a series of strategic acquisitions since then, including French laboratories such as Biolille
in the Lille metropolitan area in 2009, CBCV in the Paris area and Biotop in the Marseille area in 2010,
BioPyrénées Lab (formerly Bioadour) in southwestern France, Bioréunion in La Réunion, SELAS de la Baie in
Brittany in 2011 and JS Bio in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region as well as laboratories in Luxembourg,
such as Ketterthill Laboratories (which we acquired through our acquisition of LLAM in 2011), and Belgium,

115

such as Medic Lab, which we acquired in 2011. From a single laboratory site in 2007, we have grown to operate
approximately 248 laboratory sites with a staff of approximately 221 clinical pathologists as of September 30,
2014.

A number of transactions have been conducted in the past with respect to the control and ownership of our
group, most notably in 2010 with the purchase by PAI of a majority stake in our holding company. The
remainder of our shares are held by laboratory doctors and members of management. Prior to the PAI
acquisition, IK Investment Partners and Astorg Partners were our majority owners.

**Our competitive strengths**

Our business benefits from a number of competitive strengths, including:

**_Integrated, efficient and diversified business model_**

We operate an integrated, efficient and diversified business model based on strong and recognized medical
expertise, as well as proven industrial and organizational know-how. Our reputation for scientific excellence,
inherited from our historical specialty business founded in 1967 in France as well as our Central Lab business
founded in 1985 in Belgium benefits the entire organization through cross-selling, cost synergies, training,
technical support and sharing of best practices, as well as quicker and easier access to technology and to
top-trained clinical pathologists. We believe our reputation for scientific excellence is particularly valuable to
our Specialized Testing and Central Lab businesses and is a significant strength as we look to continue taking
part in the consolidation of the routine lab market. Our reputation boosts our credibility as a market
consolidator. Through its link with the medical and pharmaceutical communities, our Central Lab business
provides us with insights into new clinical pathology tests being developed in the industry. The strong medical
expertise of our group and its exposure to rare pathologies also help attract and retain the best clinical
pathologists. We believe our Central Lab business leverages our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing
infrastructure, equipment and clinical pathologists to perform safe and cost-effective testing of new drugs,
thereby generating significant cost synergies.

Our business model also benefits from our strong experience in managing large-scale technical and logistical
networks, which allows us not only to expand organically and geographically our different businesses, but also
to optimize internal synergies between them. In particular, our strong logistics expertise, based on outsourced
operations managed by in-house experts, allows us to optimize our size and organization in a cost—and
operationally effective way.

Our presence across all segments of the industry also allows us to benefit from the entire life cycle of a test,
from its early and confidential use, as part of a drug trial in Central Lab, to its more common use in Specialized
Testing through to its massive dissemination as a routine test. Finally, our integrated business model has
allowed us to better absorb pricing pressures and improve profitability by negotiating more advantageous
purchasing conditions with our reagent and equipment suppliers. We regularly invest in the latest technological
advances in our field and are able to attract and retain leading clinical pathologists.

**_Leading market positions across routine, specialty and central lab testing_**

We are the only clinical pathology laboratory in Europe with leading market positions in all its geographies and
across all three segments of the clinical laboratory services industry based on revenue. Following the
Acquisition, we believe that we will be the largest private network of clinical pathology laboratories in France
and one of the top four private players in Europe by net sales, based on management estimates. We also believe
that, based on management estimates for 2014, we were among the three largest private providers of routine
testing in Belgium and among the three largest private ambulatory care routine laboratories in Luxembourg. In
Specialized Testing, our historical core business, we believe that we were co-leader of the market in France
based on management estimates for 2014, with customers in more than 50 countries across Europe, the Middle
East and North Africa. Finally, we believe we are a significant player in the Central Lab market worldwide,
based on management estimates for 2014. Our position as market leader in the three segments in which we
operate enables us to attract the best clinical pathologists and to be at the forefront of both technological and
medical advancements in the clinical pathology industry as a result of our privileged relationships with the
medical and scientific communities. Our position as a leader has made us a key player in the consolidation of
the routine market.

116


-----

We believe we offer one of the largest catalogs of clinical tests in Europe, with over 2,500 tests as of
December 31, 2014, of which approximately 1,500 are highly specialized in molecular clinical pathology,
immunology, cellular clinical pathology, bacteriology, hormonology, oncology and rare biochemistry. As of
September 30, 2014, we employed approximately 221 clinical pathologists who perform and interpret clinical
tests processed on our technical platforms and assist external clinical pathologists and doctors in their
diagnostics.

**_Resilient and growing market underpinned by strong fundamentals and further growth opportunities_**

The European clinical laboratory services market has been characterized by resilient growth over the past
several years, including through economic downturns, benefiting from favorable demographic and scientific
trends. The private clinical laboratory testing markets in France and Luxembourg experienced compound annual
growth from 2008 to 2011 of approximately 1.8% and 4.9%, respectively, while the total clinical laboratory
testing market in Belgium experienced compound annual growth of approximately 3.4% for the same period.

Past growth of the routine and specialty testing markets has been supported by strong demographic trends in our
geographical markets. Contrary to certain other European countries, the population in France, our main market,
continues to grow. In the meantime, as life expectancy continues to increase in Europe generally, the number of
people aged 60 and over (an age at which people request and need more medical treatments) increases too. In
addition, as birth rates remain relatively high in our markets, particularly in France, pregnant women also
generate a significant volume of medical testing.

Public health and scientific trends have also been key drivers of the growth of the routine and specialty testing
markets. As it is less expensive to prevent a disease than to treat it, governments have pursued policies that favor
preventive care, in addition to encouraging more accurate and sophisticated tests to facilitate early detection. We
believe, based on publicly available information, that from 2012 to 2025, the percentage of overall healthcare
expenditure worldwide dedicated to diagnosis, prediction and disease monitoring will increase from
approximately 40% to 65%. Finally, chronic diseases, which generally require regular testing for monitoring
purposes, have increased in recent years likely due to certain lifestyle trends, such as low levels of physical
activity, malnutrition, stress and pollution.

We believe that in addition to these demographic and public health fundamentals, other trends will lead to an
increase in the volume of medical testing, and thus support the future growth of our different markets. In
particular:

- we believe that new tests will emerge as technologies develop and personalization of prevention and
treatment will become the norm; we believe that the market will shift progressively to preventive care, early
detection and companion diagnostics;

- we also believe that the routine laboratory testing market in Europe will further consolidate, in particular in
France, which is still highly fragmented, with approximately 6.2 laboratories per 100,000 people in 2013, as
opposed to more consolidated markets such as Germany, where there were approximately 0.7 laboratories
per 100,000 people in 2011;

- state budget reductions, as well as regulatory liberalization, will further increase outsourcing of routine and
specialized tests from the public sector; in 2013, revenue from French clinical pathology laboratory testing
totaled approximately €4.3 billion, with private laboratories representing approximately 60% of the overall
French clinical laboratory testing market; and

- with respect to the central lab market, we believe that the necessity of the pharmaceutical industry to market
new drugs to replace aging blockbusters, as well as the further externalization of pharmaceutical
companies’ R&D capabilities, will increase demand for central lab testing.

**_Significant barriers to entry_**

The European testing markets in which we operate are characterized by regulatory and structural specificities
which make them more difficult and costly to penetrate for potential new entrants. We believe that scientific
reputation, technical capabilities, market and regulatory knowledge, as well as critical size, all of which are
characteristics of the Cerba group, are key elements that will be necessary to fully benefit from future growth
opportunities.

117


-----

We believe our group is well known for scientific excellence and cutting- edge technical know-how. Inherited
from our historical core specialty lab business founded in 1967 in France and our central lab business founded in
1985 in Belgium, this reputation, which has allowed us to establish a renowned brand name in the medical
laboratory testing industry, constitutes an invaluable strength vis-à-vis potential new entrants, in particular in
central lab where referral processes are long and difficult.

We operate in a highly regulated market with stringent regulations and strict accreditation procedures governing
the granting or the renewal of a license to operate a laboratory. Securing these mandatory accreditations entails
significant investment and lengthy and complex processes making it increasingly difficult for new entrants to
penetrate the market. For example, the existing administrative authorization process for the establishment and
operation of clinical laboratories in France will be replaced in November 2020 by a new accreditation procedure
that will introduce new, stricter requirements pursuant to the ISO standard (the new accreditation system will be
gradually implemented with two steps in November 2016, when 50% of the tests performed by a laboratory will
have to be accredited, and November 2018, when 70% of the tests performed by a laboratory will have to be
accredited). Non-accredited clinical laboratories were required to demonstrate that they had effectively begun
the new accreditation process by November 2013. This new accreditation process is costly and time-consuming.
As such, it will constitute a significant barrier to entry for new entrants and a significant burden for existing
small labs. Further, the legal constraints in the French market regarding mandatory shareholding of clinical
pathologists with which we believe we already comply, constitute a significant barrier to entry into the French
routine market. The stringent price regulations applicable to the routine and specialty markets in which we
operate also constitute serious obstacles for new entrants as these price constraints favor well-established and
large players who benefit from their existing reputation and large scale to implement a cost effective model.
Finally, we believe that in France, new networks would be difficult to create as the opening of new laboratories
or collection points requires several regulatory approvals, which are only rarely obtained as the market already
includes too many laboratories.

We also believe that size and scale, which would be highly difficult and costly to achieve in the short term for
any new entrant, are key strengths for larger market participants like us. We believe that larger participants, with
well-established and integrated logistical capabilities, are better equipped and positioned to treat high volume
testing in a more cost effective way, to consolidate the routine market where necessary, to secure loyalty from
outsourcing (for specialty lab) and commercial (for central lab) partners, to optimize synergies within the
different testing businesses and, finally, to seize growth opportunities in new geographical markets.

Finally, we believe that the logistics organization of our Specialized Testing business is a valuable asset that
would be difficult for new entrants to replicate. For cost and operational efficiency, we have outsourced the
operation of our logistics network to a trusted partner. Our partner, who is ISO accredited, is in charge of the
collection and transportation of samples. While we have outsourced this aspect of the logistics for our
Specialized Testing Business, we maintain in-house the management and proprietary mapping of the network.
This model, as well as our strong in-house logistics expertise and experience, allow us to collect an average of
approximately 13,000 samples per day, from more than 3,000 locations worldwide, and to ensure that all tubes
arrive before 7 a.m. in our specialty laboratory in Saint-Ouen- l’Aumône, near Paris, France, to be tested within
24 hours.

**_Proven consolidation strategy with a structured approach to acquisitions_**

Founded as a specialty laboratory in 1967, we have since then expanded into new businesses and new
geographies through acquisitions. With our acquisition of BARC in 2007, we expanded into the central
laboratory testing business as well as the routine laboratory testing business in Belgium. We have continued to
expand our Routine Lab business through a handful of strategic acquisitions in highly populated geographic
areas of France (such as Biolille in the Lille metropolitan area in 2009, CBCV in the Paris area in 2010, Biotop
in the Marseille area in 2010 and JS Bio in the Provence–Alpes–Côte d’Azur area in 2014), and Luxembourg
(such as Ketterthill Laboratories, which we acquired through our acquisition of LLAM in 2011), complemented
by a series of bolt-on acquisitions. While such strategic acquisitions are more complex and less frequent, they
enable us to expand into new geographic zones or into new segments. The laboratories we acquire through these
strategic acquisitions often serve as technical platforms regional clusters and perform the entire clinical
laboratory testing for the region. We complement these strategic acquisitions with a number of small bolt-on
acquisitions of laboratories that we transform into collection points where samples are collected from patients
and sent to the technical platforms for testing. Through this regional clusterization strategy built around
technical platforms, we have built a very dense network of laboratories centered around eight regional clusters
in France, three in Belgium and one in Luxembourg. From a single laboratory site in 2007, we have grown to
operate approximately 248 sites with a staff of approximately 221 clinical pathologists as of September 30,

118


-----

2014. In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014,
we completed 21, 8, 6 and 1 acquisition(s), respectively, of which respectively 18, 7, 4 and 0 were bolt-on
acquisitions.

Significant portions of the European clinical laboratory services market, especially the French market, remain
highly fragmented. These markets present opportunities for consolidation and growth.

In addition, certain regulatory changes, such as the introduction of mandatory accreditation and higher-quality
standards in France, generally benefit larger laboratory companies or networks like ours. Since 2007, we have
been an active consolidator in the routine lab market, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on
additional opportunities in France as well as in potential new markets. We have a dedicated team of four people
focused on finding, evaluating and executing external growth opportunities and have developed a structured
approach to acquisitions that capitalizes on the expertise and market knowledge of our senior management and
local laboratory doctors. The laboratory companies we acquire are often clients or competitors of ours with
whom we have had prior business interaction. This in-depth knowledge of the industry helps us pre-select
suitable acquisition targets. We have a disciplined approach to acquisitions, including the setting of internal
acquisition multiple targets and high due diligence standards, which include the participation of the senior
executives at the various stages of the acquisition process. While we typically focus on the bolt-on acquisitions
of small and medium sized laboratory companies with revenues in the range of approximately €1 million to
€10 million with the aim of consolidating our regional network around existing technical platforms, we have
also selectively acquired large regional clusters of laboratories in the past, such as BARC, LLAM and JS Bio to
establish our footprint in new geographical markets or to enter into new industries. We believe that the
fragmentation of the French clinical laboratory market, together with the general economic slowdown, allows us
to complete acquisitions of clinical laboratories at attractive prices.

Post-acquisition, we generally implement cost reduction initiatives aimed at increasing the profitability of the
clinical laboratories we acquire through economies of scale and the sharing of best practices with the rest of the
network. Certain synergies from bolt-on acquisitions can be realized upon closing of the acquisition such as
savings on reagent costs. We also achieve reductions in technical and administrative expenses as we shift
technical and administrative functions to our technical platforms. We also achieve savings by redeploying the
personnel of the acquired entity across our network in the technical platform, which can be a lengthier process
taking more than 24 months after acquisition in certain cases. However, due to voluntary departures resulting
from the redeployment process of our workforce to our regional platforms, some cost reductions relating to
personnel can be quickly realized.

**_Track record of a strong and sustained financial performance, with high margin and strong cash flow_**
**_generation_**

We have demonstrated sustained net sales compound annual growth of 17.4% between the year ended
December 31, 2009 reported at the Original Company level and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 at
the Company level, adjusted for the pro forma effect of acquisitions realized during the course of the twelve
months ended September 30, 2014. This sales growth has been underpinned by our acquisition strategy as we
have sought to increase our market share in the Routine Lab testing market.

The Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2011 and for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2014 increased from 21.5% to 22.9%, demonstrating our ability to rapidly
integrate acquired companies, realize synergies and gain greater operating leverage through our increased scale.
With the strong support of our main shareholders, we have developed and are implementing numerous cost
initiatives that allow us to further control our costs by optimizing our relationships with our suppliers, our
logistics operations and our information technology systems. This disciplined investment and cost control
strategy has allowed us to achieve a significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA margins over the years.

Finally, our business requires relatively low capital expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and working capital
requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended September 30,
2014, our net capital expenditures (excluding asset acquisitions), were €8.7 million, €9.9 million, €8.9 million
and €5.2 million, respectively. As a percentage of our net sales, capital expenditure (excluding asset
acquisitions) amounted to 3.1%, 3.0%, 2.5% and 1.7% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013
and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. Due to this favorable business model, we were
able to generate strong cash flow as reflected by our cash conversion rate of 85% for 2011, 86% for 2012, 89%
for 2013 and 93% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (cash conversion rate, expressed as a

119


-----

percentage, is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditure (excluding asset acquisitions), divided by
Adjusted EBITDA).

**_Well regarded and experienced management team at group level and unique governance and ownership_**
**_structure at operational level_**

We benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our current senior management team. In particular,
Catherine Rondot-Courboillet, our CEO and a highly regarded industry specialist in Europe, Jérôme Thill, our
CFO, Sylvie Cado, head of our Specialized Testing business, Alain Niederhoffer, our director of logistics and
purchasing, Philippe Buhl, head of our Routine Labs in France and Cyril Dubreuil, our sales director in France,
each of whom has more than nine years of experience in the industry with an average of 22 years’ industry
experience and an average of 16 years’ experience in the group.

Moreover, our ownership model is based on a strong entrepreneurial culture, where more than 100 laboratory
doctors and managers are shareholders of our structure, at our holding company level and at the different
operating laboratories levels. Our ownership model and structure gives us overall strategic control, while also
incentivizing doctors and managers to fully contribute to a common commercial, scientific and industrial project
and greatly rewarding commitment, development and innovation. We believe that our ownership structure is key
to the strength and success of our model as a whole.

Finally, the support and investment experience of our controlling shareholder, PAI, supplements the leadership
and knowledge of our senior management and laboratory doctors.

**Our strategy**

Based in particular on our strong scientific reputation and expertise, our strategy mainly consists of becoming a
leading network in the French routine lab market through consolidation, while maintaining our unique
positioning in the European specialty and central lab businesses. The key elements of our strategy are:

**_Drive organic volume growth across our business segments_**

The core of our group’s strategy consists of developing organically each of our different business segments
through coordinated but tailored action plans.

In the Specialty Testing market, we are committed first to maintaining our leadership through the renewal of our
catalog of tests, the acceleration of compliance with new ISO regulations and the improvement of our logistics
services, in particular at the international level. We intend to particularly focus our efforts on profitable organic
growth driven mainly by new tests and, to a lesser degree, by the expansion of our international activity. As a
result, we aim to innovate through new technologies, new tests and enhanced services for customers through
partnerships with hospitals and biotech companies, and through the work of our scientific and medical
committee. We also aim to further expand our export activity, leveraging our reputation and logistics
capabilities to reach more customers, including in selective new geographical markets. Our focus on profitable
organic growth will also imply the further development of synergies between our Specialized Testing business
and our Central Lab activities, in particular through biomarkers innovations. Finally, we intend to foster the
general profitability of our Specialized Testing business, including through the further automation of our
processes (such as invoicing and samples encoding) and the better optimization of new regulations.

With respect to our Routine Lab business, our strategy will encompass operational and functional alignment
between our regional clusters, which is facilitated by the deployment of a dedicated team. These alignment
efforts will further include the standardization of our routine industrial processes with respect to technical
platform operations, quality assurance and information systems. The dedicated team in charge of this integration
strategy will also focus on improving the management of our routine staff and the organization of our networks.
Finally, our strategy with respect to the organic growth of our Routine Lab business includes the selection of
those of our youngest laboratory doctors with the most promising managerial capabilities; we will provide them
with high quality business school training, with the aim of further improving the management of our laboratories
at the local level.

Finally, we intend to develop our Central Lab business through the further differentiation of the positioning of
BARC. In particular, we believe we will be able to achieve strong organic growth of our Central Lab business
by broadening our product selection from safety to tailor-made biomarkers and leveraging our strong scientific
knowledge and capabilities as well as our proven specialist approach implemented by a unique team of clinical

120


-----

pathologists, including through the co-development of new tests with clients. We also intend to develop our
Central Lab business by strengthening our leadership position in Europe and Africa, working to establish a
position in Asia, improving client services and adaptability including through price transparency and
competitiveness, strengthening our pure testing player approach (that is, our ability to intervene in all clinical
trial phases) and continuing our certification program and our tailor-made reporting approach. Finally, we intend
to strengthen our worldwide lab networks to capture new contracts and expand our customer base.

**_Selectively pursue acquisitions_**

In the French routine lab market, we are organized in eight regional clusters, which we intend to further expand.
In regions where we are already present, our expansion strategy will include selected small- and mid-size
bolt-on acquisitions that fit into and complement the existing local networks organized around technical
platforms. To expand into new regions, we intend either to pursue acquisitions of existing regional clusters
followed by further bolt-on acquisitions in line with our clusterization strategy, or to implement more significant
strategic transactions with larger players. Our strategic focus will be to pursue bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen
and increase the density of our regional network and local market share. As in the past, we expect bolt-on
acquisitions to generate immediate synergies by transforming the acquired small laboratories into collection
points that feed samples to a technical platform where test analysis is centralized. The strategic rationale of the
larger acquisition of Novescia is to create a new presence in the Rhône-Alpes region encompassing Lyon, the
second-largest city in France, which will allow us to gain broader geographical coverage in our core French
market and to strengthen our business with private hospitals, a significant source of business for Novescia. We
estimate that, as a result of the Acquisition, our consolidated business operations will achieve cost synergies of
approximately € 10 million on an annual run rate basis by mid-2016, primarily relating to the shifting of a
portion of the testing activities carried out by Novescia onto the Company’s platforms, the planned reduction of
administrative costs associated with Novescia’s headquarters and the realization of procurement synergies by
integrating and leveraging our combined scale. However, this synergy estimate is based on a number of
assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such
information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide
variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates. We are also considering more
significant, strategic and transformational combinations, as we believe that one or more of our major European
competitors, including Unilabs, Amedes and Labco (some of which may be larger than us), may be available for
acquisition on attractive terms over the near and intermediate term. We currently have reached no agreement
with respect to any such acquisition and are not in discussions with any of these potential targets.

In the past, we completed a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our geographical coverage and gain
critical mass in markets outside France. Although our acquisition strategy is currently focused on the French
routine market, we may explore opportunities to purchase larger laboratory networks in other European
countries. As such, our focus will be on the most densely populated regions as well as the regions with the
largest number of prescribers.

**_Continue to deliver operating efficiencies_**

We also intend to continue to take advantage of the economies of scale provided by our presence in all three
segments of the laboratory testing market and by the size of our network to streamline our operations and
administrative functions and to control costs. We are aiming in particular at controlling costs through the further
rationalization of our network (in particular in France by establishing technical platforms surrounded by a
sophisticated and condensed network of collection points), the further industrialization and automation of our
processes and the optimization of synergies between our segments and geographies. We also intend to further
leverage our size to obtain favorable commercial conditions from suppliers. In cooperation with our main
logistical partners, we will continue to improve our logistical organization and optimize samples collection and
transportation, seeking logistical synergies between our national and international activities and between our
three business segments. Finally, we will continue to work on the better integration of our laboratories, in
particular with respect to those acquired most recently. In particular, we will seek to optimize our operating
costs through the implementation of group agreements and processes with respect to IT, cars, rentals, external
fees and utilities.

**Our specific corporate structure**

The Company is a société par actions simplifiée organized under French law (formerly 77.8% of the Company’s
share capital and voting rights are owned indirectly through companies organized under the laws of France and

121


-----

Luxembourg controlled by funds associated with PAI, a European private equity firm). The remainder of the
Company’s share capital and voting rights are owned by members of our senior management and clinical
pathologists. For more information on the Company’s shareholders, see “Principal Shareholders and Related
_Party Transactions.”_

We primarily conduct our business through our subsidiaries. Our French subsidiaries, which represented 67.2%
of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, are subject to strict regulations limiting the ownership of
clinical laboratories and the corporate form such laboratories can take. French law requires that a majority of the
voting rights of a laboratory company be held by clinical pathologists working in the relevant laboratory. In
addition, persons that are not clinical pathologists or entities that are not laboratory companies may not own
shares granting more than 25% of the share capital in a laboratory company. French law also dictates that
clinical laboratories must take the corporate form of an SEL. For more information on the regulations affecting
the corporate form and ownership of French clinical laboratories, see “Regulation—Regulations Affecting our
_Routine Lab and Specialized Testing Businesses—France—Laboratory Ownership and Corporate Structure.”_

We have organized our corporate structure to remain in compliance with such regulations. Each of our French
laboratory subsidiaries is organized as an SEL, in accordance with French law. The Company indirectly holds
its interests in all of its French operating subsidiaries through our non-laboratory subsidiary, Cefid, of which the
Company owns approximately 99% of the share capital. In order to comply with SEL ownership restrictions,
our corporate structure in France is such that Cefid holds 25% of the voting rights and share capital in certain of
our French laboratory subsidiaries (currently Cerba Selafa), with the clinical pathologists operating such French
laboratory subsidiaries holding the balance, i.e., a majority, of the share capital and voting rights. The by-laws of
such French laboratory subsidiaries grant approximately 99% of financial rights (rights to receive dividend
payments) to Cefid as regards Cerba Selafa. In addition, Cerba Selafa holds up to 49.9% of the voting rights in
our other French laboratory company subsidiaries, with clinical pathologists operating each such other French
laboratory subsidiary holding a majority of the voting rights. Cerba Selafa also holds between approximately
70% and 99.99% of these subsidiaries’ financial rights.

Clinical pathologists must, under French law, be allowed to exercise their independent judgment in the conduct
of their day-to-day operations. However, we maintain de facto control over our subsidiaries’ actions through
shareholders agreements, according to which major operating decisions (such as, for example, the incurrence of
debt over a specified threshold, corporate mergers, yearly budgeting, entering into contracts that last for longer
than one year or are worth over a specified threshold, among other things) are subject to a vote of controlling
bodies (boards of directors or strategic committees) in which representatives of our subsidiary shareholders have
a veto right. We do not, however, exercise control over the appointment by the subsidiary shareholders of its
representatives in the controlling bodies of the French laboratory subsidiaries, as these decisions can be taken by
the clinical pathologists owning a majority of the voting rights in the subsidiary shareholders. As a result, we are
dependent on the clinical pathologists who hold the majority of the voting rights in our French subsidiaries for
decisions affecting these subsidiaries’ operations. As we acquire new French laboratories, we put into place a
similar shareholding structure and shareholder agreement with the clinical pathologists at the newly acquired
laboratory.

Regulatory restrictions on the ownership of our subsidiaries in Belgium and Luxembourg are much less
stringent than those imposed by French law. As a result, our corporate structure in Belgium and Luxembourg is
relatively simple. We operate our Routine Lab business in Belgium and Luxembourg through subsidiaries
owned directly and indirectly through our wholly-owned subsidiary BARC, through which we also operate our
Central Lab business.

We believe that we are in compliance with all regulatory structuring requirements. However, regulations are
subject to change and we could incur significant expense if a regulatory authority were to take issue with our
structure. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory
_requirements governing our activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our business_
_activities may be negatively impacted, if we fail to comply.”_

**Our businesses**

We operate three business lines: Routine Lab, Specialized Testing and Central Lab.

-----

**_Routine Lab_**

_Overview_

Our Routine Lab business is our largest line of business and accounted for €418.1 million and €405.9 million of
_pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the twelve months ended September 30,_
2014, respectively, representing 72.2% and 70.6% of our total pro forma net sales for the same periods.

We operate our Routine Lab business in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, where we estimate that we are
among the largest clinical private laboratories in terms of revenue. Our Routine Lab business is highly regulated
in each of these jurisdictions, including in terms of price for our services. See “Industry—Clinical Pathology
_Testing—Market Overview” and “Regulation—Regulations Affecting our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing_
_Businesses.”_

_Our Routine Lab services_

Our Routine Lab business performs tests prescribed by doctors and medical institutions in connection with
general patient care to establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise
undiagnosed condition. The most frequently requested tests include:

- blood chemistry analyses;

- urinalyses;

- blood cell counts;

- thyroid tests; and

- cholesterol tests.

In each country, we operate several regional clusters consisting of multiple collection centers served by one or
more technical platforms at which tests are performed. We believe this hub and spoke model provides an
efficient use of our resources. By collecting samples within close proximity to patients’ homes and workplaces,
while centralizing testing equipment and professionals at technical platforms, we are able to reduce equipment
and personnel overhead costs associated with carrying out testing at each collection center. We currently have
around 150 collection sites in France served by eight regional clusters comprising nine technical platforms, 49
collection sites in Belgium served by three technical platforms and 42 collection sites in Luxembourg served by
one technical platform. Our operating model also enables us to automate the testing process and report results
quickly and efficiently. We perform and report the results of most routine procedures within 12 hours of the
collection of the sample, utilizing a variety of sophisticated and computerized laboratory testing instruments at
each of our technical platforms.

Testing is generally organized into three phases: (i) the pre- analytical phase, which includes collecting samples
and delivering them to testing facilities; (ii) the analytical phase, during which the actual test is performed; and
(iii) the post-analytical phase, where results are delivered to the prescribing doctor and the patient and
interpretation assistance is offered by our clinical pathologists.

_Pre-analytical phase. Before clinical testing is performed, samples are collected from the patient, identified and_
delivered to our laboratories. In France and Luxembourg, patient samples are collected directly by the
laboratory, although in more remote areas, samples are collected by nurses who then submit samples to the
laboratory. In Belgium, samples are primarily collected at doctors’ offices and transported to our laboratories for
testing.

_Analytical phase. Once we have logged in the test request and collected the samples, we perform the necessary_
tests. Most of our routine tests are automated, while others must be performed manually by our clinical
pathologists or technicians.

_Post-analytical phase. Our clinical pathologists interpret test results once they become available. Routine_
testing is typically completed within less than 12 hours. Results are transmitted either in hard copy or made
available electronically to patients or doctors via a server.

123


-----

_Our Routine Lab customers_

Customers of our Routine Lab business are individual patients who require routine clinical tests in connection
with the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of different illnesses. Generally, doctors prescribe the relevant tests
to their patients who then go to one of our collection centers.

_Our Routine Lab operations_

_France_

We believe we were the second largest private network of clinical pathology laboratories in France in terms of
revenue, based on management estimates for 2014. We operate eight regional clusters with approximately 150
collection points:

- CBCV, in the Paris area;

- Biolille in the Lille area;

- Biotop in the Marseille area;

- Biobaie in the Saint-Brieuc, Brittany area;

- BioPyrénées Lab (formerly Bioadour) in the Tarbes and Lourdes area in southwestern France;

- Bioréunion in the overseas French département of Réunion;

- Biopole 80 in the Picardie area; and

- CBM in the Normandie area.

We believe that, for the French market in particular, location plays a key role in a clinical laboratory’s success.
Medical doctors in France are prohibited by law from administering laboratory analyses themselves. As a result,
patients are prescribed medical analyses and find a walk-in laboratory or arrange for a nurse or technician to
collect a sample from their home. Patients who travel to a laboratory to have their sample taken typically choose
a laboratory based on proximity to their home or workplace. We have consequently focused on making selective
acquisitions targeted at increasing the density of our footprint in France in order to build a leading position in
the French routine laboratory testing market.

Each of our collection sites in France has an on-site clinical pathologist as required by law. Samples collected
are then sent on to the nearest regional technical platform for testing. We processed approximately 4,100 million
files in France in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, or over 13,500 per day.

Our Routine Lab business in France generated €339.6 million and €331.2 million of pro forma net sales for the
year ended December 31, 2013 and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively, representing
respectively 58.6% and 57.6% of our total Routine Lab pro forma net sales for the same period.

_Belgium and Luxembourg_

We have been active in the Belgian routine laboratory testing market since our acquisition of BARC in 2007.
We believe that we are among the three largest private routine laboratories in Belgium in terms of revenue,
based on management estimates for 2014, performing analyses for public and private hospitals, doctors and
patients.

As of December 31, 2013, we operated in Belgium through three regional clusters:

- CRI, the largest private laboratory in the Ghent area with sites throughout a large part of Flanders;

- LBS, the largest private laboratory in the Brussels area; and

- Medic Lab, which serves Aalst and Sint-Gillis-Waas in Flanders.

124


-----

Our laboratories in Belgium offer a broad range of routine tests. Our samples are collected at the collection
centers that we operate or are collected at doctors’ offices and sent to our laboratories for testing. In the twelve
months ended September 30, 2014, we performed routine tests for approximately 620,000 patients in Belgium,
or over 2,000 per day. We believe that we are the number one private routine ambulatory care laboratory in
Luxembourg. Our routine laboratory testing business in Luxembourg is operated through Ketterthill
Laboratories, which we acquired through our acquisition of LLAM in 2011. We have one technical platform
with 39 collection sites throughout Luxembourg, through which we offer a broad range of routine tests. In 2013,
we performed routine tests for approximately 355,000 patients in Luxembourg, or over 1,100 per day.

Our Routine Lab business in Belgium and in Luxembourg generated collectively €78.5 million and
€74.7 million of pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the twelve months ended
September 30, 2014, respectively, representing 13.6% and 13% of our total Routine Lab pro forma net sales for
the same periods.

_Routine Lab growth through acquisitions_

Both strategic and bolt-on acquisitions have played a key role in the development of our Routine Lab business,
and we expect acquisitions to continue to be an important part of our growth strategy in the future. Before
December 31, 2008, our business consisted of our Specialty Testing business unit, our Central Lab business
unit, as well as our Routine Lab business in Belgium. We have accomplished our Routine Lab growth through
the strategic acquisition of regional clusters, beginning with our acquisition of Biolille in 2009. We have
augmented this development through bolt-on acquisitions of small laboratories that we are able to use as
collection sites to increase our concentration in targeted market areas. Over the past three years, we have
completed 36 separate acquisition transactions, of which 7 were large, strategic acquisitions, mainly consisting
of acquisitions of routine labs in France. In addition, on December 19, 2014, we entered into the Securities
Purchase Agreement with a view to acquiring the Target Group.

We have a two-Phase Investment analysis process. Target selection begins with our dedicated acquisition team
of five professionals, including our chief executive officer, applying specified criteria to identify an attractive
laboratory for acquisition. After evaluating the opportunity for synergies and market conditions in the target’s
region and determining a valuation estimate, the acquisition team presents its findings to an ad hoc Investment
Committee organized to review the acquisition that is typically composed of our CEO, our CFO and a member
of our business development team. Acquisitions with an estimated value greater than € 5 million are also
presented to an ad hoc Executive Committee comprised of our CEO, our CFO and a representative of our
majority shareholder for review. The committee reviewing the proposed transaction, upon consideration of the
potential target’s key financial information and the business rationale for the transaction, decides whether or not
to proceed with the next phase. A favorable decision launches phase two, which entails a more thorough vetting
of the target, including legal, financial and technical due diligence, determination of the appropriate structure for
the transaction and negotiation of an acquisition agreement. Our business development manager, representatives
of our finance department and the head of our routine laboratory testing business unit are all involved heavily in
this phase. Upon completion of this phase, the transaction is once again presented to our Investment Committee
(and to our Executive Committee for acquisitions above €5 million). Their favorable decision then results in the
plan of acquisition being presented to our full board of directors for approval.

Once an acquisition agreement has been signed, our management liaises with clinical pathologists at the target
laboratory to begin the integration process. A team of 20 professionals from our finance, quality control,
purchasing, information technology, human resources, legal and engineering teams work in concert to begin
harmonizing procedures in order to be in a position to rapidly integrate the laboratory after closing.
Approximately six months after closing, management conducts a post-acquisition review during which it tracks
the progress made on the plan put in place by the integration team and the performance of the newly acquired
laboratory in the context of our group-level business plan.

**_Specialized testing_**

_Overview_

Our Specialized Testing business is our historical core business and today our second largest line of business.
Our Specialized Testing business generated €130.5 million and €138.3 million of pro forma net sales for the
year ended December 31, 2013 and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively, representing
22.5% and 24.0% of our total pro forma net sales for the same periods. In France, we are the co-leader in

125


-----

specialized laboratory testing in terms of revenue based on management estimates for 2014, with our main
competitor Biomnis.

We perform all our specialized testing at our laboratory in Saint- Ouen-l’Aumône, France, but collect samples
for testing from over 3,000 collection points throughout France (including collection centers that we own and
operate through our Routine Lab business as well as third-party routine laboratories), elsewhere in Europe, the
Middle East and North Africa. We derived 78.0% of our Specialized Testing net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2013 from samples collected in France. We do not outsource any of our specialized testing to
other laboratories.

Similar to our Routine Lab business, our Specialized Testing business is highly regulated, including in terms of
price for our services in certain jurisdictions. See “Industry—Clinical Pathology Testing—Market Overview”
_and “Regulation—Regulations Affecting our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing Businesses.”_

_Our specialized testing services_

Our Specialized Testing business involves a more complex level of clinical laboratory tests than those provided
through our Routine Lab business. These tests are conducted by highly skilled laboratory professionals and
often require more sophisticated technology, equipment and materials.

Our Specialized Testing services consist of performing specialized tests on behalf of our Routine Lab business
as well as those that are outsourced by other private laboratories and hospitals that do not have the scale, the
expertise or the willingness to perform such tests, particularly due to the equipment needed for such testing and
the lower demand for such testing compared to routine testing. Specialized testing also requires a high level of
scientific and medical expertise, which we have developed since Cerba was established in 1967. Private
laboratories, private hospitals and public hospitals (including most public hospitals in France) outsource their
specialized tests to specialty private laboratories such as us.

_Our specialized testing customers_

Our Specialized Testing client base includes doctors from whom we directly receive samples (primarily in
Belgium), public and private hospitals, as well as other clinical laboratories that choose to outsource their
specialized testing.

We reach clients throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa who choose to send their samples to our
specialized testing facility in France.

Of our Specialized Testing net sales as of December 31, 2013, 22% was attributable to public hospitals and
laboratories and 78% was attributable to the private sector (private hospitals and/or laboratories and/or
ambulatory patients).

_Our specialized testing logistics_

Maintaining an efficient collection and transportation network is key to operating our Specialized Testing
business. We collect samples for testing throughout France, the rest of Europe, the Middle East and North
Africa. These samples are delivered at the same time on a daily basis to our testing facility in
Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France, so that the results are delivered to clients within 24 hours of collection. In the
past, we owned and operated a transportation fleet in order to collect and deliver Specialized Testing samples to
our facility. However, to optimize costs, we have outsourced our specialized testing sample transportation
services to a third-party contractor since 1998. We believe this is a more efficient use of our resources, as it
avoids the need for us to incur capital expenditures on equipment necessary for such logistics, such as a fleet of
vehicles, and eliminates the fixed costs associated with directly employing logistics staff. In addition, the
accreditation requirements with respect to long-distance transportation of medical samples have become more
stringent. As such, we feel confident about outsourcing our transportation to a partner that specializes in this
field. Nevertheless, we maintain strict control over the operations of our logistics network. We employ a
dedicated team in charge of managing our logistics provider to ensure that our logistics provider meets our strict
quality standards, including our 24-hour turnaround time from sample collection to test result delivery. This
team sets routes for the collection of samples and optimizes delivery times to our testing facility to allow for
batches of similar tests to be run at once in order to maximize the efficient use of our equipment and clinical
pathologists’ time. We review our outsourcing arrangements on a regular basis and choose providers through
formal tender procedures. In addition, we have the contractual right to take direct control over our provider’s
dedicated vehicles and logistics personnel in the event of a material problem with the services.

_Our specialized testing operations_

Our Specialized Testing business is structured into three groups: clinical pathology, anatomical pathology and
cytogenetics. We perform approximately 23,000 tests on over 13,000 samples per day through our Specialized
Testing business. Through our clinical pathology group, we are able to perform approximately 1,400 different
specialized clinical pathology tests (one of the largest such offerings in Europe), including:

- screening for genetic disorders such as Down Syndrome;

- immunology (the study of the immune system, including allergies, transplant compatibility, antibodies,
cytokines, immune system cells and their effect, receptor systems and autoimmune diseases);

- virology tests (such as determining a patient’s viral load in order to determine the effectiveness of an
antiviral regimen);

- bacteriology (the study of infectious bacteria);

- hormonology (the study of hormone secretions and their effects on body growth and metabolism); and

- oncology (the study of abnormal cell growth, including benign tumors and cancer).

The clinical pathology group performs approximately 20,500 tests per day from a catalog of approximately
2,500 tests. It accounted for approximately 84.4% and 84.9% of our Specialized Testing pro forma net sales for
the year ended December 31, 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. Our clinical
pathology group performed approximately 5 million tests during the year ended December 31, 2013. A medical
team including approximately 20 clinical pathologists provides support to routine clinical pathologists and
doctors for interpreting the results of the specialized clinical pathology tests we perform.

Our anatomical pathology group performs testing of histologic or cytological samples, mostly for oncology
diagnostic testing purposes. Our offerings in this area range from skin tests and cervical smears to fetal testing.
Our anatomical pathology group performs approximately 1,900 tests per day and accounts for approximately
7.8% and 7.3% of our total Specialized Testing pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 and
the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. Since 2007, test volumes have grown by
approximately 28%, from approximately 380,000 tests conducted in 2007 to approximately 485,000 tests in
2013. The group has a dedicated team of approximately 20 professionals. Our cytogenetics group performs,
among other things, pre- and post-natal genetic screenings, genetic testing related to cancer and blood diseases
as well as general genetic-level testing support for our other groups. The cytogenetics group accounts for
approximately 5.9% of all our Specialized Testing pro forma net sales for both the year ended December 31,
2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. We have a team of seven genetics specialists,
approximately 55 specialized technicians and five medical secretaries dedicated to the operations of this group.

**_Central Lab_**

_Overview_

Our Central Lab business is our third line of business and accounted for €42.8 million and €46.7 million of pro
_forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014,_
respectively, representing 7.4% and 8.1% of our total pro forma net sales for the same periods.

Our Central Lab business is engaged in the testing of the safety and efficacy of new molecules for use in clinical
settings. We operate our Central Lab business through BARC, which we acquired in 2007. BARC has been
engaged in the central laboratory testing business since its creation in 1985. We believe we are a significant
player in the Central Lab market worldwide based on management estimates for 2014. New drugs generally go
through four phases of clinical testing before being marketed to the general public for use. We provide testing to
support the development of new pharmaceuticals generally through Phases II through IV of a drug’s
development. A large proportion of our Central Lab business is derived from Phase II clinical testing. For a
description of the phases of clinical testing for pharmaceuticals, see “Industry—Central Lab.”

127


-----

_Our Central Lab services_

As a reference laboratory for pharmaceutical companies and CROs, we provide clinical trial assistance by
running routine and specialized tests on samples received from patients in such trials. We provide six general
types of services:

- collaboration with clients to develop new tests and define appropriate test panels;

- drug safety testing through hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis;

- drug efficacy testing through laboratory testing of surrogate endpoints (that is, biomarkers that are
indicators of a desired clinical effect);

- pharmacodynamics testing, which measures the effects of a drug on the body;

- pharmacokinetics testing, which measures the effects of the body on a drug; and

- the recording and storing of tests and results that can be used in connection with future testing.

_Our Central Lab customers_

We work for research and development (“R&D”) groups at major drug and pharmaceutical companies to
develop tests to demonstrate a compound’s medical usefulness. We also work for contract research
organizations, or CROs, such as Onyx Scientific, to focus on the testing piece of a pharmaceutical company’s
wide scale R&D efforts. Most of our central laboratory testing business is conducted pursuant to contracts with
pharmaceutical companies. As of September 30, 2014, our top five customers in terms of net sales were Onyx,
Astellas, Gilead, Janssen and Servier, collectively accounting for 42% of our Central Lab net sales. No single
customer represented more than 15% of the sales of our Central Lab business for the year ending December 31,
2013.

In general, our Central Lab customer contracts are linked to a particular clinical trial and last for the duration of
the phase of the trial drug’s development. Contracts fix the fees that we charge for our services over the length
of the clinical trial. We do not enter into exclusivity contracts for clinical testing with any of our Central Lab
customers. Contracts for Central Lab customers vary in duration from six to 60 months, depending on the length
of the particular clinical trial for which our services are needed. Pricing is determined on a per test basis and is
generally fixed, although customers are sometimes offered rebates based on the achievement of specified
volumes of testing. Contracts estimate the volume of tests that will be required, although this is non-binding and
does not represent a commitment to order a specific volume of tests. We are subject to liability if we fail to
perform tests in a timely manner. However, we maintain insurance for any such potential claims and generally
our liability under our Central Lab contracts is limited. Since drug safety authorities receive reports on the
progress of each phase of clinical testing, they may require the modification, suspension or termination of
clinical trials if they conclude that an unwarranted risk is presented to patients or healthy volunteers. Contracts
may be terminated at any time at will by Central Lab customers, without indemnification. In the event that a
customer cancels or terminates a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services
performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent customer-authorized services related to terminating the
cancelled project.

_Our Central Lab operations_

For trials that are based in Europe and South Africa, we perform tests related to our Central Lab business
through our routine and specialized facilities and technical platforms in France, Belgium and Luxembourg.
Additionally, we have logistics and administrative facilities in each of the United States, Australia and
Singapore, where we work with local laboratories to perform our central lab tests. Finally, we have local
partners in China and Japan through which we conduct our entire Central Lab business in these countries.

We are one of the few market participants with both a routine laboratory testing business and a central
laboratory testing business. We leverage this distinguishing characteristic in several ways. First, we are able to
use the lab network and infrastructure that we already have for our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing
businesses for our Central Lab business. This provides us cost savings that we would not necessarily have had if
our Central Lab business was our sole line of business. We are able to pass on such cost savings to customers
and provide Central Lab services at a competitive price. Further, potential Central Lab clients view the expertise

128


-----

that we have developed in the day-to-day operations of our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses as a
sign that we are familiar with the latest testing technology and are capable of effectively carrying out testing on
a large scale.

**Quality standards**

Our different lines of business are generally highly regulated in terms of standard of quality and conduct of our
tests. Our quality assurance efforts mainly focus on correct patient identification of samples, reporting accuracy,
proficiency testing, reference range relevance, process audits, statistical process control and personnel training
for all of our laboratories and collection centers. We also focus on the proper licensing, credentials and training
of our professional and technical staff.

Our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses are subject to national- level regulation that sets quality
standards for our operations. These standards vary across jurisdictions. See “Regulation.” We believe we are in
compliance with applicable accreditation or certification standards of standard- setting bodies, such as the
International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), Comité français d’accréditation (“COFRAC”) in France
and BELAC in Belgium. In addition, our central laboratory business is exposed to regulatory constraints on test
protocols and laboratory upkeep imposed on the pharmaceutical industry. We often agree in contracts with our
clients to meet specific regulatory requirements on our central laboratory testing operations that would not have
otherwise applied directly to us for commercial reasons. For more detail on the regulatory standards to which
our operations are subject, see “Regulation.”

We seek to assure the highest level of quality control throughout our group. We have a group-level Quality
Committee that oversees our several business units. We also have dedicated quality assurance staff for each of
our lines of business: our Routine Lab business (including separate quality assurance teams for our French
Routine Lab business and our Belgium and Luxembourg Routine Lab businesses), our Specialized Testing
business and our Central Lab testing business. Our facilities are subject to periodic external reviews for quality
assurance. For example, our French Routine Lab and Specialty Testing facilities are subject to inspection by
COFRAC every 18 months. Further our Belgian Routine Lab facilities are subject to review and inspection for
adherence to BELAC norms on a periodic basis. Our Central Lab business is subject to periodic review by our
clients to ensure that we are meeting the standards to which we agreed in our contracts. Such reviews occur at
least once during each clinical trial we perform. Finally, we have a dedicated quality control team that monitors
our relationship with our outsourced logistics provider and have put in place contingency measures in the event
of the provider’s material breach of our outsourcing agreement.

**Our suppliers**

The primary equipment and material required to conduct our business are testing equipment and reagents. We
regularly evaluate the equipment (analytical systems and robotic, pre- and post-analytical devices) used by our
business. We own the majority of the equipment necessary to conduct our Routine Lab, Specialized Testing and
Central Lab businesses. We finance equipment acquisitions in the ordinary course of business through loans
secured by the equipment being financed.

In addition to testing equipment, we also use basic materials such as reagents in our business. Our main
suppliers include Roche, Siemens and Abbott. We do not enter into exclusivity contracts with any single
supplier. However, our dedicated buying team crafts framework agreements pursuant to which suppliers are able
to compete for the opportunity to supply our technical platforms with needed chemicals. No single provider is
the source of more than 12% of our supplies for any particular calendar year.

**Billing and payment**

Billing for our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing businesses is a complex process involving several payers.
Depending on the billing arrangement and the applicable law of the country in which we operate, the payer may
be a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients (such as national public health
insurance or a private medical insurance plan), a patient or other party (such as a hospital, another laboratory or
an employer) who outsourced testing to us, or a combination of these parties.

We generally bill for clinical testing services on a fee-for-service basis. In each of the countries in which we
operate our Routine Lab testing business, the rates we can legally charge for routine laboratory tests are set by
regulators. According to “Comptes nationaux de la santé 2013,” in 2013, approximately 72.1% of spending in
the French private clinical pathology testing market was financed by the French social security system and the

129


-----

remainder was covered by private insurance companies (approximately 25.1%) and by the patient directly out of
pocket (approximately 2.8%).

In Belgium, the state healthcare system pays for approximately 90% of the price set by the government, with
patients responsible for the remainder. Belgian regulations also permit laboratories to charge patients a nominal
administrative fee on a per patient basis. In Luxembourg, the entire cost of tests included in the national
regulator’s catalog are paid for by the national healthcare system. Routine tests are almost invariably subject to
price controls and reimbursement from the government.

In France, Belgium and Luxembourg, our Routine Lab patients pay the portion of the fee for which they are
responsible (if any) at the time of service and the remainder is paid to us by the third-party payer (national social
security and/or private supplementary health insurance) generally within 30 days. However, if a routine test is
administered in a non-therapeutic context (that is, if a patient is receiving elective medical treatment), that test
would generally not be covered by government health insurance and the patient would be responsible for the
entire cost of the test.

We have historically billed for our Specialized Testing business in much the same way as routine testing in
France. However, new regulations in France in 2012 required that we invoice a routine laboratory that
outsourced a test to our Specialized Testing business instead of invoicing patients directly. Prices for specialized
tests are generally set by the government, but certain specialized tests that we provide are not on the French
government catalog and therefore do not have a set fee. In such instances, we are free to set our fees on our own
according to market forces. Further, tests done on samples imported from outside countries are not subject to fee
restrictions. For such “export” tests, we generally set our fees taking into account the regulatory fee for the test
in the exporting country, if any. Payments to us by national social security and/or private supplementary health
insurance in the Specialized Testing business are generally made within approximately 60 days after testing.
Payments by public entities, such as hospitals, take longer, running up to 80 days.

Our Central Lab business operates on a traditional contractual model through which we set rates directly with
our clients. We are generally paid promptly for our services by our Central Lab clients.

Although we believe we have no material issues related to collecting fees for our services, we are subject to the
risk of non-payment by patients and other clients. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Financial
_difficulties of certain of our clients or third-party payers may require us to write off debts.” We maintain_
reserves for doubtful accounts and amounts past due.

**Environmental, health and safety**

Our operations are subject to licensing and other requirements under EU, national and local laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment and human and occupational health and safety, including those
requirements governing the handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and biological, infectious
and hazardous waste. All our laboratories are subject to requirements for the disposal of laboratory samples at
authorized facilities and we generally utilize outside vendors for the disposal of such samples. Nevertheless, we
could be held responsible for cleanup of contamination at such sites attributable to our wastes.

In addition, we must meet extensive requirements relating to workplace safety in clinical laboratories,
particularly for employees who could be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B
virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment,
training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and the
transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.

Although we are not aware of any current material non-compliance with our obligations under environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations in connection with our operations, failure to comply with such laws and
regulations in the future could subject us to civil and criminal fines and penalties, remediation costs,
enforcement actions, the suspension or termination of our licenses to operate or third-party claims. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements_
_governing our activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be_
_negatively impacted if we fail to comply.”_

**Information technology systems**

We use information technology systems (or “IT systems”) in virtually all aspects of our business, including
clinical laboratory testing, central laboratory testing, billing, customer service and the management of medical

130


-----

data. We also use our and internal reporting system in order to monitor key performance indicators in each of
our laboratories and adjust our operations accordingly. The successful delivery of our services depends, in part,
on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems, especially when time is of the essence for a
laboratory test result.

Historically, we have grown through acquisitions and as a consequence newly acquired laboratories may not use
software platforms that are consistent with the systems we have implemented on a group-wide basis. Newly
acquired laboratories may continue to use their existing IT systems for an indefinite amount of time after their
acquisition, although we encourage them to adopt one of two pre-approved IT platforms when they consider
changing their systems.

**Facilities**

Our facilities consist primarily of collection centers, technical platforms, our specialized laboratory facility in
Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône, France, and office space. We rent the majority of our premises pursuant to commercial
leases. We believe that our facilities are generally adequate for our present needs and that suitable additional or
replacement space would be available to the extent required.

**Employees**

As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately 2,617 full-time equivalent employees and we employed
approximately 221 clinical pathologists. In France and Belgium, we are subject to collective bargaining
agreements negotiated between unions and employers’ representatives at the national level and made mandatory
pursuant to national labor law. Although we are subject from time to time to minor employment-related
disputes, we believe that overall our relations with our employees are good.

**Intellectual property**

Generally, we do not regard intellectual property to be a material part of our assets or essential to our operations.
Besides copyright protections on our business and trade names, we do not hold any material intellectual property
assets.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance, both on the group level and on the level of each of our individual laboratories, against
various risks related to our business, including mandatory professional civil liability (for which amendments are
made from time to time for laboratories conducting specific activities within the scope of our business, such as
tests related to fertility treatments or prenatal diagnosis), combined property damage and, in respect of certain of
our laboratories, business interruption policies. We have taken out directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for
executives within our group. We also maintain applicable compulsory workers’ compensation and motor
liability coverage.

We believe that our existing insurance policies are adequate in terms of both amounts covered and conditions of
coverage to cover the major risks of our business, taking into account the cost of insurance coverage and the
potential risks to business operations. However, there can be no assurance that no losses will be incurred or that
this coverage will be sufficient to cover the cost of defense or damages in the event of a significant claim. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance.”

**Legal proceedings**

We have been involved, and may be involved in the future, in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business, including disputes concerning professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as
inquiries from governmental agencies and health insurance carriers regarding, among other things, billing
issues. Additionally, we operate in a regulated industry. As such, in the ordinary course of business, we are
subject to national and local regulatory scrutiny, supervision and controls. For more information on the
regulations governing our business, see “Regulation.”

On January 13, 2014, Mr. Jean-Luc Dourson and Biopart (a company wholly-owned by Mr. Dourson) initiated
proceedings against us before the Paris Commercial Court (tribunal de commerce de Paris). The complainants
are seeking rescission of the relevant contracts of sale of LLAM (owner of Luxembourg-based Ketterthill
laboratory) which we acquired on June 6, 2011. The complainants argue that we did not fulfil our obligations
under the contracts of sale and that rescission may be granted pursuant to Article 1184 of the French Civil Code.

131


-----

We are vigorously defending the allegations and believe them to be without merit and consequently have not
made any provision on our balance sheet for this litigation proceeding. LLAM is a Guarantor of the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Notes and the shares of LLAM are pledged under the Existing Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. If the sale of LLAM were rescinded, the Notes would no longer be guaranteed by LLAM and
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would no longer benefit from the pledge of the shares of LLAM under
the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

One of our subsidiaries, BARC Finance, has been involved in a dispute with the Belgian tax authorities in
connection with its payment of corporate income tax. Although BARC Finance paid the disputed amount of
corporate tax for the taxable period ended December 31, 2008 (€1.4 million, including a 10% penalty), we do
not believe this claim will have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

132


-----

**Regulation**

We are subject to extensive government regulation in each of the countries in which we operate across our lines
of business. Regulations that pertain to operating requirements, professional qualifications of laboratory
personnel, constraints on the ownership of clinical laboratories (which are especially strict in France), and
pricing and reimbursement levels of clinical laboratory tests affect our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing
businesses. In addition, our Central Lab business is subject to further regulations that particularly concern drug
safety.

We are also affected by numerous other laws and regulations that impose restrictions and requirements on the
handling and storing of certain chemicals and reagents as well as the disposal of biological refuse, govern the
handling and storing of personal data and aim to prevent fraud to social security systems.

**Regulations affecting our routine lab and specialized testing businesses**

The activities we undertake as part of our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations are regulated on the
national level in each of the three countries in which we operate.

**_France_**

_Pricing and reimbursement_

With respect to pricing and reimbursement, clinical laboratories are bound by the prices set by the Ministry of
Health and the National Health Insurance Fund (Caisse Nationale d’Assurance Maladie). Prices are revised
annually through negotiations among the Ministry of Health, the National Health Insurance Fund and clinical
pathologists’ labor unions. Over the past three years, tariffs for clinical laboratory testing have decreased by
approximately €100 million per year. We expect further downward pressure on tariffs in France going forward
as the government endeavors to further reduce the rate of growth of national healthcare expenditures, although
we are unable to be certain of the extent of any future reductions.

According to “Comptes nationaux de la santé 2013,” in 2013, approximately 72.1% of spending in the French
private clinical pathology testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder
was covered by private insurance companies (approximately 25.1%) and by the patient directly out of pocket
(approximately 2.8%). This split has not materially changed in recent years.

The reimbursement of tests by the French National Health Insurance is subject to an agreement with the
National Health Insurance Fund, which must be entered into by clinical laboratories and each of the pathologists
practicing within the laboratory. Any failure of one of the pathologists or of the laboratory to comply with the
terms of the aforementioned agreement may lead to the suspension of reimbursement by the National Health
Insurance Fund (déconventionnement).

_Quality and accreditation standards_

French law requires an administrative authorization (autorisation administrative) for the establishment and
operation of clinical laboratories. As part of the authorization process, local health authorities review a filing
detailing the laboratory’s corporate form and governance, premises, equipment, tests, and operating procedures,
as well as the professional qualifications of the laboratory’s personnel, including clinical pathologists. The law
sets minimal standards to be met in each of these areas. A laboratory must inform local health authorities of
changes affecting any of the above matters.

Pursuant to an ordinance dated January 13, 2010 (ordonnance n° 2010-49 relative à la biologie médicale),
which was ratified by law n° 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 related to the reform of medical biology, the
existing administrative authorization process will be replaced after November 1, 2020 (with two intermediary
steps in 2016 and 2018, concerning respectively 50% and 70% of the tests performed by a laboratory) by a new
accreditation procedure to be carried out by a national accreditation body (the Comité français d’accréditation,
or “COFRAC”). The accreditation procedure introduces new, stricter requirements for clinical laboratories
pursuant to standards promulgated by the ISO (namely, ISO 15189). The ordinance provides for a transitional
regime, whereby:

- until November 1, 2020, a non-accredited clinical laboratory may operate on the basis of its administrative
authorization, and remains subject to the regulatory requirements described above relating to, notably,
premises, equipment and mandatory minimums on the number of clinical pathologists. However, the

133


-----

administrative authorization will be withdrawn if by November 1, 2016, the laboratory has not been
accredited for 50% of the tests it performs or if, by November 1, 2018, the laboratory has not been
accredited for 70% of the tests it performs, and if, by November 1, 2020, the laboratory has not been
accredited for 100% of the tests it performes; and

- since November 1, 2013, a non-accredited clinical laboratory is required to demonstrate that it has
effectively begun the new accreditation process.

The COFRAC may suspend or revoke a laboratory’s accreditation for all or part of the laboratory’s business if
such laboratory fails to comply with the requisite health, safety and quality standards. Furthermore, French law
provides for substantial fines and penalties if the regulatory requirements for the grant of administrative
authorizations and/or accreditation are breached.

There is a no limit under French law as to the number of branch offices that a laboratory incorporated as a
company may operate. However, a laboratory company may not open branch offices in more than three
contiguous territoires de santé and for each branch office, at least one clinical pathologist shall be appointed to
enable a speedy medical support to each branch office (meaning that a laboratory company must have at least as
many clinical pathologists as branch offices). Furthermore, regional health authorities (agences régionales de
_santé) may further deny authorization for new clinical laboratories (or new branch offices of existing_
laboratories) within a given geographic area (territoire de santé) if the proposed laboratory’s testing operations
would cause the offer of testing operations to exceed by 25% the relevant territory’s testing needs. Health
authorities may also veto acquisitions of laboratory companies or branch offices, or mergers of laboratory
companies if the share of the tests performed by the consolidated laboratory would exceed 25% of the total
number of tests performed in the relevant territory. Furthermore, the acquisition of shares of a laboratory
company is prohibited if such acquisition would result in the acquiror controlling, directly or indirectly, the
performance of more than 33% of the tests performed in the relevant territory.

French law also limits the number of tests that can be outsourced by a clinical laboratory to other laboratories
every year to 15% of the total number of tests it conducts. This limitation does not apply to the outsourcing of
tests between branch offices of a single clinical laboratory company. The outsourcing of tests is monitored by
the regional health authorities and the absence of representation or misrepresentation concerning outsourced
activities may give rise to administrative sanctions.

_Professional licensing and ethics_

Clinical pathologists, technicians and laboratory personnel collecting patient samples must meet certain
minimum professional qualifications.

In France, each clinical laboratory must be supervised during business hours by at least one clinical pathologist
who acts as the legal representative of the laboratory company and is responsible for its operations, including
the processing of tests outsourced to other laboratories. Clinical pathologists must be registered with the
pharmacists’ professional association (Ordre des Pharmaciens) or the medical doctors’ professional association
(Ordre des Médecins, together, the “Ordres”), depending on whether they are qualified as pharmacists or
medical doctors. Through their membership in an Ordre, clinical pathologists working in clinical laboratories
are subject to the same rules of professional conduct as medical doctors and pharmacists set by the relevant
_Ordre. Laboratory companies must also be registered with one or both Ordres, based on the professional_
affiliation of the clinical pathologists practicing within such laboratories.

The Ordre des Pharmaciens and the Ordre des Médecins are self-regulatory bodies with administrative and
disciplinary powers over practicing professionals. They also represent, respectively, the collective interests of
pharmacists and medical doctors (including in both cases, clinical pathologists) before French public authorities
and may be called upon to issue opinions (avis) on certain issues involving their profession, including proposed
laws and regulations. The Ordres also monitor compliance by practicing professionals with applicable laws and
regulations.

Among the professional conduct rules enforced by the Ordre des Pharmaciens is the principle of independence
defined in Article R.4235-18 of the French Public Health Code. Pursuant to this principle, a pharmacist may not
be subject to any financial, commercial, technical or moral constraint, if such constraint could impair his or her
professional independence. A similar provision affecting medical doctors, Article R.4127-5 of the French Public
Health Code, provides that a medical doctor cannot, in any manner or form, compromise his or her professional
independence.

134


-----

The Ordre des Pharmaciens and the Ordre des Médecins regulate access to the profession by maintaining
respective national registries of practicing professionals (each, a Tableau de l’Ordre), on which every practicing
pharmacist or medical doctor, as well as every clinical laboratory company, must be registered. New clinical
laboratories, including entities formed by the merger of preexisting laboratories, must apply for registration on
the relevant Tableau de l’Ordre as a prerequisite to obtaining administrative authorization. An Ordre may
withhold or suspend registration due to violation of the relevant professional conduct rules.

Clinical laboratories are subject to ongoing regulatory supervision by each of the Ordres and, as a consequence,
must submit to the relevant Ordre for review any proposed change in their capital ownership or articles of
association, any cooperation contracts entered into with other clinical laboratories and, more generally, any
agreements relating to their operations or governing the relations between their shareholders. Upon its review,
the Ordre may inform regional health authorities of any perceived regulatory violations. The regional health
authorities are not bound by the findings of the relevant Ordre in this respect. As part of its disciplinary powers,
each professional association may impose disciplinary sanctions on clinical pathologists, including the
temporary or permanent suspension of practicing professionals who have breached professional conduct rules.

It is worth mentioning that, following a complaint lodged by Labco, it has recently been found by the General
Court of the European Union that the Ordre des Pharmaciens had restricted competition on the clinical biology
analysis market by adopting a restrictive interpretation of French regulations in order to prevent groups of
laboratories from developing in France (Judgment of 10th December 2014, Case T-90/11, Ordre national des
_pharmaciens and Others v Commission). This decision has been appealed by the Ordre des Pharmaciens._

Regional health authorities in France monitor compliance by clinical laboratories with health and safety
regulations through on-site inspections. In addition, certain tests or categories of tests are controlled by
specialized agencies as part of a yearly quality control program. Regional health authorities may impose
administrative sanctions on clinical laboratories and, in certain instances, clinical pathologists, for violations of
certain regulatory requirements, including health, safety and quality regulations. These sanctions range from
fines to the temporary or permanent closing of the laboratory, in the case of particularly serious or repeated
violations.

Certain illegal activities, including the illegal practice of clinical biology (exercice illégal des fonctions de
_biologiste médical) and the misleading use of the title of clinical pathologist by a person without the legal right_
to do so (usage sans droit de la qualité de biologiste medical), carry criminal penalties that range from the
prohibition to practice clinical biology or operate a clinical laboratory to imprisonment for individuals.

In addition, clinical laboratories may not advertise their services, directly or indirectly, to the general public.
Certain information provided to medical doctors is, however, excluded from this prohibition, notably
information of a medical or scientific nature, and upon opening of a new laboratory, the public announcement of
the laboratory’s existence, location, and test offerings.

_Laboratory ownership and corporate structure_

French law also contains specific provisions dealing with the corporate form through which a clinical laboratory
can be operated and imposes limitations on who can hold the capital stock and exercise the voting rights within
such corporations. These provisions and limitations reflect the traditional view in France that clinical
laboratories are engaged in medical activity conducted through small, privately owned entities by independent
professionals (profession libérale).

Owners of a clinical laboratory who do not want to operate their laboratory directly can incorporate their
business through a non-profit organization, a société civile professionnelle (SCP), a cooperative undertaking or a
_société d’exercice libéral (SEL). SELs can take several forms: société d’exercice libéral à responsabilité limitée_
(SELARL), société d’exercice libéral à forme anonyme (SELAFA), société d’exercice libéral en commandite
_par actions (SELCA) or société d’exercice libéral par actions simplifiée (SELAS). Another specific corporate_
form is the société de participations financières de professions libérales (SPFPL), which cannot directly operate
a clinical laboratory but may serve as a holding company for SELs. All our French clinical laboratories are
incorporated as SELAFA or SELAS.

The following principles apply to SELs in general:

- a clinical pathologist can only act as a responsible clinical pathologist for, and therefore manage, one SEL;

135


-----

- more than half of the share capital and the voting rights must be held by clinical pathologists practicing
within the SEL or by an SPFPL constituted by the clinical pathologists practicing within the SEL. French
law used to provide for an exception whereby more than 50% of the share capital of a laboratory company
could be held by individuals or legal entities which were external clinical pathologists or laboratory
companies if these individuals or entities had an activity within the corporate purpose of the laboratory
company considered or were SPFPL. However, law n° 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 related to the reform
of medical biology has removed this exception, such change only affecting laboratory companies set up
after its enactment, i.e. after May 31, 2013. Consequently, any laboratory company set up after that date is
subject to the following limitation regarding its ownership: more than 50% of its share capital and voting
rights must be held, directly or indirectly through an SPFPL, by clinical pathologists working within the
laboratory company considered. With regards to laboratory companies set up prior to May 31, 2013, which,
at that date, did not comply with this requirement, they can still benefit from the former exception regarding
ownership by external clinical pathologists and laboratory companies. However, in case of transfer of their
shares, priority shall be given to clinical pathologists working within the laboratory company considered. If
the latter are unable to buy such shares, said shares can be sold to any external clinical pathologist or
laboratory company or SPFPL, or—within the limitations provided by law for the shareholding of
laboratory companies by non-biologists—to persons that are not clinical pathologists and legal entities that
are not laboratory companies;;

- persons that are not clinical pathologists and legal entities that are not laboratory companies cannot directly
hold more than 25% of the share capital and voting rights of an SEL; to prevent conflicts of interest, certain
types of professionals or entities (including other health professionals, medical suppliers and insurance
companies) are prevented from holding shares in an SEL directly or indirectly;

- the articles of association of laboratory companies may provide for the inalienability of shares for a period
not exceeding ten years; and

- finally, in order to be binding, all arrangements concerning laboratory companies or their shareholders that
are not contained in the by-laws must be disclosed to, as the case may be, the Ordre des Pharmaciens
and/or the Ordre des Médecins.

Certain aspects of the legal framework described above have been considered by the European Court of Justice.
In March 2009, the European Commission commenced a proceeding against France, challenging two provisions
of French law. First, the Commission argued that the 25% ownership limitations placed on third-party
non-professionals imposed an undue burden on the freedom of establishment provided for in the Treaty
Establishing the European Community. Second, the Commission criticized as overly restrictive the rule by
which qualified entities or individuals could not own shares in more than two SELs. In its December 16, 2010
decision, the European Court of Justice found in favor of France on the first count, holding that the ownership
limitations placed on non-professionals were reasonable in view of the state’s legitimate public health and safety
concerns. The Court noted the threat to such independence that might arise from financial pressures placed on
clinical pathologists by third-party investors and found that a Member State might validly conclude that the
professional independence of clinical pathologists would not be adequately preserved in structures where such
professionals would only hold a minority of the share capital, regardless of whether they were granted majority
voting rights. The Court found against France on the second count, however, holding that the ownership
restriction placed by existing regulations on qualified professionals was unnecessary and disproportionate to the
public health objectives sought to be achieved. Pursuant to decree n° 2013-117 dated February 5, 2013 related to
the conditions of operation of a laboratory by an SEL, individuals or legal entities who have an activity within
the corporate purpose of the SEL are no longer subject to the limitation according to which they could not own
shares in more than two SELs.

**_Belgium_**

_Laboratory ownership and corporate structure_

The conditions with respect to ownership and corporate structure which clinical laboratories must comply with
are set forth in Royal Decree No. 143 of December 30, 1982. In the case of clinical laboratories operated by
individuals, there is an explicit prohibition on the operation of such laboratories by doctors who dispense
prescriptions. Such doctors are also barred from acting as directors, associates (vennoten/associés), members,
managers (zaakvoerders/gérants) or designated representatives of clinical laboratory companies.

136


-----

Legal form of ownership represents the primary regulatory constraint on the establishment and operation of
clinical laboratories. These regulatory constraints are provided by the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 (the
“Royal Decree”). The Royal Decree lists the legal forms that clinical laboratory companies should take in order
to eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public health insurance system. The duration of this Royal Decree,
which was initially due to expire on December 31, 2009, has been extended retrospectively until December 31,
2012 by a Decree of January 27, 2010. To date, no new extension has been enacted. The relevant agencies have
not shown any indication that reimbursements would cease. The current legal gap should be filled by a new
Decree which, as for January 2015, is still in a draft form and should be submitted to the Belgian government
for approval. According to oral sources at the INAMI, this draft Decree (i) will leave unchanged the four legal
forms that clinical laboratories should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public health
insurance system and (ii) will provide that these rules are no longer subject to expiration. However, this
information has been obtained by unofficial sources at the INAMI. It is currently unclear whether the draft
Decree will be adopted and, if so, what its content will be. The absence of any form of extension of the duration
of the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 could have a significant impact on all Belgian laboratories run under the
same corporate form as ours, including us. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business—We are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may_
_face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be negatively impacted if we fail to_
_comply.”_

The Royal Decree specifies that, in addition to hospitals, universities and other public bodies, only certain legal
entities may operate clinical laboratories, namely civil companies incorporated in the form of a BVBA/SPRL
(besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid/société privée à responsabilité limitée), a general
partnership (vennootschap onder firma/société en nom collectif), a cooperative company (cooperative
_vennootschap/société coopérative) or a non-profit organization (vereniging zonder winstoogmerk/personne_
_morale sans but lucratif)._

The provisions of Belgian company law applicable to Belgian companies that are eligible to operate clinical
laboratories in accordance with the Royal Decree impose certain restrictions on the transferability of the shares
of such companies. For example, any contemplated transfer of shares in a BVBA/SPRL must be consented to by
half of the shareholders holding shares representing 75% of the capital of the company (minus the value of the
shares which are being transferred). There are no requirements as to the legal form of an entity purchasing
shares of a BVBA/SPRL. Belgian law does not provide for any specific rules with respect to the voting rights
attached to the shares of a laboratory company.

In addition to restrictions on corporate form and share transferability, Belgian law sets forth additional general
regulations affecting a laboratory company’s conduct. Among other things, such rules stipulate that:

- the laboratory company must not have a corporate or statutory purpose other than the operation of clinical
laboratories;

- the articles of association of a laboratory company must include a provision to the effect that the company
is required to strive for a standard of quality that avoids any act entailing complementary expenses which
are not justified by the compulsory healthcare insurer, by the patient or by the persons who insure the
payment of these services (to the extent that the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 remains applicable after
January 1, 2013);

- the laboratory company is required to ensure, in a written agreement (subject to approval by the Ministry of
Social Affairs and Health) with any persons performing services on its behalf, that such persons are free to
perform such services as they wish and will have access to all means necessary to guarantee the quality of
the services rendered;

- the laboratory company is required to organize a central collection of fees and other compensations paid by
patients or third parties; and

- the laboratory company may not accord any benefits, directly or indirectly, to medical professionals who
dispense prescriptions, and it may not influence these professionals in any way.

The laboratory company must provide the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health with an annual list of its
members or associates (vennoten/associés) and must maintain accounting records, prepared in accordance with
accounting standards set by the Royal Decree of November 18, 1983.

137


-----

_Pricing and reimbursement_

Prices and reimbursement levels for laboratory tests are set on an annual basis. Reimbursements are only
granted to clinical laboratories that have been accredited by the Belgian government. Currently, the pricing
system includes a “claw-back” mechanism which allows the Belgian government to recover budgetary
overspend in future periods. Reimbursement levels for tests included in the INAMI catalog are set by the
Belgium health authorities. In certain cases, laboratories are allowed to bill a small supplemental administrative
fee per patient in addition to the set price for a test. Laboratory tests that are prescribed for non-therapeutic
reasons may be excluded from INAMI’s price regulation and are set freely by individual laboratories.

_Quality and accreditation standards_

INAMI also requires that clinical laboratories operating in Belgium must meet certain operational standards set
forth by BELAC, the Belgian national accreditation organization. Laboratories are subject to an inspection,
every year during the first 3-year period of accreditation, and minimum three times (every 18 months at the
latest) during the following 5-year period of accreditation, to verify that they are operating in conformity with
BELAC standards.

**_Luxembourg_**

_Pricing and reimbursement_

According to article 65 of the Luxembourg Social Security Code, prices and reimbursement rules are set by the
applicable nomenclature, which is set forth by grand-ducal regulations on the basis of recommendations of the
Nomenclature Commission (“Commission de Nomenclature”). The list of tests that are reimbursed is set forth
by a nomenclature. Other provisions, such as the statutes of the National Health Fund (“Caisse Nationale de
_Santé”), also apply._

For patients who are affiliated to the National Health Fund (“Caisse Nationale de Santé”), the Luxembourg
social security system covers 100% of the costs of the laboratory tests (except for those performed in a hospital)
that are (i) on the nomenclature list, (ii) carried out, subject to certain exceptions, within two months as of the
date of the medical prescription related to the tests and (iii) carried out by laboratories authorized or covered by
a convention concluded with the National Health Fund (“Caisse Nationale de Santé”), at the price set forth by
the nomenclature. Laboratory tests performed for research purposes are not reimbursed by the Luxembourg
social security system.

_Quality and accreditation standards_

Pursuant to article 3 of the Luxembourg law dated July 16, 1984 regarding clinical laboratories, as modified,
(the “1984 Law”), the opening and operation of clinical laboratories are subject to an administrative
authorization delivered by the Luxembourg Ministry of Health upon the opinion (avis) of the Medical Board
(Collège Médical) and the Consultative Commission of the Laboratories (Commission Consultative des
_Laboratoires)._

This administrative authorization will be delivered (i) if the creation of the laboratory responds to a need on the
national, regional or local plan and (ii) if the requirements set forth by the 1984 Law and its implementing
regulations are met. Mostly, these requirements are related to the specific qualifications of the person or persons
running the clinical laboratory (see “—Professional Licensing and Ethics” below), in relation with the field of
activity of the laboratory.

Any change in this respect (change of field of activity or change of the responsible person or persons) must be
notified to the Ministry of Health. Such a change would require that a new administrative authorization be
obtained. The administrative authorization can be revoked at any time by a motivated decision of the Ministry of
Health if the legal and regulatory requirements abovementioned are no longer met.

The overall control of the clinical laboratories is provided by doctors, engineers and pharmacist-inspectors of
the Health Direction (Direction de la Santé), who act as investigating officers during the execution of their
mission. They may be accompanied by experts.

Clinical laboratories must also submit to quality controls which are conducted by public or private organisms
accredited by the Ministry of Health upon the opinion (avis) of the Consultative Commission of the Laboratories
(Commission Consultative des Laboratoires).

138


-----

Besides this administrative authorization, a clinical laboratory is bound to respect certain operational and quality
standards set forth by the grand-ducal Regulation dated May 27, 2004 setting the minimum criteria to be met
regarding the general activities of clinical laboratories.

Infringements of the abovementioned provisions of the 1984 Law and its implementing regulations are
punishable by criminal sanctions set forth by article 15 of the 1984 Law.

Pursuant to the law of 4 July 2014 on reorganization of the Luxembourg Institute of Normalization,
Accreditation, Safety and Quality of Products and Services (“Institut luxembourgeois de la normalisation, de
_l’accréditation, de la sécurité et qualité des produits et services, ILNAS”) and on organization of the general_
framework for the supervision of the market in the context of the marketing of products and the grand-ducal
Regulation dated December 28, 2001 creating the Luxembourg Accreditation and Surveillance Office (“Office
_Luxembourgeois d’Accréditation et de Surveillance, OLAS”), a clinical laboratory can apply to obtain a_
certification of compliance with the standard ISO 15189.

_Laboratory ownership and corporate structure_

Pursuant to the 1984 Law, operators of a clinical laboratory can be either one or more individuals, or a private or
public corporate entity.

Hospitals which are compelled to operate a clinical laboratory under the form of a hospital service can share a
common structure in order to operate their services together. The individuals or the entities described above can
become partners in this common structure in order to participate in the clinical laboratory’s activities which are
linked to the hospital sector.

Pursuant to the 1984 Law, the following entities may not become partners in, or own, directly or indirectly, a
part of the share capital of, a corporate entity operating a medical laboratory:

- doctors, dentists, and other health professionals authorized to prescribe medical tests, except managers of
clinical laboratories as described below;

- hospitals, without prejudice to the possibility to share a common structure as described above; and

- members of the managing body of a hospital or persons who directly or indirectly own a part of the share
capital of the managing body of a hospital.

When the laboratory is operated by one or more physical person(s), such person(s) act in the capacity of
director(s) of the laboratory and are bound to effectively and personally perform their duties in a responsible
manner. Managers of clinical laboratories are not allowed to perform their duties in several clinical laboratories
at the same time, or carry out another regular professional activity other than

- medical treatments and pharmaceutical prescriptions directly related to biology, and

- teaching functions on an ancillary basis.

Exemptions may be exceptionally granted by the Ministry of Health, upon the opinion (avis) of the Consultative
Commission of the Laboratories (“Commission Consultative des Laboratoires”).

Corporate entities operating a clinical laboratory must appoint one or more managers of a laboratory with the
same duties as described above.

_Professional licensing and ethics_

Any clinical laboratory must be placed under the supervision of a person (a manager as described above) who
acts as the legal representative of the laboratory company and is responsible for its operations.

This manager must either be qualified as a doctor, a pharmacist or a chemist (in this latter case by holding a
Master’s degree in chemistry, biochemistry or the equivalent).

Pursuant to the grand-ducal Regulation dated December 18, 1998 setting the disciplines of a clinical laboratory
and regulating the specialized trainings of laboratories managers, as modified, the doctor, pharmacist or chemist
in charge of a laboratory must in addition have relevant qualifications in the field of biomedical analysis (at least

139


-----

five years full time training) and a specialization in the field for which the administrative authorization is to be
granted and in which the laboratory will operate (medical chemistry, hematology, microbiology or anatomical
pathology). The manager of a clinical laboratory must apply for a prior authorization which is granted by the
Ministry of Health. The authorization will be assessed based mainly on the above qualification requirements.
The attributions of the laboratory technicians and technical medical assistants are determined by the laws and
regulations regarding these professions.

The personnel of the laboratory must be able to reach a manager at any time during the operating hours of the
laboratory. A minimal level of staffing of the laboratory may also be required, depending upon the annual
activity of the laboratory. Further, a minimum set of facilities are required in the laboratory in order to preserve
the dignity and the anonymity of the patients, in particular in relation to facilities used for the collection of
patients’ samples. All results of tests must be kept on file for a duration of ten years.

**Regulations affecting our Central Lab business**

Although our Central Lab business is global in scope, we conduct testing in the same laboratory facilities that
we use for our Routine Lab and Specialized Testing operations. As a result, the regulations described above also
affect our Central Lab business.

Additionally, our global footprint in the Central Lab business exposes us to a wide variety of further regulations
designed to ensure the quality and integrity of testing processes across many different jurisdictions. We believe
that our operating procedures are in accordance with the regulations and guidelines appropriate to each
applicable jurisdiction.

We may voluntarily subject ourselves to certain international operating norms or regulatory standards through
commercially negotiated provisions in the contracts governing our business relationships with our clients. These
may include industry standards for conducting preclinical laboratory testing embodied in Good Laboratory
Practice (“GLP”) standards and those central laboratory operations standards required by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Department of Health in the United Kingdom, the European Agency for
the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (“EMEA”) in Europe and by similar regulatory authorities in other parts
of the world. Our clinical testing may also be subject to industry standards for the conduct of clinical research
and development studies that are embodied in the regulations for Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”). The FDA,
EMEA and other regulatory authorities require that test results submitted to such authorities be based on studies
conducted in accordance with GCP. As with GLP and Good Manufacturing Practice, noncompliance with GCP
can result in the disqualification of data collected during a clinical trial.

**Related party transactions**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we render services to our affiliates and other related parties. In
turn, such related parties may render services to us as part of their business. For example, as a part of the
ordinary course of our Specialized Testing business, we conduct specialized laboratory tests for routine
laboratories that we operate as part of our Routine Lab business and that are owned and operated directly by our
operating subsidiaries. We believe that all transactions with affiliated companies and persons are negotiated and
conducted on a basis equivalent to those that would have been achievable on an arm’s-length basis and that the
terms of these transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated third parties.

The Company has also engaged in various financing transactions with our shareholders.

Investments, one of Frenchco’s shareholders, and Jean-Michel Damien, an indirect shareholder of the Senior

**Description of other indebtedness**

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our_
_indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the_
_underlying documents._

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

On January 18, 2013, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
between, inter alios, Natixis as agent (the “Revolving Agent”) and Wilmington Trust (London) Limited as
Security Agent. Under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a borrower
and guarantor, and certain of our subsidiaries are also borrowers and guarantors (as applicable).

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for a Revolving Credit Facility of up to €50 million, which
will be used for Permitted Acquisitions (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and towards the
general corporate and working capital purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), but will not be used for repaying,
purchasing or otherwise acquiring the Notes or any senior notes, the payment of any dividend or any other
distribution in respect of share capital, nor any acquisition of a company, business or undertaking other than a
Permitted Acquisition. In addition, and in connection with the Acquisition, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will provide on the Completion Date for a one-time increase to the total commitments in an amount
not exceeding €30 million, subject to certain conditions and at all times the commitments may be further
increased to an amount which will not result in the total commitments exceeding the lower of (i) 65% of
Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, including Pro Forma
EBITDA for acquisitions and taking into account cost savings derived therefrom) for the relevant period and
(ii) € 200 million, subject to certain conditions.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on January 31, 2019.

Subject to certain conditions, we may voluntarily prepay our utilizations and/or permanently cancel all or part of
the available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by giving five business days’ (or such shorter
period as the required majority of lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement agree) prior notice to
the Revolving Agent. We may reborrow amounts repaid, subject to certain conditions, until one month prior to
maturity.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires mandatory prepayment
in full or in part in certain circumstances, including, subject to certain conditions, following a Notes Repurchase
(as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), if all or substantially all of the assets of the group are
sold to a person that is not a member of the group, an Adverse Corporate Decision (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement) occurs or upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement). The “Change of Control” definition in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is
generally more expansive than the “Change of Control” definition contained in the Existing Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and, accordingly, certain events giving rise to a Change of Control under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control for purposes of the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

**_Interest and fees_**

The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR or (for loans in euro)
EURIBOR plus certain mandatory costs and a margin that will be 3.75% per annum. The margin may be
reduced by reference to a Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). We are also
required to pay a commitment fee, quarterly in arrears, on available but unused commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement at a rate of 40% of the applicable margin. We are also required to pay an
arrangement fee and certain fees to the Revolving Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the
Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Security and guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is the original borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving
Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Guarantors (including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) under the Revolving

147


-----

Credit Facility Agreement, and (subject to certain agreed security principles set out in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) is secured by senior security over the shares in the Guarantors held by members of the
group and over certain assets of the Guarantors as further described in the section entitled “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Security.” In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility is secured by senior security over_
the shares of Holdco and Luxco and over certain assets of Holdco and the Luxembourg Security Providers, as
further described in the section entitled “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.”

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary positive and negative covenants (including
restrictive covenants that will largely replicate those contained in the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture),
subject to certain agreed exceptions.

One of these covenants requires the group to observe a Percentage Test (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) in relation to the Guarantors subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to this test, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer has to ensure that:

a) the aggregate (without double counting) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (calculated
on a LTM basis on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement), taking each entity on an unconsolidated basis and excluding all intra-group items and investments
in subsidiaries of any member of the group) of the Guarantors exceeds 85% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the
group; and

b) the aggregate gross assets (taking each entity on an unconsolidated basis without double
counting and excluding goodwill and all intra-group items and investments in subsidiaries of any member of the
group) of the Guarantors exceeds 85% of the consolidated gross assets of the group,

in each case, by reference to most recent annual financial statements delivered to the Revolving Agent and the
quarterly financial statements delivered to the Revolving Agent in respect of the financial quarter ending on
June 30 in each financial year and in respect of any financial quarter in which a Significant Acquisition (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) takes place.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the group to observe a leverage covenant. In this respect,
the group’s financial and operating performance is monitored by a financial covenant, which requires us to
ensure that the group’s maximum Leverage Ratio (calculated as the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to
Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA, each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) does not
exceed: 6.00:1 as at the end of each relevant period up to September 30, 2014, 5.75:1 as at the end of each
relevant period up to September 30, 2015 and 5.50:1 as at the end of the relevant period ending on
December 31, 2015 and thereafter. This financial covenant will be tested quarterly on a rolling 12-month basis.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires the provision of customary financial and other
information to the Revolving Lenders.

**_Events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to
agreed grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications), including a cross-default with respect to an event of
default under, and as defined in, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the occurrence of which would
allow the Revolving Lenders to accelerate all or part of the outstanding utilizations and/or terminate their
commitments and/or declare all or part of their utilizations payable on demand and/or declare that cash cover in
respect of ancillary facilities and outstanding letters of credit is immediately due and payable or is payable on
demand and/or instruct the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral.

**_Governing law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law although the restrictive covenants and
certain events of default, which are included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and largely replicate
those contained in the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, are construed in accordance with New York law
(without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

Capitalized terms used in this description shall have the meanings given to them in this description, in priority to
any defined term elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, and if not so defined in this description shall have
the meanings given to such term elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indenture on January 31, 2013, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain other entities entered into the Intercreditor Agreement to govern the
relationships and relative priorities among: (i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving
Lenders”); (ii) any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to certain hedging
agreements (collectively, the “Hedging Agreements” and any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement
as counterparties to such Hedging Agreements being referred to in such capacity as the “Hedge
Counterparties”); (iii) the Trustee, on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
issued at such time (the “Original Senior Secured Noteholders”); (iv) certain intra-group creditors and debtors;
(v) certain direct or indirect shareholders of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in respect of certain structural debt
that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has incurred or may incur in the future (including any subordinated
shareholder loans); and (vi) certain further creditors that might accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with its terms from time to time.

Subsequent to entering into such document, a further issuance of senior secured notes was made by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer as contemplated by an offering memorandum dated April 24, 2014 and in accordance with
the terms thereof constituted a single class of debt securities with the then existing Senior Secured Notes held by
the Original Senior Secured Noteholders (the holders of all Existing Senior Secured Notes being together the
“Existing Senior Secured Noteholders”). As described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, the Additional
Senior Secured Notes to be issued as contemplated herein shall constitute a single class of debt securities with
the Existing Senior Secured Notes under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture and accordingly, subject
to compliance with the requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement, will be Senior Secured Notes, including for
the purposes of this description of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement with the holders of all Senior
Secured Notes being referred to in this description as the “Senior Secured Noteholders”.

In addition, as noted above, the Intercreditor Agreement contemplates the potential issuance of further debt
including provisions relating to future high yield notes, payment-in-kind notes or loans, exchange notes, debt
securities, loans or other debt instruments (“Future Senior Notes”) that may be incurred by CEL2 or any of its
holding companies which are not prohibited under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, any Pari Passu Debt Document (as defined below) or any other Senior Notes Indenture
(as defined below) to issue such Future Senior Notes, including Top Luxco, ranking with the priority set out
under “—Ranking and Priority” below. It is intended that the Senior Notes will, save as otherwise noted, fall
within these provisions, and accordingly, subject to compliance with the requirements of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the term “Senior Notes” as used in this description shall comprise the Senior Notes and any Future

Facility Documents”), (ii) the Hedging Agreements (the “Hedging Liabilities,” provided that, where such
Hedging Liabilities relate to the hedging of any interest rate exposure associated with the Revolving Credit

(v) the liabilities of the Senior Notes Issuer in respect of the Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities”),
(vi) the liabilities of the Debtors under guarantees (the “Senior Notes Guarantees”) in respect of the Senior
Notes (the “Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities”), and (vii) certain other unsecured liabilities will rank in right
and priority of payment in the following order:

- (in respect of liabilities owed by the Debtors (other than the Senior Notes Issuer) to the Primary Creditors
(as defined below): first, the Revolving Creditor Liabilities, the Priority Hedging Liabilities, the Non
Priority Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee Amounts (as defined below), the Pari Passu Debt Representative Amounts (as
defined below) and the Senior Notes Trustee Amounts (as defined below) pari passu and without any
preference between them; and second, the Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities pari passu between
themselves and without any preference between them; and

- (in respect of liabilities owed by the Senior Notes Issuer to the Primary Creditors): pari passu and without
any preference between each of the Revolving Creditor Liabilities, the Priority Hedging Liabilities, the Non
Priority Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities (including the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee Amounts), the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and the Senior Notes Liabilities (including the Senior
Notes Trustee Amounts).

The Transaction Security ranks and secures the following liabilities (but only to the extent that such Transaction
Security is expressed to secured those liabilities) in the following order:

- first, the liabilities owed to the Security Agent, the liabilities owed to the agent under the Revolving Credit
Facility (the “Revolving Agent”) (the “Revolving Agent Liabilities”), the liabilities owed to each trustee (a
“Senior Secured Notes Trustee”) in respect of Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes Trustee
Amounts”), the liabilities owed to each creditor representative (a “Pari Passu Debt Representative”) in

trustee or agent (a “Senior Notes Trustee”) in respect of Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes Trustee
Amounts”) pari passu and without any preference between them;

and that in any event (irrespective of the manner in which such Transaction Security is constituted) all proceeds
of the Transaction Security shall be applied as described under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

In this section:

-----

- any liabilities owed by any member of the Parent Group (and, while any Senior Notes issued by CEL2 or
Top Luxco of CEL2 are outstanding, CEL2 or Top Luxco) to Top Luxco, Luxco, CEL2, each Call Option
Grantor and each person who has become a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a subordinated creditor
(the “Subordinated Creditors”) under any loan (including, without limitation, certain proceeds loans) or any
Investment Instrument or which are indebtedness or which are declared dividends or any other distribution,
are referred to as (to the extent owed to any Subordinated Creditor) “Subordinated Liabilities.”

- any liabilities (excluding any Subordinated Liabilities) owed by any member of the Group to any other
member of the Group which is a creditor in respect of indebtedness of that first member of the Group and
which is or becomes a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an intra-group lender (the “Intra-Group
Lenders”), are referred to as “Intra-Group Liabilities.”

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral and certain other recoveries
will be applied as provided below under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that the Senior Notes Liabilities owed by the Senior Notes Issuer
are senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer but that the Senior Notes Creditors agree that, until the Secured
Debt Discharge Date (as defined below), they may not take any steps to appropriate the assets of the Senior
Notes Issuer that constitute Transaction Security in connection with any enforcement action, other than as
expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement (but this does not impair the right of the Senior Notes
Creditors to institute suit against a Senior Notes Issuer for the recovery of any payment due under the Senior
Notes).

**_Affected liabilities and soulte_**

Notwithstanding the above, the expressions “Hedging Liabilities”, “Priority Hedging Liabilities”, “Revolving
Creditor Liabilities”, “Senior Notes Liabilities”, “Senior Secured Liabilities” and “Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities” shall also encompass (a) such liabilities which have become Affected Liabilities from time to time
and (b) the amount of any Soulte (as defined below) (if any) owed but not yet paid by the relevant creditors of
such liabilities and the amount of any Soulte (if any) effectively paid by such creditors but only to the extent not
funded (at the time of such payment) out of Cash Proceeds (as defined below) allocated in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or not repaid by the payee pursuant to a clawback.

For these purposes:

“Affected Liabilities” means in respect of any relevant Liabilities, (a) those Liabilities which have been
extinguished or discharged in connection with a Foreclosure (as defined below) (other than by payment in cash),
(b) those Liabilities which have been released, waived or reduced (including under an abandon de créance or
_remise de dette) at any time following the Foreclosure Date (as defined below), (c) those liabilities which have_
been converted into Investment Instruments, in each case at any time following a Foreclosure, (d) the amount of
the Soulte (if any) effectively paid by the Creditors (as defined below) of those liabilities (or any representative
thereof) in connection with a Foreclosure but only to the extent (i) not funded (at the time of such payment) out
of Cash Proceeds allocated in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) not repaid by the relevant
payee pursuant to a clawback; and (e) in respect of Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities and/or
Senior Notes Liabilities, the relevant Replacement Cost and Shareholding Cost (each as defined below) which
have accrued for more than a year.

“Cash Proceeds” means (a) all amounts or distributions received in cash by the Foreclosed Assets Holders (as
defined below) in respect of certain Collateral foreclosed on by the Secured Parties (as defined below)
(“Foreclosed Assets”) or Investment Instruments issued by a Secured Parties SPV (as defined below) (including
in connection with a liquidation or a winding-up of a Secured Parties SPV) and (b) all proceeds received in cash
by Foreclosed Assets Holders as a result of an Exit Disposal (as defined below), in each case before deducting
any liabilities for taxes incurred and required to be paid by Foreclosed Assets Holders in connection with those
distributions but, in the case of either a sale of Foreclosed Assets by a Secured Parties SPV or a sale of shares in
any entity which is a subsidiary of any Debtor whose Investment Instruments are the object of a Foreclosure or
the Secured Parties SPV, after deducting any taxes payable by the seller.

“Soulte” means, in relation to any enforcement action occurring by way of Foreclosure, the amount by which
the value of the Collateral so appropriated or foreclosed as a result of such Foreclosure (as determined in
accordance with the relevant Transaction Security Document) exceeds the amount of the secured obligations
secured under the corresponding Transaction Security Document immediately prior to such Foreclosure

occurring (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Assigned Recourse Rights (as defined
below) arising from or in connection with such Foreclosure).

**_New money and refinancing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement contemplates that, to the extent permitted by, and subject to compliance with the
requirements of, the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents:

- the Revolving Lenders may increase a Revolving Credit Facility and make further advances under such
Revolving Credit Facility to members of the Group and each such advance or increased amount will be
deemed to be made under the terms of the relevant Revolving Credit Facility;

- a Senior Secured Notes Issuer may issue Senior Secured Notes in addition to the Senior Secured Notes
issued at the time of entering into the Intercreditor Agreement (whether under the Existing Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or an additional Senior Secured Notes Indenture);

- a Debtor may incur Pari Passu Debt under a Pari Passu Debt Document;

- the Senior Notes Issuer may issue Senior Notes or incur Senior Notes Liabilities under a Senior Notes
Finance Document; and

- any of the above liabilities may with the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer be refinanced or
replaced in whole or in part,

and that any such additional, increased or refinanced liabilities shall rank and be secured under the Intercreditor
Agreement on a super senior basis, senior secured basis or (as applicable) senior basis as provided for under the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors in respect of Revolving Creditor Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities,
Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and Senior Notes Liabilities (together the “Secured Parties”) agree that if any
Transaction Security over any asset under the applicable Transaction Security Documents is amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or released to ensure that the additional,
increased or refinanced liabilities described above (the “Additional Secured Liabilities”) can be secured with the
ranking contemplated as set out under “—Ranking and Priority” above, then the Security Agent is authorized to
effect such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release the
applicable Transaction Security Documents provided that:

- if an event of default under a Revolving Credit Facility (that is not to be refinanced or replaced in whole) is
continuing at that time the requisite consent under the Revolving Credit Facility is obtained;

- immediately upon such release of Transaction Security, new Transaction Security shall be provided in favor
of the providers of such Additional Secured Liabilities and the existing Secured Creditors (as defined
below) on terms substantially the same as the terms of the Transaction Security Documents released and
subject to the same ranking as set out under “—Ranking and Priority” above; and

- contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification,
renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of Security of at least equivalent ranking over the
same assets), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer delivers to the Security Agent either (A) a solvency opinion
from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Security Agent confirming the solvency of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, CEL2,
Luxco or Top Luxco (as applicable) and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement or release and retaking; (B) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of
the relevant person, which certificate confirms the solvency of the person granting such Transaction
Security after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement or release and retaking; or (C) an opinion of counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent (subject to customary exceptions and
qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the
Transaction Security created under the Transaction Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken is valid and perfected Transaction

153


-----

Security not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law,
that such Transaction Security was not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement, no Secured Party shall be required to
release any Transaction Security under the Transaction Security Documents where the release described above
may result in such Secured Party incurring any hardening period risk in respect of any such Transaction Security
if and to the extent that the relevant Additional Secured Liabilities can be secured by lower ranking Security in
favor of the Secured Parties with the ranking described under “—Ranking and Priority” above by virtue of the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Permitted payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits, inter alia, payments to be made by the Debtors or relevant issuer under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Hedging Agreements, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Pari Passu Debt
Documents and the Senior Notes Indenture, in each case in accordance with the terms of the document creating
or evidencing such liabilities, but subject to: (i) in the case of payments in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
and Pari Passu Debt, compliance with certain conditions related to a Notes Repurchase (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) pursuant to which prepayments may not be made if the ratio of
Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA (each, as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) would exceed the ratio which is 10% below the specified ratio in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement for the relevant period or any default is continuing or would occur as a result of the Notes
Repurchase unless such prepayment is funded with the cash proceeds of a subscription for shares of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or a capital contribution to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; (ii) in the case of payments in
respect of Hedging Liabilities, the conditions described under “—Permitted Hedging Liabilities Payments”
below; and (iii) in the case of payments in respect of the Senior Notes and Additional Senior Liabilities, the
conditions described under “—Permitted Senior Notes Payments” below.

After the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined below) no member of the Group may make a payment
in respect of Revolving Creditor Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or Pari Passu Debt Liabilities
except from recoveries distributed in accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of
_Proceeds” below. No payment may be made by a Debtor in respect of Hedging Liabilities after an Acceleration_
Event has occurred except from recoveries distributed in accordance with the payment waterfall described in
“—Application of Proceeds” below.

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments to be made from time to time to Intra-Group Lenders owed
any Intra-Group Liabilities (“Intra-Group Liabilities Payments”) if at the time of payment no acceleration event
has occurred in respect of the Revolving Creditor Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu
Debt Liabilities or the Senior Notes Liabilities (an “Acceleration Event”). The Intercreditor Agreement permits
Intra-Group Liabilities Payments if an Acceleration Event has occurred: (i) prior to the date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities and Senior Notes Liabilities are discharged in cash (the “Final
Discharge Date”), with the consent of (1) the requisite majority of Revolving Lenders (the “Majority Revolving
Lenders”), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) or (2) (if, at that time,
the Security Agent is obliged to give effect to instructions from the requisite majority of Senior Noteholders (the
“Majority Senior Notes Creditors”) as to the manner of enforcement of the Transaction Security as described
under “—Manner of Enforcement of Transaction Security” below, the Majority Senior Notes Creditors; (ii) after
the discharge date (the “Secured Debt Discharge Date”) in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities and Senior
Secured Liabilities (together the “Secured Debt”) but prior to the discharge date in respect of the Senior Notes
Liabilities (the “Senior Notes Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Majority Senior Notes Creditors; (iii) if
that payment is made by a Debtor which is not a member of the Parent Group to an Intra-Group Lender which is
not a member of the Parent Group; or (iv) if that payment is made solely to facilitate payment of the Super
Senior Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Trustee
Amounts, Senior Notes Trustee Amounts or (to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement to be paid)
Senior Notes Liabilities..

Payments may be made in respect of Subordinated Liabilities if: (i) the payment is not prohibited by the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and
the Senior Notes Indenture, in each case prior to the relevant discharge date; (ii) prior to the Secured Debt
Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s)
and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) consent to such payment being made; or (iii) on or after the Secured
Debt Discharge Date, the prior consent of the relevant Senior Notes Trustee is obtained.

make payments to any Hedge Counterparty in respect of the Hedging Liabilities then due to that Hedge
Counterparty under any Hedging Agreement in accordance with the terms of that Hedging Agreement: (i) if the
payment is a scheduled payment arising under the relevant Hedging Agreement; (ii) to the extent that the
relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a result of the operation of certain provisions relating
to non- credit related close-outs under the Hedging Agreements including, inter alia, in relation to withholding
tax, payments in the contractual currency, judgments and expenses; (iii) to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s
obligation to make the payment arises as a result of the operation of a credit related close-out or a permitted
automatic early termination under the Hedging Agreement which arises as a result of an event relating to a
Debtor and where no event of default under any Debt Document is continuing at the time of, or would result
from, that payment; (iv) where the relevant payment relates to a close-out or termination arising as a result of a
bankruptcy event of default or force majeure termination event with respect to the relevant Hedge Counterparty
and where no default under any Debt Document is continuing at the time of, or would result from, that payment;
(v) with the consent of the Majority Revolving Lenders and Majority Senior Secured Creditors or (vi) to the
extent necessary to comply with the maximum Priority Hedging requirements in the Intercreditor Agreement.

(a) prior to the Secured Debt Discharge Date, make payments to the Senior Notes Creditors in
respect of the Senior Notes Liabilities then due in accordance with the Senior Notes Finance Documents:

(1) a refinancing in full (by way of the issue of new Senior
Notes by the Senior Notes Issuer) of the proceeds of any existing Senior
Notes which have not been contributed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

(2) a percentage of each payment referred to in (I) and
(II) above in respect of the Relevant Senior Notes Liabilities which is the
same percentage as the percentage of the proceeds of the Senior Notes

Senior Secured Discharge Date has not occurred) and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) (if the relevant Pari
Passu Debt Discharge Date has not occurred) and subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement which
deal with the effects of an insolvency event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not make (and shall procure
that its Subsidiaries shall not make), and no Senior Notes Creditor may receive from the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, any payment in respect of the Senior Notes which would otherwise be
permitted as referred to above (a “Permitted Senior Note Payment”) (other than any referred to in (a)(ii) of “—
_Permitted Senior Notes Payments” above and any Senior Notes Trustee Amounts) if:_

(i) a Secured Debt Payment Default is continuing; or

-----

continuing, from the date which is one Business Day (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) after the date on which the Revolving Agent, any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or any Pari
Passu Debt Representative (as the case may be) delivers a notice (a “Senior Notes Payment Stop
Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Secured Debt Event of Default to the
Senior Notes Issuer, the Security Agent, the Revolving Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s), the
Senior Notes Trustee(s) and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) (in each case, as applicable) until the
earliest of:

(A) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Notes Payment Stop
Notice;

(B) in relation to payments of Senior Notes Liabilities, if a Senior Note
Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of that Senior Notes
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Senior Note Standstill Period expires;

(C) the date on which the relevant Secured Debt Event of Default has been
remedied or waived or, if the relevant Revolving Creditor Liabilities or Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities have been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded, in accordance with the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the relevant Senior Secured Finance Documents or
Pari Passu Debt Finance Document (as applicable);

(D) the date on which each Revolving Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s)
and Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) which delivered the relevant Senior Notes Payment
Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Senior Notes Issuer, the Security Agent, the Revolving
Agent(s), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s), the Senior Note Representatives(s) and the Pari
Passu Debt Representative(s) (in each case, as applicable) cancelling the Senior Notes
Payment Stop Notice;

(E) the Secured Debt Discharge Date; and

enforcement action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a member of the
Group.

(b) Unless the Senior Notes Trustee(s) waive this requirement:

360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice;
and

(ii) no Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Secured
Debt Event of Default more than 45 days after the date the Revolving Agent, each Senior Secured
Notes Trustee and each Pari Passu Debt Representative received notice of that Secured Debt Event of
Default.

(c) The Revolving Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) may only serve one Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances. Subject as described in paragraph (b) above, this shall not affect the right of the Revolving Agent
or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) or the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) to issue a Senior Notes Payment
Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

(d) No Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Revolving Agent, a Senior Secured

notified to the Revolving Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s),
as relevant, at the time at which an earlier Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice was issued.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to a Senior
Notes Payment Stop Notice:

(i) act as a suspension of payment and not as a waiver of the right to receive payment on
the date such payments are due;

157


-----

(ii) will not prevent the accrual or capitalization of interest (including default interest) in
accordance with the Senior Notes Finance Documents;

(iii) will not prevent the payment of any Senior Notes Trustee Amounts and of certain
administrative costs; and

(iv) will not prevent the payment of audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and other proper and

**_Cure of payment stop: Senior Notes Creditors_**

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Secured Debt Payment Default, that Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the
case may be) the Secured Debt Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Notes Creditors an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under the Senior Notes Finance Documents and which would have been Permitted
Senior Notes Payments but for that Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice or Secured Debt Payment Default,

then any event of default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived
and any Senior Notes Enforcement Notice (as defined below) which may have been issued as a result of that
event of default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior
Notes Creditors.

**_Restrictions on enforcement by senior notes finance parties_**

Until the Secured Debt Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group
(as defined below):

applicable), require the enforcement of, any Transaction Security Documents; and

(b) no Senior Noteholder shall take or require the taking of any enforcement action in relation to
the Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities or, in the case of Senior Notes which are not issued by Top Luxco or a
holding company of Top Luxco, the Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities and/or the Senior Notes Issuer

respect of (i) the Senior Notes Liabilities or (ii) the security granted in favor of the Security Agent under the
Transaction Security Documents over Investment Instruments issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to
CEL2 or (if the Senior Notes Issuer is a holding company of CEL2) over any Investment Instruments issued by

(a) an event of default (a “Senior Notes Event of Default”) under the Senior Notes is continuing
(the “Relevant Senior Notes Default”);

Representative(s) have received a written notice of the Relevant Senior Notes Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Notes Default from the relevant Senior Notes Trustee;

(c) a Senior Notes Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

158


-----

(d) the Relevant Senior Notes Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Notes
Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Notes Event of Default, the relevant Senior Notes Trustee(s) may by
notice (a “Senior Notes Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Revolving Agent, each Senior Secured Notes
Trustee and each Pari Passu Debt Representative of the existence of such Senior Notes Event of Default.

**_Senior notes standstill period_**

In relation to a Relevant Senior Notes Default, a Senior Notes Standstill Period shall mean the period beginning
on the date (the “Senior Notes Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Notes Trustee(s) serves a Senior Notes
Enforcement Notice on the Revolving Agent, each Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each Pari Passu Debt
Representative in respect of such Relevant Senior Notes Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Notes Standstill Start Date (the “Senior Notes
Standstill Period”);

(b) the date the Secured Creditors take any enforcement action in relation to a particular member
of the Group that is a guarantor of the Senior Notes (a “Senior Notes Guarantor”) or as, applicable, the Senior
Notes Issuer if it is not Top Luxco or a holding company of Top Luxco, provided, however, that:

(i) if a Senior Notes Standstill Period ends as described in this section, the Senior Notes
Creditors may only take the same enforcement action in relation to the Senior Notes Guarantor as the
enforcement action taken by the Secured Creditors against such Senior Notes Guarantor and not against
any other member of the Group; and

(ii) enforcement action for these purposes does not include action taken to preserve or
protect any Security as opposed to realize it;

(c) the date of an insolvency event (other than as a result of any action taken by any Senior Notes
Creditor) in relation to a particular Senior Notes Guarantor or, as applicable, the Senior Notes Issuer if it is not

Debt Representative give their consent to the termination of the relevant Senior Notes Standstill Period; and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding on the Senior Notes at the final stated
maturity of the Senior Notes.

The Senior Notes Finance Parties may take enforcement action as described under “—Permitted Senior Notes
_Guarantee and Senior Notes Security Documents Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior Notes_
Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Notes Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior
Notes Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Notes Event of Default.

**_Enforcement on behalf of senior notes finance parties_**

(a) If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Notes Trustee(s) that it is taking steps to enforce
Transaction Security created pursuant to any Transaction Security Document over shares of a Senior Notes
Guarantor, no Senior Notes Finance Party may take any action described under “—Permitted Senior Notes
_Guarantee and Senior Notes Security Documents Enforcement” above against that Senior Notes Guarantor_
while the Security Agent (i) has requested instructions of an Instructing Group in relation to the enforcement of
that Security and the relevant instructions have not been given or (ii) is taking steps to enforce that Security in
accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to
adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

(b) If the Senior Notes Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to require
the enforcement of the Transaction Security constituted pursuant to any Transaction Security Document in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement described under this section, such enforcement

159


-----

action must require the realization of the relevant Security by way of a sale or disposal conducted in compliance
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement described under “—Conditions to release—Senior Notes
_protection” below._

**_Manner of enforcement of transaction security_**

(a) The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security or taking any other
enforcement action unless instructed otherwise by either the requisite majority (the “Majority Super Senior
Creditors”) of Revolving Creditors and Hedge Counterparties in respect of Priority Hedging (the “Super Senior
Creditors”) or the requisite majority (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) of Senior Secured Notes
Creditors, Pari Passu Creditors and Hedge Counterparties in respect of Non Priority Hedging (the “Senior
Secured Creditors” and together with the Super Senior Creditors, the “Secured Creditors”) whichever at the
relevant time is entitled to give instructions in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement as
described below (each an “Instructing Group” provided that, if such enforcement is on or after the Secured Debt
Discharge Date but before the Senior Notes Discharge Date, the Instructing Group shall for these purposes be
the Majority Senior Notes Creditors).

(b) Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms:

(i) subject to the consultation requirements described below, an Instructing Group may
give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security as they see fit provided that the instructions as to Enforcement given by the
Instructing Group are consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles (as defined below); or

(ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the Senior Notes
Shared Security prior to the Senior Notes Discharge Date as described under “—Permitted Senior
_Notes Guarantee and Senior Notes Security Documents Enforcement” above and except as provided_
below, the Senior Notes Trustee(s) (acting on the instruction of the Majority Senior Notes Creditors)
may give instructions to the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Senior Notes Shared Security
as they see fit.

(c) Prior to the Secured Debt Discharge Date:

(i) if the Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease
enforcing the Transaction Security; or

(ii) in the absence of instructions from the Instructing Group,

and, in each case, the Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below), the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Senior Notes Shared Security
which the Senior Notes Trustee(s) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Senior Notes Creditors) are then
entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under “—Permitted Senior Notes Guarantee and Senior
_Notes Security Documents Enforcement.”_

(d) Notwithstanding the above, if at any time the Senior Notes Trustee(s) are then entitled to give
the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Senior Notes Shared Security pursuant to paragraph (c) above and
the Senior Notes Trustee(s) either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to give such instruction, then:

(i) the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Senior Notes Shared Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce
given by the Senior Notes Trustee(s) as described under “—Permitted Senior Notes Guarantee and
_Senior Notes Security Documents Enforcement” above; and_

(ii) if the Instructing Group gives any instructions to enforce any Transaction Security
over shares in a Holding Company of any member of the Parent Group whose shares are subject to
Transaction Security with respect to which any such enforcement instructions by a Senior Note(s)
Trustee have been given, the Security Agent may not act on such enforcement instructions from any
Senior Notes Trustee(s) unless instructed to do so by the Instructing Group.

(e) No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to any
Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Transaction Security Documents
except through the Security Agent.

160


-----

If the Transaction Security is being enforced as described above, the Security Agent shall enforce the
Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator of any
Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as an Instructing Group (or, in the relevant circumstances
described above, the Senior Notes Trustee(s)) shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the
Security Agent sees fit, in each case, so far as is consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles.

**_Consultation with respect to enforcement of transaction security_**

(a) Prior to the Final Discharge Date and subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
described under (c) below, before the giving of any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction
Security as described under “—Manner of Enforcement of Transaction Security” above (and before either the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors shall be considered the Instructing
Group), a Revolving Agent or representative for each of the Senior Secured Creditors shall deliver a copy of its
proposed enforcement instructions to the other representatives and the Security Agent at least ten Business Days
(or such shorter period as each representative shall agree) prior to the proposed date for the issuance of such
instructions as set out therein (the “Proposed Enforcement Instruction Date”).

(b) If the Security Agent, prior to the Proposed Enforcement Instruction Date, receives conflicting
enforcement instructions from another representative (including the failure of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors to give instructions, which, for the sole purpose of triggering a
consultation period as described under this “—Consultation with respect to enforcement of Transaction
_Security,” will be deemed to be conflicting enforcement instructions), then the representatives for each of the_
Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors shall be notified of such conflicting enforcement
instructions by the Security Agent and must consult with each other and the Security Agent in good faith for a
period of up to 30 days (or such shorter period as the they may agree) from the date of receipt of the latest of
such instructions, with a view to co-ordinating the enforcement instructions (the “Consultation Period”). In the
event that no conflicting enforcement instructions are received prior to the Proposed Enforcement Instruction
Date, the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received by it on the Proposed
Enforcement Instruction Date.

(c) Following the Consultation Period, if the relevant representatives are able to agree the manner
in which enforcement action shall be implemented, they shall give joint instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce the Transaction Security as described under “—Manner of Enforcement of Transaction Security” above.
If such representatives have not been able to agree on an enforcement strategy by the end of the Consultation
Period, the Security Agent shall, subject to (d) and (g) below, follow instructions as to how enforce or to refrain
from enforcing the Transaction Security given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (if it is so instructed).

(d) If a representative for the Senior Secured Noteholders or Pari Passu Creditors is unable to give
instructions as to how to enforce or to refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security as described under
(c) above, the Security Agent shall follow the instructions of a Revolving Agent.

(e) A representative acting on behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors, as the case may be, may at any time provide immediate enforcement instructions to
the Security Agent and shall not be obliged to consult (as described above):

(i) if the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of the occurrence of
any insolvency event in relation to a member of the Group; or

(ii) if a Revolving Agent or representative for the Senior Secured Creditors determines in
good faith that to do so and thereby delay enforcement could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on (A) its ability to enforce the Transaction Security or (B) the proceeds of realization of
the Transaction Security.

(f) Prior to the Final Discharge Date and except as described under (g) below, if the Security
Agent receives conflicting enforcement instructions from a Revolving Agent and a representative acting on
behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, as the case may be, then
_provided that the instructions from the representative acting on behalf of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors_
comply with the consultation requirements described above and with the Security Enforcement Principles, the
Security Agent shall comply with the enforcement instructions received from the representative of the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors.

161


-----

(g) In the event that:

(i) the Revolving Lenders have not been fully repaid within six months of the relevant
Proposed Enforcement Instruction Date; or

(ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action within three months
of the relevant Proposed Enforcement Instruction Date,

then the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors shall prevail (with effect from the date of the
earliest to occur of such events).

(h) If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (in each case
acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in a manner which is
not consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles, subject to (e) and (f) above, the representative(s) for the
Super Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate) shall give notice to the representative(s)
for the other Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate) after which the
representative(s) for the other Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate) shall consult
with the Security Agent for a period of 10 days (or such lesser period as the relevant representatives may agree)
with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement provided that such representatives shall not be obliged to
consult as described in this paragraph (h) more than once in relation to each enforcement action.

**_Limitation on enforcement of subordinated liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement action in
respect of such liabilities prior to the Final Discharge Date (other than certain specific enforcement action
relating to payment of the Subordinated Liabilities which at the time of such enforcement action would be
permitted as described under “—Permitted Payments” above unless, at such time, the Secured Parties and
Senior Notes Creditors (the “Primary Creditors”) are or the Security Agent is taking any enforcement action
required by the Instructing Group or following an Acceleration Event) save that, after the occurrence of an
insolvency event in relation to a member of the Parent Group (or, while Senior Notes issued by CEL2 or a
holding company of CEL2 are outstanding, in relation to CEL2 or that holding company) each such Creditor
may only (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given
notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Creditor in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement), exercise any right it may otherwise have against that member of the Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that member of the Group’s Subordinated Liabilities or declare them
prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that
member of the Group in respect of any Subordinated Liabilities;

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any Subordinated

Creditors in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement action in respect
of such liabilities prior to the Final Discharge Date (other than certain specific enforcement action as set out in
the Intercreditor Agreement) save that, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of
the Group, each Intra-Group Lender may (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security
Agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Intra-Group Lender in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) and shall, if so directed by the Security Agent, exercise any right
it may otherwise have against that member of the Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that member of the Group’s Intra-Group Liabilities or declare them
prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that
member of the Group in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities;

162


-----

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any Intra-Group
Liabilities of that member of the Group; or

(d) file claims, or claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the
Intra-Group Liabilities owing to it.

**_Security enforcement principles_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for enforcement instructions in relation to the Transaction Security to be
consistent with the following security enforcement principles (the “Security Enforcement Principles”):

(a) it shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to
achieve the objective of maximizing the recovery of the Secured Parties, to the extent consistent with (i) a
prompt and expeditious enforcement of the Transaction Security (to the extent reasonably possible) and (ii) the
rights and obligations of the Security Agent under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and under applicable
law (the “Security Enforcement Objective”);

(b) the Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written
consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

(c) except in the case of a Foreclosure, the Transaction Security will be enforced and other action
as to enforcement will be taken such that either:

(i) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for
distribution in accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of Proceeds” below;
or

(ii) sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash
to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with in accordance with the payment
waterfall described in “—Application of Proceeds” below, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and
discharged in full (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise);

(d) any Exit Disposal (as defined below) may only be effected upon the instructions of an
Instructing Group and in accordance with these Security Enforcement Principles as if such Exit Disposal was an
enforcement of Transaction Security;

(e) the enforcement action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to
the other provisions of this Agreement, the timeframe for the realization of value from the enforcement of the
Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal or Exit Disposal pursuant to enforcement will be determined by the
Instructing Group provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective;

(f) on (i) a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares
in a member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds a specified amount (or its
equivalent in other currencies) or (ii) a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or
all of the shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent shall if
requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, and at the expense
of the Parent, (to the extent that financial advisers have not adopted a general policy of not providing such
opinions) appoint a financial adviser (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine:

(i) that the consideration received for any disposal is fair from a financial point of view
taking into account all relevant circumstances;

(ii) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the
Security Enforcement Principles and maximize the recovery of any such enforcement action; and

(iii) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective,

(the “Financial Adviser’s Opinion”) provided that, if the Security Agent is unable to
obtain an opinion from a Financial Adviser covering the matters set out under (ii) and
(iii) above (and after considering making such modifications to the enforcement
process as may be reasonably available and consistent with the Security Enforcement
Principles to obtain such opinion), then an opinion covering (i) above shall be

163


-----

sufficient to constitute a Financial Adviser’s Opinion for the purposes of the Security
Enforcement Principles;

(g) the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Adviser or to seek the
advice of a Financial Adviser, unless expressly required to do so by these Security Enforcement Principles or
any other provision of this Agreement. Prior to making any appointment of a Financial Advisor, the Security
Agent is entitled to ensure that cost cover (at a level it is satisfied with acting reasonably) has been provided;

(h) the Financial Adviser’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in
relation to any other enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of
view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security
Enforcement Objective has been met;

(i) in the absence of written notice from a creditor or group of creditors that are not part of the
relevant Instructing Group that such creditor(s) object to any enforcement of the Transaction Security on the
grounds that such enforcement action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective, the Security
Agent is entitled to assume that such enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security
Enforcement Objective;

(j) if the Security Agent is unable to obtain a Financial Adviser’s Opinion after attempting to do
so (and after considering making such modifications to the enforcement process as may be reasonably available
and consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles to obtain such opinion) because such opinions are not
generally available in the market in such circumstances it shall notify the Revolving Agent and each
representative in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or Pari Passu Debt and may proceed to enforce
the Transaction Security without needing to demonstrate (by way of a Financial Adviser’s Opinion or otherwise)
that such enforcement is aiming to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective; and

(k) if enforcement of any Transaction Security is conducted by way of a public auction or other
competitive sales process specified in the Intercreditor Agreement, no Financial Adviser shall be required to be
appointed, and no Financial Adviser’s Opinion shall be required, in relation to such enforcement provided that
the Security Agent shall be entitled (but not obliged) to appoint a Financial Adviser to provide such advice as
the Security Agent deems appropriate in relation to such enforcement by way of public auction or other
competitive sale process in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Exercise of voting rights_**

After the occurrence of an insolvency event in respect of any Debtor, prior to the Final Discharge Date, each
creditor of Subordinated Liabilities and Intra-Group Liabilities (each a “Subordinated Party”) irrevocably
authorizes the Security Agent to exercise, to the extent permitted by law, all powers of convening meetings,
voting and representation in relation to that Subordinated Party in respect of the Intra Group Liabilities and the
Subordinated Liabilities and each relevant Subordinated Party will provide all forms of proxy and representation
requested by the Security Agent for such purpose. In particular, following the occurrence of any judicial
reorganization, safeguard or similar process in relation to any member of the Group, each Creditor and each
Subordinated Creditor agrees that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote of that Creditor or
Subordinated Creditor in such capacity by or under the supervision of any judicial or supervisory authority in
respect of any such proceeding, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, as instructed by that Security Agent
(acting as directed by the relevant Instructing Group) and in any event in a manner which is consistent with the
principles set forth and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

judicial foreclosure in favor of, or attribution to, Secured Parties (or any representative on their behalf) or a
Secured Parties SPV or (b) a disposal to a Secured Parties SPV (including a disposal made in the context of the

Transaction Security Documents.

“Foreclosure Date” means the first date on which a Foreclosure occurs.

“Secured Parties SPV” means a special purpose limited liability vehicle acquiring or holding Investment

such Soulte shall be payable:

(a) only by the relevant Creditors having participated in the relevant Foreclosure (pro rata to the
amount of Liabilities which have been discharged as a result of such Foreclosure);

(b) only on the earlier of:

(i) the date which is 10 days after the Final Discharge Date; and

(ii) the date falling 18 months or, in connection with Foreclosure of any Transaction

The Security Agent may require all Secured Creditors to participate in the Foreclosure of any Senior Notes
Shared Security, provided that any Soulte in connection with such Foreclosure shall only be payable by
(i) Super Senior Creditors if the Majority Super Senior Creditors constitute the Instructing Group requesting

Group requesting such Foreclosure.

In case several different classes of Secured Creditors participate in a Foreclosure in respect of any Senior Notes
Shares Security, and if the relevant Collateral under Senior Notes Shared Security may not be held on trust by
the Security Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, such Collateral under Senior Notes Shared Security
shall be attributed (on the basis of the value determined in accordance with the relevant Transaction Security
Document) first to the Super Senior Creditors, then to the Senior Secured Creditors and then to the Senior Notes
Creditors, in each case, on a pari passu basis and accordance with the waterfall provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement as if such Collateral under Senior Notes Shared Security had been cash.

**_Senior notes call option_**

The Senior Notes Call Option (as defined below) may not be exercised with respect to any Senior Notes
Liabilities in respect of which the only Senior Notes Issuer is Top Luxco or any of its holding companies.
Accordingly, the provisions in this section shall not apply to the issuance of Senior Notes contemplated by this
Offering Memorandum.

The Security Agent may after the occurrence of an enforcement action referred to in sub-paragraph (i) below

it being acknowledged by each Senior Notes Creditor that the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of any exercise of
the Senior Notes Call Option vis-à-vis any other Senior Notes Creditors shall have no effect whatsoever on its
rights and obligations under the relevant provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The assignment of the Senior Notes Liabilities to the Security Agent (or to a nominee or nominees) pursuant to
the Senior Notes Call Option shall occur without any formality and be deemed to occur on the date upon which
the Senior Notes Trustee receives the Senior Notes Call Option Exercise Notice (the “Senior Notes Liabilities
Assignment Date”), and is made by each Senior Notes Creditor unilaterally, irrevocably and unconditionally
free and clear from any Security and without any formality.

The aggregate consideration (the “Senior Notes Liabilities Deferred Consideration”) for the assignment of the
Senior Notes Liabilities under the Senior Notes Call Option shall be equal to the amount of the Senior Notes
Liabilities (and Replacement Cost thereon, as the case may be) from time to time (as reduced in accordance with
paragraph “—Senior Notes Only Charged Property Call Option” below as the case may be) but shall be payable
only to the extent and when there are enough proceeds to be applied by the Security Agent to pay such Senior
Notes Liabilities Deferred Consideration in accordance with the order of priority and the waterfall provisions
described under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

The Senior Notes Liabilities which are subject to the Senior Notes Call Option may be assigned and/or
transferred by the Security Agent in the context of an Exit Disposal or to facilitate such Exit Disposal.

Following the Senior Notes Liabilities Assignment Date, the Senior Notes Trustee shall act solely upon the
instructions of the Security Agent in relation to any matter in respect of the Senior Notes Liabilities other than in
respect of Senior Notes Only Charged Property in respect of which the Senior Notes Only Call Option has been
exercised in accordance with the description under “—Senior Notes Only Charged Property Call Option”
below).

After the Senior Notes Liabilities Assignment Date, the Senior Notes Sellers (as defined below) shall remain
entitled to receive all financial statements to be provided by members of the Group to the Senior Notes Trustee
in the relevant Senior Notes Indenture (as currently in force as at the date the Senior Notes Call Option is
exercised) as if they were still Senior Noteholders.

On and from the Senior Notes Liabilities Assignment Date (or the date of any release or transfer of Senior Notes
Liabilities pursuant to paragraph “—Distressed Disposal” below) in connection with a Foreclosure) to the date
falling 179 days thereafter (and provided that, at such time, no Exit Disposal has been completed or
commenced) the Senior Notes Sellers Agent (as defined below) may request the Security Agent to appoint, at
the cost of the Senior Notes Sellers Agent, a Financial Adviser to provide a valuation (including an enterprise
valuation of the members of the Group forming part of the assets which are subject of the Senior Notes Shared
Security) in relation to the immediate recovery value of the Senior Notes Liabilities assuming an immediate sale
for cash of the Collateral under the Senior Notes Shared Security and taking into consideration the waterfall
provisions described under “—Application of Proceeds” below (the “Senior Notes Recovery Value”). Such
valuation shall promptly be notified by the Financial Adviser to the Security Agent and the Senior Notes Sellers
Agent. Within two months of such notification, and if such valuation demonstrates that the Senior Notes
Recovery Value exceeds the value of all the payments and distributions that would be required under the first
eight paragraphs of the payment waterfall described under “—Application of Proceeds” below, the Senior Notes
Sellers Agent shall have the right to request the Security Agent promptly to commence an Exit Disposal in
respect of the Collateral under the Senior Notes Shared Security which shall be conducted in compliance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement described under “—Conditions to release—Senior Notes
_protection” below. There shall be no obligation to complete such Exit Disposal unless all the payments and_
distributions referred to in the first eight paragraphs of the payment waterfall described under “—Application of
_Proceeds” below will be made in cash and in full upon such Exit Disposal being completed._

**_Senior notes only charged property call option_**

The provisions in this section shall not apply to the issuance of Senior Notes contemplated by this Offering
Memorandum as they will not benefit from any Senior Notes Only Charged Property (as defined below).

Following the Senior Notes Liabilities Assignment Date and for a period of 2 months thereafter, the Senior
Notes Sellers Agent may request the Security Agent to appoint a Financial Adviser to provide a valuation (the
“Senior Notes Only Charged Property Value”) of the assets (the “Senior Notes Only Charged Property”) which

166


-----

are subject to the Security granted for the Senior Notes Liabilities over assets of CEL2 which (a) are not subject
to Transaction Security and (b) are not shares in, or liabilities owed by, the Parent or any of its subsidiaries (the
“Senior Notes Only Security”).

Upon notice (the “Senior Notes Only Call Option Exercise Notice”) from the Senior Notes Sellers Agent to the
Senior Notes Issuer and to the Security Agent, the Senior Notes Issuer shall assign unilaterally, irrevocably and
unconditionally the Senior Notes Only Charged Property to the Senior Notes Sellers Agent or a nominee on its
behalf (the “Senior Notes Only Call Option”).

The Senior Notes Sellers Agent shall only be entitled to exercise the Senior Notes Only Call Option for a period
of three months following receipt by it of the notice setting forth the Senior Notes Only Charged Property
Value.

The aggregate consideration (the “Senior Notes Only Charged Property Deferred Consideration”) payable to the
Senior Notes Issuer for the assignment of the Senior Notes Only Charged Property pursuant to the Senior Notes
Only Charged Property Call Option shall be equal to the Senior Notes Only Charged Property Value and shall
be applied as follows:

(i) first, immediately (and, to the extent possible, on a cashless basis), by way of set-off against
the Senior Notes Liabilities (whether or not such Senior Notes Liabilities are then due and payable) and on the
basis that for this purpose the Senior Notes Liabilities will be ascribed the value they would have had without
regard to any amendment or waiver thereof since the Senior Notes Liabilities Assignment Date and on the
assumption that interest (x) accrued on the Senior Notes Liabilities since the Senior Notes Liabilities
Assignment Date at the highest contractual rate applicable to the Senior Notes Liabilities as at the Senior Notes
Liabilities Assignment Date and (y) was capitalized on any interest payment date(s) that fell since the Senior
Notes Liabilities Assignment Date); and

(ii) second, the balance (if any) in cash to the Senior Notes Issuer on the date which is ten
Business Days after the date on which the Senior Notes Sellers Agent (or its nominee) has sold or otherwise
disposed of the Senior Notes Only Charged Property substantially for cash, provided that the balance payable
under this sub-paragraph (ii) shall be reduced by the amount (if any) by which the proceeds of such sale or
disposal (net of any costs, expenses and taxes in connection therewith) are less than the Senior Notes Only
Charged Property Deferred Consideration.

The Senior Notes Issuer may only assign the Senior Notes Only Charged Property pursuant to the Senior Notes
Only Call Option if the Security Agent is reasonably satisfied on the Senior Notes Only Assignment Date that
(x) the set off contemplated in paragraph (i) above will occur in accordance with applicable law and without
significant risk of clawback and (y) the Senior Notes Sellers Agent has, or (following the exercise of the Senior
Notes Only Call Option) will have, sufficient cash resources available to pay to the Senior Notes Issuer any
applicable amounts referred to in paragraph (ii) above.

Without prejudice to the set-off contemplated in paragraph (i) above, on the Senior Notes Liabilities Assignment
Date, the Senior Notes Liabilities Deferred Consideration shall automatically be reduced in an amount equal to
the Senior Notes Only Charged Property Value.

From the Senior Notes Liabilities Assignment Date until the day after the date on which the Senior Notes Only
Call Option may not be exercised, the Secured Creditors will not (i) cause or facilitate any reorganization or
restructuring of, or take any enforcement action with respect to (A) any company whose Investment Instruments
are Senior Notes Only Charged Property; or (B) any Subsidiary of any such company or (ii) dispose of any of
the Senior Notes Only Charged Property, without the consent of the Senior Notes Sellers Agent.

For the purposes of this Paragraph “—Senior Notes Only Charged Property Call Option” and “—Senior Notes
_Call Option”:_

“Senior Notes Seller” means each Senior Noteholder immediately after it has sold its Senior Notes further to the
exercise of the Senior Notes Call Option, it being specified that following the exercise of the Senior Notes Call
Option, the Senior Notes Sellers shall instruct the Senior Notes Sellers Agent according to the same rules
mutatis mutandis as those whereby the Senior Noteholders instruct the Senior Notes Trustee pursuant to the
relevant Senior Notes Indenture.

167


-----

“Senior Notes Sellers Agent” means, after the Senior Notes Call Option has been exercised, each Senior Notes
Trustee, which will act as the agent of the relevant Senior Notes Seller according to the same rules mutatis
mutandis as those governing such Senior Notes Trustee pursuant to the relevant Senior Notes Indenture.

**_Exit disposal_**

The taking of any steps towards making an Exit Disposal shall be treated as the enforcement of a Transaction
Security for all purposes under the Intercreditor Agreement where “Exit Disposal” means, following a
Foreclosure of certain Foreclosed Assets, a sale, disposal or transfer of: (a) such Foreclosed Assets, (b) any
Investment Instrument issued by a Secured Parties SPV holding such Foreclosed Assets or (c) if the Foreclosed
Assets consist of shares of any member of the Group, any assets held by such member of the Group or any
Subsidiary of it, in each case, to a person or persons which is not a member of the Group or a Secured Parties
SPV.

**_Turnover_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if at any time prior to the Final Discharge Date, subject to certain
exceptions, any Primary Creditor (or in the case of a Super Senior Creditor or Senior Secured Creditor only in
respect of the fourth paragraph below) or Subordinated Party (each a “Creditor”) or Secured Parties SPV
receives or recovers, inter alia:

- any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any liability owed by a Debtor which is
not a permitted payment under the Intercreditor Agreement or made in accordance with the order of priority
described under “—Application of Proceeds” below;

168


-----

- (except with respect to certain set-off rights, including set-off rights in relation to multi account overdraft
balances, and close-out netting and payment netting rights of hedge counterparties), any amount by way of
set off in respect of any liability owed by a Debtor which does not give effect to a permitted payment under
the Intercreditor Agreement;

- (except with respect to certain set-off rights) (i) on account of or in relation to any liability owed by a
Debtor after the occurrence of an Acceleration Event or as a result of the enforcement of any Transaction
Security (each, a “Distress Event”) or as a result of litigation or other proceedings against a member of the
Group (other than after the occurrence of an insolvency event in respect of that member of the Group), or
(ii) by way of set off in respect of any liability of a Debtor after the occurrence of a Distress Event;

- the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security, the proceeds of any Distressed Disposal
(including where any assets of a Debtor are disposed of outside of the Group by or on behalf of a Debtor
after a Distress Event), any Exit Disposal, any Soulte, any Cash Proceeds or the proceeds of any Assigned
Recourse Rights, except in accordance with the order of priority described under “—Application of
_Proceeds” below; or_

- (except with respect to certain set-off rights) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account
of or in relation to, any liability owed by any member of the Group which is not in accordance with the
order of priority described in “—Application of Proceeds” below and which is made as a result of, or after,
the occurrence of an insolvency event in respect of that member of the Group,

then that Creditor (or Secured Parties SPV as the case may be):

- in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set off, must hold that amount on
trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set off, must promptly pay an amount
equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Deferral of subrogation rights_**

If any Liabilities owed to the Secured Creditors (“Secured Creditor Liabilities”) are wholly or partly paid out of
any proceeds received in respect of or on account of the Senior Notes Liabilities owing to one or more Senior
Notes Creditors, those Senior Notes Creditors will to that extent be subrogated to the Secured Creditor
Liabilities so paid (and all securities and guarantees for those Secured Creditor Liabilities).

To the extent that a Senior Notes Creditor (a “subrogated creditor”) is entitled to exercise rights of subrogation,
each other Creditor (subject in each case to it being indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction
against any resulting costs, expenses and liabilities) will give such assistance to enable such rights so to be
exercised as such subrogated creditor may reasonably request.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Creditor, Subordinated Party or Debtor will exercise any rights which it may
have by reason of the performance by it of its obligations under the Debt Documents to take the benefit (in
whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights under the Debt Documents of
any Creditor which ranks ahead of it in accordance with the priorities set out in the Intercreditor Agreement
until such time as all of the Liabilities owing to each prior ranking Creditor (or, in the case of any Debtor, owing
to each Creditor) have been irrevocably paid in full.

No Subordinated Creditor will exercise any rights which it may have to take the benefit (in whole or in part and
whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights under the Debt Documents of any Creditor until such
time as all of the Liabilities owing to each Creditor have been irrevocably paid in full.

**_Assignment of recourse rights_**

In this section, “Recourse Rights” means any and all rights (including accessory rights such as security
interests), actions and claims that any member of the Group, any guarantor, any Debtor or any Security Provider
which has granted any Transaction Security or a guarantee in order to secure or guarantee all or part of the
secured obligations may have against any other person (whether a Debtor or not), in each case as a result of an

169


-----

enforcement action of any Transaction Security, enforcement of that guarantee or otherwise as a result of the
payment of such secured obligations in lieu of such other person, and including any right to be repaid by, to
receive any amount from or to be indemnified by, that other person (whether prior to or after enforcement), any
right of recourse by way of subrogation, recours subrogatoire, recours personnel or any other similar right,
action or claim under any applicable law, whether such right arise by law, contract or otherwise.

Each member of the Parent Group, each Security Provider and each Debtor irrevocably and unconditionally
assigns under the Intercreditor Agreement to the Security Agent acting in its name, all Recourse Rights (the
“Assigned Recourse Rights”) which it has or may have in the future (the Assigned Recourse Rights and the
amount thereof at any time being hereinafter referred to as the “Amount of the Assigned Recourse Rights”).

The consideration (the “Assigned Recourse Rights Deferred Consideration”) for the assignment of the Assigned
Recourse Rights shall be equal to the Amount of the Assigned Recourse Rights but shall be payable only to the
extent and when there are enough cash proceeds to be applied by the Security Agent to pay such Assigned
Recourse Rights Deferred Consideration in accordance with the waterfall provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Application of proceeds_**

Subject to certain exceptions as set out therein, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts received by
the Security Agent from the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security or a

_Distressed disposals_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that in relation to the disposal of an asset of a member of the Parent

on instructions from the Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security is enforceable; by
an enforcement of the Transaction Security; or after the occurrence of a Distress Event by or on behalf of a

Security Agent is authorized to (i) release the Transaction Security over the relevant asset; (ii) if the relevant
asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release that Debtor and any of its subsidiaries from its

shall not be treated as a Senior Creditor or secured party, and if it is intended that the transferee Debtor should
be a Senior Creditor or secured party, then all (and not part) of the liabilities owed to Senior Creditors, and all or

consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Majority Revolving Lenders, the requisite majority of Pari Passu
Creditors, each Senior Secured Notes Trustee, each Senior Notes Trustee and the Security Agent unless (i) such
amendments are made to cure defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes of a minor, technical or

requirements of any person proposing to act as the Revolving Agent, a Senior Secured Trustee, a Pari Passu
Debt Representative or a Senior Notes Trustee which are customary for persons acting in such capacity and
which would not have a material adverse effect,, which amendments may be made by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Security Agent. No amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or
additional obligations on any Primary Creditor without their prior written consent other than in the case of
Hedge Counterparties where the amendment does not adversely affect their rights, or where the rights of the
other Senior Creditors are also amended or waived to the same extent.

Majority Senior Secured Creditors.

The Security Agent may amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of, or grant consents under, any of
the Transaction Security Documents acting on the instructions of each representative, with the consent of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, unless provided otherwise under the relevant documents. No such amendment,
waiver or consent may affect the nature or scope of the obligations, the security or the manner in which the
proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed without the consent of the relevant party, save where
such amendment would affect the rights of Senior Creditors generally or save as provided under “Disposals”
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prior consent of the Revolving Agent only is required to authorize
any amendment or waiver of, or consent under, any Security Document that is entered into only for the benefit
of the Super Senior Creditors.

**Factoring agreement**

Cerba Selafa is party to a non-recourse factoring agreement with Natixis Factor SA. It incurred factoring fees
and factoring-related interest charges of a negligible amount during the year ended September 30, 2014.

The aggregate outstanding factoring cap under the agreement is approximately €10.0 million. As of
September 30, 2014, € 0.0 million was outstanding under the factoring facility. A commission of 0.07% of
amounts drawn under the factoring agreement is payable, subject to a minimum annual amount of €65,000. The
disbursement fee is based on the three-month EURIBOR plus a margin. The agreement is subject to customary
terms and conditions.

**Shareholder debt**

We are party to several debt financing instruments with our shareholders. In connection with the Offering, we
intend to make modifications to the terms of certain of these instruments to the extent necessary in order to
comply with the terms of the Indenture.

**_Other bonds_**

On June 10, 2011, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into a subscription agreement with Biopart
Investments for the issuance of € 10.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the “Biopart
Bonds”). On December 1, 2011, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into a subscription agreement with
Jean-Michel Damien for the issuance of €1.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the
“Damien Bonds” and together with the Biopart Bonds, the “Existing Management Vendor Loans”). The terms
of the notes issued pursuant to the Existing Management Vendor Loans are largely identical. The Existing
Management Vendor Loans bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum and mature on July 21, 2025. The Existing
Management Vendor Loans are redeemable (i) at any time at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
(ii) upon the first to occur of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s initial public offering or a change of control,
absent an agreement to the contrary between the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the borrower. As of
September 30, 2014, €15.0 million was outstanding under the Existing Management Vendor Loans, including
accrued but unpaid interest thereon.

**_PAI convertible bonds_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued convertible notes to its majority shareholder, Luxco, on four separate
occasions in 2010 and 2011 (the “PAI Convertible Bonds”). On July 21, 2010, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
issued Luxco €112.0 million aggregate principal amount of PAI Convertible Bonds. Subsequently, on
December 16, 2010, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued Luxco €6.5 million aggregate principal amount of
PAI Convertible Bonds. Additionally, on May 12, 2011, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued Luxco
€12.8 million aggregate principal amount of PAI Convertible Bonds. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued a
further € 3.6 million aggregate principal amount of PAI Convertible Bonds to Luxco on December 15, 2011. As
of September 30, 2014, the IFRS amount of the PAI Convertible Bonds is €7.0 million.

On December 11, 2012, Luxco exercised its option to convert the majority of the PAI Convertible Bonds into
158,109 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. On January 31, 2013, Luxco transferred the PAI Convertible Bonds
with aggregate amount of €10.1 million onto the books of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Financière Gaillon 13
SAS.

As of the Temporary Notes Issue Date, €10.1 million aggregate principal amount of PAI Convertible Bonds will
be outstanding. The bonds bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum. They are convertible into shares of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s Series B Preferred Stock at the option of the holder.

**_PAI shareholder loans_**

Luxco and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are party to a term loan agreement, dated as of January 6, 2012 and
amended on September 21, 2012, pursuant to which Luxco agreed to lend an aggregate amount of €13.0 million
to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in order to finance its acquisition activities (the “PAI Shareholder Loans”).
The loan accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The loan was payable in full on March 31, 2013, subject to
the prior repayment of amounts outstanding under the loan through set-off by issuances of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s equity to Luxco. As the loan was not repaid in full by March 31, 2013, the parties have agreed
that the repayment date shall be postponed to July 21, 2025, with such amended terms and conditions as to
match those of the PAI Convertible Bonds.

176


-----

On December 11, 2012, in set-off of a portion of the amounts outstanding of the PAI Shareholder Loans, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued 8,746 Class B Preferred Shares to Luxco, reducing the amount outstanding
under the PAI Shareholder Loans to €6.9 million. On January 31, 2013, Luxco transferred the PAI Shareholder
Loans with aggregate amount of €5.3 million onto the books of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Financière Gaillon
13 SAS.

As of September 30, 2014, €5.9 million was outstanding under the PAI Shareholder Loans, including accrued
but unpaid interest thereon.

**_French CPECs_**

In October 2010, the Senior Notes Issuer issued a total amount of € 326.93 million Series B and Series A
Convertible Preferred Equity Certificates, to the funds managed by PAI. On or about November 4, 2014 an
amount of €396.26 million of Frenchco CPECs and accrued and unpaid interest were converted to shares of the
Senior Notes Issuer, leaving €3.64 million of Frenchco CPECs and accrued and unpaid interest outstanding as of
that date which were transferred by PAI to Frenchco on November 4, 2014. The Frenchco CPECs and accrued
and unpaid interest bear interest at a rate of 9.90% per annum based on a 360-day year and the actual number of
days elapsed and mature in July 2025. Interest accrues daily and is payable annually unless such payment would
render the Senior Notes Issuer insolvent. The Frenchco CPECs are convertible into shares of the Senior Notes
Issuer at the option of Frenchco and are redeemable in cash at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer.

**Hedging obligations**

We enter into interest rate swaps from time to time in order to hedge against interest rate risk associated with
our borrowings subject to floating rates of interest. As the Notes have a fixed rate of interest, we do not
anticipate entering into any interest rate hedges in connection therewith.

**Existing Novescia Facilities**

Certain subsidiaries of Novescia have entered into bilateral credit facilities with a number of banks. As of
September 30, 2014, the financial debt of Novescia (the financial debt is the sum of the current and non-current
liabilities and the bank overdrafts) is €50.5 million. Loans have maturities ranging from 2016 to 2021 and
interest rates based on the three-month EURIBOR plus an annual margin. Certain of the bilateral credit facilities
are secured, either by the assets financed by the facilities or by assets of the borrowing entity or guaranteed by
letters of intent issued by Novescia. We intend to keep the Existing Novescia Facilities in place to financing the
ongoing operations of Novescia, as the change of control provisions, included therein are not triggered by the
Acquisition. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Description of the Senior Secured Notes**

In a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, Cerba European Lab S.A.S., a société par actions simplifiée organized under the laws of France
(the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer”), issued €85.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior secured
notes due 2020 (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”) under an indenture dated January 31, 2013 (the “Senior
_Secured Notes Indenture”), between, among others, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, certain subsidiaries of the_
Senior Secured Notes Issuer that guarantee the Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes Guarantors”),
Financière Gaillon 13 S.A.S. (“Holdco”), Cerberus Nightingale 1 S.à r.l. (“Top Luxco”), Cerberus Nightingale
2 S.A. (“Luxco” and, together with Top Luxco, the “Luxembourg Security Providers”), Wilmington Trust,
National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and Wilmington Trust (London) Limited, as security agent
(the “Security Agent”), pursuant to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer initially issued € 365.0 million senior
secured notes due 2020 (the “Initial Existing Senior Secured Notes”) and on May 23, 2014, issued an additional
€80.0 million senior secured notes due 2020 (together with the Initial Existing Senior Secured Notes, the
“Existing Senior Secured Notes”, and collectively with the Additional Senior Secured Notes, the “Senior
_Secured Notes”). The term “Senior Secured Notes” refers also to Book-Entry Interests (as defined below) in the_
Senior Secured Notes. Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Senior Secured Notes include those set forth in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The definitions of certain terms used in this description are set forth under the subheading “—Certain
_Definitions.” Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions”_
have the meanings assigned to them in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In this “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes,” references to (i) the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer” refer only to Cerba European Lab S.A.S._
and not to any of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) “we,” “our,” “us” refer to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries.

The €85.0 million aggregate principal amount of Additional Senior Secured Notes were issued upon the
exchange of the Temporary Senior Secured Notes.

The terms of the Senior Secured Notes include those set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Senior
Secured Notes Indenture is not qualified under, and is not be subject to, the U.S. Trust Senior Secured Notes
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”). Consequently, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
generally are not entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a
qualified indenture, including those requiring the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to resign in the event of certain
conflicts of interest and to inform the holders of the Senior Secured Notes of certain relationships between it and
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors. The Security Documents referred to
below under the caption “—Security” define the terms of the security that secure the Senior Secured Notes.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents and certain other agreements
relating to the Senior Secured Notes. It does not, however, restate any of those agreements in its entirety. You
should read the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents because they, and not this description, define your rights as a holder of the Senior Secured
Notes. Copies of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the form of the Global Notes (as defined below), the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents may be obtained upon request from the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer as set forth below under “—Listing and General Information.”

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has made an application for the Additional Senior Secured Notes to be
admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF
Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Euro MTF Market”). Please see “—Payments on the Senior
_Secured Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes.”_

The registered holder of a Senior Secured Note is treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
holders have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Principal, maturity and interest**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued €85.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of Additional Senior
Secured Notes in this Senior Secured Notes Offering. The Additional Senior Secured Notes will mature on
February 1, 2020, at which time 100% of the principal amount of the Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be
payable, unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. Subject to the covenant described under “—Certain

178


-----

_Covenants—Limitation on Debt,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is permitted to further issue additional Senior_
Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture from time to time after this Senior Secured Notes
Offering. The Senior Secured Notes and any further additional notes that are actually issued are treated as a
single class for all purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase, except for certain waivers and amendments. Unless the context otherwise
requires, references to the “Senior Secured Notes” for all purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and in
this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” include references to any additional notes that are actually issued
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including the Additional Senior Secured Notes issued pursuant to
this Senior Secured Notes Offering).

Interest on the Additional Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest on the
Additional Senior Secured Notes will accrue from February 1, 2015. Interest will be payable on each Note
semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The first interest payment for the Additional
Senior Secured Notes will be August 1, 2015. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will pay interest on each Note to
holders of record of each Note in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as of the immediately
preceding January 15 and July 15. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months (and in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days actually elapsed). Interest on
overdue principal and interest, including Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, will accrue at a rate
that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the Senior Secured Notes.

**Brief description of the senior secured notes and the senior secured note guarantees**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes:

- will be general obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

- will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

- will be guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors;

- will be secured by senior Liens over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral as described below under “—
_Security”; provided that the Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority Hedging Obligations will be_
repaid with the proceeds from any enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority to the
Senior Secured Notes;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such Debt; and

- will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are
not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors.

**_The Senior Secured Note Guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Note Guarantee of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor:

Senior Secured Note Guarantee of that Senior Secured Notes Guarantor;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of that Senior Secured Notes Guarantor that
is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such Debt;

- will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of that Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s Subsidiaries
that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors; and

- will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law.

As of the Completion Date no Novescia entity guarantees the Senior Secured Notes. Assuming we had
completed the Offerings and applied the proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” as of
September 30, 2014, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors would have had
total debt excluding shareholder debt of €799.6 million, including, without limitation, € 530.0 million of debt
outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, we would have had €80.0 million available for drawing
under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture permits the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Debt in the future. Giving effect to the Acquisition as if
it had occurred on October 1, 2013, and without guarantees from any Novescia entity for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2014, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors generated
approximately 71.9% of our Adjusted pro forma EBITDA, and as of September 30, 2014, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors held approximately 67.8% of our consolidated
total assets.

As of the Completion Date, all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries are “Restricted Subsidiaries”
for purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under
the caption “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer is permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

**Payments on the senior secured notes; paying agent, registrar and transfer agent for the senior**
**secured notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the
Senior Secured Notes in a member state of the European Union that are not obliged to withhold or deduct tax
pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of
the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law
implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying Agent
is Citibank N. A., London Branch in London.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and one or more
transfer agents in a member state of the European Union. The initial Registrar is Citigroup Global Markets
Deutschland AG. The initial transfer agent is Citibank N. A., London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a
register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes (as defined herein) outstanding
from time to time (the “Register”) and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes on the behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may change the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the transfer agent without prior
notice to the holders of Senior Secured Notes. For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules and
regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will publish a notice
of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by
such rules and regulations, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

No service charge will be made for any registration of a transfer, exchange or redemption of the Senior Secured
Notes, but the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or

180


-----

similar governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange (but not
for a redemption).

**Form of senior secured notes**

The Additional Senior Secured Notes were issued on the Completion Date only in fully registered form without
coupons and only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Additional Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) will initially be represented by a Global Note (as defined
below) in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Note”). The 144A Global Note
will be deposited, on the Completion Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Additional Senior Secured
Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by a Global Note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global
_Note” and, together with the 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will be_
deposited, on the Completion Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Please see “Book-Entry, Delivery
_and Form”._

**Transfer and exchange**

The Global Notes may be transferred in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Ownership of
interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have accounts with
Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in
the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification
requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers
of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or
Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by
Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants. Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note
(the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon
delivery by the transferor to the Registrar of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If definitive notes in registered form (“Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes”) are issued, they will be
issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other
documentation required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be
based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to,
the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €
100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery
thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other
things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of
the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions, and pay
any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without
charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

181


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any
Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes:

(a) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior Secured Notes;

(b) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Secured
Notes to be redeemed in part;

(c) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(d) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer, Excess Proceeds Offer or Senior Secured Notes Offer.

The Senior Secured Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as
described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Additional amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under or with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes or any of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors with respect to any Senior Secured Note
Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any
jurisdiction in which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is then
incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which
payment is made by or on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
(including the jurisdiction of any paying agent for the Senior Secured Notes) or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein (each, a “Tax Jurisdiction”) will at any time be required to be made
from any payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under or with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes or any of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors with respect to any Senior Secured Note
Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in
respect of such payments by each holder of Senior Secured Notes after such withholding, deduction or
imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts) will equal
the respective amounts that would have been received by the holder in respect of such payments in the absence
of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with
respect to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any
actual or deemed present or former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured
Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power
over, the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company
or corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been a resident,
citizen or national of such jurisdiction or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business there or
having or having had a permanent establishment therein for Tax purposes), but excluding any connection arising
merely from the holding of such Senior Secured Note, the enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured
Note or under a Senior Secured Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Senior Secured
Note or a Senior Secured Note Guarantee;

(b) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Senior
Secured Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first
made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes, or excise taxes
imposed on the transfer of Senior Secured Notes;

(d) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be
made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions

182


-----

of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law
implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive;

(e) Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Senior
Secured Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant
Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(f) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with
respect to, the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Note Guarantee;

(g) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the
holder or beneficial owner of Senior Secured Notes, following the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s written request
addressed to the holder or beneficial owner (and made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner
acting reasonably to comply with that request), to comply with any certification, identification, information or
other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax
Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes
imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner
is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is
legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(h) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other
than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such
payment had such holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Senior Secured Note;

(i) any Taxes payable under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the date of the
offering memorandum relating to the offering of the Initial Existing Senior Secured Notes (or any amended or
successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current
or future regulations or official interpretations thereof and any agreements (including any intergovernmental
agreements) entered into pursuant thereto; or

(j) any combination of items (a) through (i) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will also
pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or
any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other
reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery,
issuance, initial resale, enforcement or registration of any of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, any Senior Secured Note Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of
Senior Secured Notes other than the initial resale by the relevant initial purchasers), or the receipt of any
payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments
with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a)
through (e) or (g) through (i) above or any combination thereof), or any such taxes, charges or similar levies
imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Senior Secured
Notes or any Senior Secured Note Guarantee.

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware
that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Note Guarantee, each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the
relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
(copied to the Paying Agent) on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor shall notify the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate(s) must also set forth any other
information reasonably necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the
relevant payment date. The Senior Secured Notes Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will make or cause to be made
all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount

183


-----

deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from
each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will furnish to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, within a
reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax
receipts evidencing payment by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as the
case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other
evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably
requested by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Paying Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will provide to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee such information as may be
in the possession of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (and not otherwise
in the possession of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee) to enable the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to determine
the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors be required to disclose any information
that it reasonably deems to be confidential. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee be required to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder.

Whenever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” there is
mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes or of principal, redemption or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior
Secured Notes, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Senior Secured
Notes or any Senior Secured Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment
of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in
respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Senior Secured Notes, and will apply, mutatis
_mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior_
Secured Notes Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or
any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Senior Secured Notes (or any
Senior Secured Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.

**The senior secured note guarantees**

The Additional Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by BARC NV,
Biolille Société d’Exercice Libéral de Directeurs et Directeurs Adjoints en Laboratoire d’Analyse de Biologie
Médicale, Bioréunion, Biotop Développement, Centre Biologique du Chemin Vert, Cefid SA, Cerba Selafa,
CRI, LBS and LLAM SA as of the Completion Date. The Senior Secured Note Guarantees will be joint and
several obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors.

Each of the Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be contractually
limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Senior Secured Notes Guarantor without
rendering its guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, including laws relating to
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or
otherwise to reflect applicable laws, including laws relating to capital maintenance, corporate benefit and the
liability of directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s obligations
under its Senior Secured Note Guarantee or any security interest granted by such Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor, as applicable, could be significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes. Other debt of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor may not be similarly limited. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes—The Note Guarantees and the Security Interests over the Collateral may be limited_
_by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and_
_enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Senior Secured_
_Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The operations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Not all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries guarantee
the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt
and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s

184


-----

liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to participate
in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors,
except to the extent that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is itself
recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of
payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Indebtedness—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are_
_holding companies that have no revenue generating operations of their own and will depend on cash from the_
_operating companies of our group to be able to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes_
_or their respective Note Guarantees.” Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, after an acceleration event in_
respect of the Senior Secured Notes, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or other debt subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement, neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors may
make payments in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the other debt subject to the Intercreditor Agreement
(save for payments of certain agency or trustee fees, costs and expenses).

**_Release of the senior secured note guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Note Guarantees will be released:

(a) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of that Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
combination) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets” below;

(b) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor or any parent of that Senior Secured Notes Guarantor to a Person that is not (either
before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if
the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets” below and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted_
Subsidiary as a result of the sale, transfer or other disposition;

(c) with respect to the Senior Secured Note Guarantee of any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
that was required to provide such Senior Secured Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” upon such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor being
unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Debt giving rise to the requirement
to provide such Senior Secured Note Guarantee so long as no other Debt guaranteed by the relevant Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor would result in the requirement that such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor provide a
Senior Secured Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees” immediately after the release of such Senior Secured Note Guarantee;_

(d) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes;

(e) in accordance with the caption entitled “—Amendments and Waivers;”

(f) as a result of a transaction permitted by the third and fourth paragraphs under the caption
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets;”

(g) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of
_Senior Secured Notes Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”_

(h) upon the sale of all the Capital Stock of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, that Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor or any direct or indirect parent of that Senior Secured Notes Guarantor pursuant to a
security enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(i) if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

185


-----

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release as specified above, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee will execute
any documents reasonably requested in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in
respect of such guarantee. Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will
be required to make a notation on the Senior Secured Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Security**

**_General_**

The obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the obligations of the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors under their respective Senior Secured Note Guarantees will be secured by the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral on a senior basis.

As of the Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (as defined below) includes pursuant to the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture the following properties and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors:

(a) a first-ranking pledge over the Capital Stock of each of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors,
as well as CSS and BARC Finance, in each case that are owned by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) a first-ranking pledge over certain intercompany receivables and other obligations held by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors;

(c) a first-ranking pledge over certain bank accounts of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each
of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors; and

(d) a first-ranking pledge of the ongoing business (including intellectual property rights)
(nantissement de fonds de commerce) of Cerba Selafa.

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral includes, as of the Completion Date, the following properties
and assets of the Luxembourg Security Providers and Holdco:

(a) a first-ranking pledge over (i) the Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and other
debt and equity instruments issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer owned by Holdco; (ii) the Capital Stock
of Holdco and other debt and equity instruments issued by Holdco owned by Luxco and (iii) the Capital Stock
and other debt and equity instruments issued by Luxco owned by Top Luxco;

(b) a first-ranking pledge over certain bank accounts of Holdco and each of the Luxembourg
Security Providers;

(c) a first-ranking pledge over certain intercompany receivables of (i) Holdco from the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) Luxco from Holdco, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and (iii) Top Luxco from Luxco (including in respect of the Luxco
Proceeds Loan).

On November 4, 2014, we completed the Roll-Over transactions contemplated by the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. Prior to the completion of such transactions, 77.8% of the Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer was held by Holdco and the remainder was held directly and indirectly by members of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s executive board and certain other stockholders. Following the completion of the Roll-Over
transactions, 100% of the Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is held by Holdco (and pledged
under the relevant share pledge agreement), 100% of the Capital Stock of Holdco is by Luxco (and pledged
under the relevant share pledge agreement) and 100% of the Capital Stock of Luxco is held by Top Luxco
(and pledged under the relevant share pledge agreement). Consequently, the call options with respect to the
Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer no longer form part of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.
See “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” and “Principal Shareholders and Related Party
_Transactions.”_

The Senior Secured Notes Collateral relating to rights, property and assets of Holdco is referred to herein as
“Holdco Security” and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral relating to rights, property and assets owned by the
Luxembourg Security Providers is referred to herein as the “Luxco Security” (the Luxco Security, together with
Holdco Security, the “Structural Security”).

186


-----

The assets and property of the Luxembourg Security Providers, Holdco, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that are from time to time subject to, or required to be subject to, a Lien pursuant to the Security
Documents are referred to as the “Collateral.” The security and other agreements in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral are referred to as the “Security Documents.” The assets subject to the Structural
Security form part of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, and the instruments creating the Structural Security
constitute “Security Documents.”

The Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law,
including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally, or other restrictions applicable to security providers, including laws relating to capital
maintenance, corporate benefit and the liability of directors and officers.

The Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees also secure the
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations on a pari passu basis. Pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations will be entitled to
receive payment from the proceeds of enforcement of the Security Documents prior to the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to incur certain
additional Debt in the future that may share in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, including Debt with priority
rights to proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. The amount of such additional
Debt will be limited by the covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”
and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt.” Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional
Debt that may share in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral could be significant.

Under the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral is pledged by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, Holdco and the Luxembourg Security Providers to secure the
payment when due of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors’, as
applicable, payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Security Documents were entered into by, inter alios, the Security Agent
or its nominee(s), who will act as Security Agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
certain secured hedge counterparties, and for the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the holders of Senior
Secured Notes. The Security Documents governed by French law were also entered into by the beneficiaries of
the security.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests, the relevant Security Documents provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the
Security Agent, and the security interests in such jurisdictions secure the parallel debt (and not the Debt under
the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the other secured obligations). The parallel
debt construct has not been fully tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Notes—In certain jurisdictions, security over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent_
_rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may_
_be restricted by local law.”_

Each holder of Senior Secured Notes, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be deemed (i) to have
authorized the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agent to
enter into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of
Senior Secured Notes, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, appoints the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the
Security Agent, as the case may be, as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents
and authorizes it to act as such.

The holders of the Senior Secured Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore holders may
not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security
Documents. The holders may only act through the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Security Agent
(as creditor of the parallel debt, in respect of the Security Documents governed by French law), as applicable.
The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interests created by the Security Documents
(the “Security Interests”) that is in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders. The Senior Secured Notes Trustee will have the ability
to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents in accordance with

187


-----

the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Manner of Enforcement of Transaction Security.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Senior Secured Notes
Collateral, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, Holdco and the Luxembourg
Security Providers, as the case may be, have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, to
freely operate the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom
and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, are entitled to exercise any and
all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends,
non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options
and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing).

The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Note Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors’ obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, respectively,
and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note
Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Senior
Secured Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, subject to the terms
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Please see “Risk Factors—Additional Risks Related to the Senior
_Secured Notes—The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be_
_sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such Senior Secured Notes Collateral_
_may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances”._

No appraisals of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors in connection with this Senior Secured Notes Offering.
There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, in whole or in
part, pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents
following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes or the
Senior Secured Note Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be illiquid
and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all. See “Risk Factors—Additional Risks
_Related to the Senior Secured Notes—Your ability to enforce the pledges over shares of our French laboratory_
_companies will be limited by French law restrictions on the ownership of laboratory companies.”_

The Security Documents are governed by the laws of France, Belgium and Luxembourg and provide that the
rights with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture must be exercised by the
Security Agent and in respect of the entire outstanding amount of the Senior Secured Notes. The term “Security
_Interests” refers to the Liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._

Each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, Holdco and the Luxembourg
Security Providers shall, and shall procure that each of their respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, at their own
expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may require
(i) for registering any Security Document relating to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in any required register
and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Document relating to the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, for
facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for
facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver
of all or any part of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors, Holdco and the Luxembourg Security Providers shall, and shall procure that each of
their respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that
property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the
Security Agent may request.

**_Release of the security_**

The Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be released from the Liens over such Senior Secured Notes Collateral
under any one or more of the following circumstances:

188


-----

(a) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral other than the Structural Security, in
connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property or assets to a
Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets” below;_

(b) in the case of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor that is released from its Senior Secured Note
Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets,
and Capital Stock, of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor;

(c) upon a release of the Lien (the “Initial Lien”) that resulted in the creation of the Lien
(the “Senior Secured Notes Lien”) under the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens” so long as immediately after the release of the Senior Secured Notes Lien_
there is no other Debt secured by a Lien on the property and assets that was the subject of the Initial Lien and
Senior Secured Notes Lien that would result in the requirement for the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Note Guarantees to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to (or junior in respect of certain
obligations that are granted priority in accordance with clauses (b) and (d) of the definition of “Permitted
Collateral Liens”), such Lien;

(d) upon the full and final payment and performance of all financial obligations of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes;

(e) in accordance with the caption entitled “—Amendments and Waivers;”

(f) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of
_Senior Secured Notes Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”_

(g) in the case of a security enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the release of the property and assets subject to such enforcement sale;

(h) in respect of a release followed by an immediate retaking in accordance with the further
proviso in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest;”

(i) with respect to all or part of the Structural Security only, as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Maintenance of Double LuxCo Structure;”

(j) if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(k) in respect of the Luxco Security (except in respect of any Issuer Proceeds Loan constituting
Senior Secured Notes Collateral in accordance with clause (2)(p) of the “Limitation on Debt” covenant), upon a
Change of Control (other than in the context of an enforcement of the Luxco Security not involving a release in
accordance with clause (g) above).

Following written request by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and, if necessary, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee will take all necessary action required to effect any release of Collateral securing the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the
consent of the holders or any action on the part of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee.

**Optional redemption**

**_Optional redemption of senior secured notes prior to february 1, 2016, upon equity offering_**

At any time prior to February 1, 2016, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ written notice to holders of

any of its Subsidiaries) would remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such proposed
redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the

2017............................................................................................................................................ 101.750%
2018 and thereafter..................................................................................................................... 100.000%

notice to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
fixed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional
Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the
redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof),
if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior
Secured Note Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or

190


-----

any of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors with respect to any Senior Secured Note Guarantee, as the case may
be, is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as applicable, cannot avoid any such payment
obligation by taking reasonable measures available (including making payment through a paying agent located
in another jurisdiction), and the requirement arises as a result of:

(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the
applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date); or

(b) any amendment to, or change in, any existing official written interpretation or application of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not
been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date
(or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date)
(each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as applicable,
would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given.
Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Senior Secured Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an
opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been
such amendment or change which would entitle the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to redeem the Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, before the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Senior Secured Notes as described above, it will deliver to
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay
Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and that it is entitled to redeem such Senior
Secured Notes pursuant to the their terms.

The Senior Secured Notes Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and
opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as
described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor only after such Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor has become obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and
(b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring on or after the date on which such successor
Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Sinking fund; offers to purchase; open market purchases**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes as described under the captions “—
_Purchase of Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of_
_Certain Assets.” The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may at any time and from time_
to time purchase Senior Secured Notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Purchase of senior secured notes upon a change of control**

If a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs at any time, then the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must make
an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of Senior Secured Notes to repurchase all or any part
(equal to €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder’s Senior Secured Notes, at
a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change

191


-----

_of Control Purchase Date”) (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant regular record dates that are_
prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on an interest payment date). Purchases
made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture.

Unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured
Notes in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
deliver a notice to each holder of the Senior Secured Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise
deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice,” stating that a
Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Senior Secured Notes on the Change of
Control Purchase Date, and the notice will state:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase the
Senior Secured Notes on the date specified in the notice;

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding the transaction or
transactions that constitute a Change of Control;

(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be
a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later
date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws
or regulations;

(d) that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase
Price is not paid;

(e) that any Senior Secured Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue
interest; and

(f) any other procedures that a holder of Senior Secured Notes must follow to accept a Change of
Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance.

An agent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (expected to be the Paying Agent) will at the written direction of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Senior Secured Notes
properly tendered the Change of Control Purchase Price for such Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured
Notes Trustee (or the authenticating agent appointed by it) will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note or Senior Secured Notes equal in principal amount to any
unpurchased portion of Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Senior Secured Notes in
global form or to each holder of certificated Senior Secured Notes; provided that each new Note will be in a
principal amount of € 100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Purchase Date.

The ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would
constitute a Change of Control could trigger a mandatory repayment and cancellation of the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.
The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s future indebtedness and the future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may also
require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of
Control could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
possible financial effect on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of such repurchase.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot provide any assurance that it will
have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Senior Secured Notes that
might be delivered by holders of the Senior Secured Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. If the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer fails to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the Change of
Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Senior

192


-----

Secured Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes the rights described under “—Events
_of Default.”_

Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries may prohibit the prepayment of the Senior Secured Notes prior to their
scheduled maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant restricting the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer from offering to purchase the Senior Secured Notes if a pro forma leverage ratio is not met or a default
would occur under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement unless such purchase of the Senior Secured Notes
is funded with the cash proceeds of the issuance of shares by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the
contributions to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s equity capital. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer was so
prohibited from conducting a Change of Control Offer and not able to prepay any indebtedness containing any
such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would be unable to fulfill its
repurchase obligations to holders of the Senior Secured Notes who exercise their right to redeem their Senior
Secured Notes following a Change of Control, which would cause a Default or Event of Default under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture. A Default or Event of Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
unless waived by holders of the Senior Secured Notes, could result in a cross-default under certain of the
financing arrangements described under “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more
difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a
Change of Control, although it is possible that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer could decide to do so in the
future. Subject to limitations discussed below, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to incur additional Debt are contained in the covenants
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” and “—Limitation on Liens.” Such
restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (subject to the provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers”).
Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture will not require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer in the event of
certain highly leveraged transactions, or certain other transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring,
merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect holders of the Senior Secured Notes, if such transaction
is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if (1) a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a
default in payment of the applicable redemption price. The Change of Control provisions described above will
be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture are applicable. Any
such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, including the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive
agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the requirements of applicable tender offer rules, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with
a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events:

193


-----

(a) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer becomes aware of (by way of a report or any other filing
pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) any “person” or
“group” of related persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect
on the Issue Date), other than one or more Permitted Holders, is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined
in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more
than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (or any successor
entity permitted by the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and
_Sale of Assets”); provided that, for the purposes of this clause, (x) no Change of Control shall be deemed to_
occur by reason of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent and (y) any
Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the “beneficial owner” (as so defined) shall not be included in
any Voting Stock of which any such person or group is the “beneficial owner” (as so defined), unless that
person or group is not an affiliate of a Permitted Holder and has the sole voting power with respect to that
Voting Stock;

(b) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way
of merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole to a Person, other than or one or more Permitted Holders; or

(c) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or
dissolution other than in a transaction that complies with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.”_

The provisions under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be
waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes if made prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will publish notices relating to a
Change of Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of a Person.

**Selection and notice**

If fewer than all the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or
the Registrar will select the Senior Secured Notes for redemption by a method that complies with the
requirements, as certified to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Registrar by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Secured Notes are listed at such time or,
if the Senior Secured Notes are not listed on a securities exchange, pro rata, by a pool factor or by such other
method as the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Registrar in its sole discretion shall deem fair and
appropriate unless otherwise required by law; provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce
the portion of the principal amount of a Senior Secured Note not redeemed to less than €100,000. Neither the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with
this paragraph.

No Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by
first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Senior Secured
Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days
prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or
a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will
state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. While the Senior Secured Notes are
held in certificated form, a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note
will be issued in the name of the holder of Senior Secured Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Senior

194


-----

Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption
date, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes redeemed.

For Senior Secured Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or
Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for
communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Senior
Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the
Euro MTF Market of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes shall also be published in a
newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to
the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations, posted on the official website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection with any redemption, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes outstanding.

**Suspension of certain covenants when senior secured notes rated investment grade**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes attain an Investment Grade Rating from both
of the Rating Agencies and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture (a “Suspension Event”), beginning on the day of the Suspension Event and continuing
until such time (the “Suspension Period”), if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an
Investment Grade Rating from each Rating Agency (the “Reversion Date”), the covenants summarized under
the following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes and any related default provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt;”

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates;”

(4) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets;”

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees;”

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries;”

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries;” and

(8) “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” (but only clause (c) of the first
paragraph of such covenant).

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms on and after the
Reversion Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the Suspension Period, and the “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it had been in effect since the_
Issue Date, except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment
made during the Suspension Period. On the Reversion Date, all Debt incurred during the continuance of the
Suspension Period will be classified as having been incurred pursuant to clause (2)(d) of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt.” Any transactions prohibited by the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates” entered into after such reinstatement
pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to
clause (c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Transactions with Affiliates.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take_
any action described in clauses (a) through (d) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that_
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (2)(c) of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions
_Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.” No Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be required to_
comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” after such

195


-----

reinstatement with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period.
Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will send written notice to the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee.

**Certain covenants**

**_Limitation on debt_**

(1) The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, issue, incur, assume, guarantee or in any manner become directly
or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become responsible for, contingently or otherwise, the payment
of (individually or collectively, to “incur” or, as appropriate, an “incurrence”), any Debt (including Acquired
Debt); provided, however, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will be
permitted to incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if:

(a) after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof,
on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the
four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the incurrence of
such Debt, taken as one period, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and

(b) in the case of Senior Secured Debt, after giving effect to the incurrence of such Senior
Secured Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements
are available immediately preceding the incurrence of such Debt, taken as one period, would have been no
greater than (i) 4.5 to 1.0 and (ii) if such Senior Secured Debt is incurred in connection with or after the
occurrence of a Significant Acquisition by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
4.0 to 1.0.

(2) The first paragraph of this covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively, “Permitted
_Debt”):_

(a) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor of
Debt under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the greater
of (i) €50.0 million and (ii) 65% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, determined on a
pro forma basis (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) as per the most recent four fiscal
quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the incurrence of such Debt plus, in
the case of any refinancing of any Debt permitted under this clause (a) or any portion thereof, the aggregate
amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with
such refinancing, less the aggregate amount of all Net Cash Proceeds of Asset Sales applied by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the Issue Date to permanently repay any Debt under a
Credit Facility and effect a corresponding commitment reduction thereunder pursuant to the covenant described
below under the caption “—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets”; provided, however, that in no event shall such
reduction reduce the availability under this clause (2)(a) to less than €30.0 million;

(b) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors of
Debt represented by the Senior Secured Notes and the related Senior Secured Note Guarantees issued on the
Issue Date and any “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor

196


-----

(c) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of
intercompany Debt between the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary or between or
among Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that:

(i) if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is the obligor
on any such Debt and the payee is not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor, such Debt is unsecured and expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all
obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or
the Senior Secured Note Guarantee, in the case of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (A) except in
respect of Working Capital Intercompany Loans and (B) only to the extent legally permitted
(the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures
required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect such
Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such
Debt); and

(ii) (A) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to a Person (other than a
disposition, pledge or transfer to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and
(B) any transaction pursuant to which any Restricted Subsidiary that has Debt owing by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, will, in
each case, be deemed to be an incurrence of such Debt not permitted by this clause (c);

(d) any Debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt
described in clauses (a) and (b) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the
Transactions on the Issue Date;

(e) guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (i) the incurrence of the Debt being
guaranteed was permitted by another provision of this covenant and (ii) if the Debt being guaranteed is
subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes or to a Senior Secured Note Guarantee then such guarantee must be
subordinated to the same extent as the Debt being guaranteed;

(f) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt arising
from customary agreements providing for guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of earn-outs or other
purchase price adjustments or, in each case, similar obligations, in connection with the acquisition or disposition
of any business or assets or Person or any shares of Capital Stock of a Subsidiary, other than guarantees or
similar credit support given by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt incurred by
any Person acquiring all or any portion of such assets for the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided
that the maximum aggregate liability in respect of all such Debt permitted pursuant to this clause (f) will at no
time exceed the net proceeds, including the Fair Market Value of non-cash proceeds (the Fair Market Value of
such non-cash proceeds being measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent
changes in value) actually received from such disposition;

(g) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt under
Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or Commodity Hedging Agreements, in each case entered into
not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior
management of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) (collectively, “Hedging Obligations”);

(h) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of
Debt in the form of customer deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary course of business from
customers for services purchased in the ordinary course of business;

(i) [Intentionally omitted];

(j) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt in

advances or credit;

(k) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt arising
from (i) the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently
drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided that such Debt is extinguished

-----

within 30 days of incurrence, (ii) bankers’ acceptances, performance, surety, judgment, appeal or similar bonds,
warranties, or similar instruments or obligations, (iii) completion guarantees or performance or appeal bonds
provided or letters of credit obtained by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in the
ordinary course of business, (iv) VAT or other tax guarantees in the ordinary course of business,
(v) self-insurance obligations or captive insurance company obligations or the financing of insurance premiums
in the ordinary course of business and (vi) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or
setting-off arrangements;

(l) Debt of any Person incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise
combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt incurred to provide all or any portion of the
funds used to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary or that was otherwise incurred in connection with or contemplation of such acquisition); provided,
_however, that at the time of such acquisition or other transaction pursuant to which such Debt is deemed to be_
incurred, (x) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer could incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt under the
clause (1)(a) of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction or (y) the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

(m) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Permitted
Refinancing Debt incurred to renew, refund, replace, refinance, defease or discharge Debt incurred by it
pursuant to, or described in, paragraph (1) or clause (2)(b), (2)(d) (including, in the case of (2)(d), any Debt that
renews, refunds, replaces (whether upon or after termination or otherwise) or refinances any such Debt that has
been repaid, prepaid, purchased, repurchased, redeemed, defeased or otherwise extinguished, in whole or in
part), (2)(l) or this (2)(m) of this covenant, as the case may be;

(n) Contribution Debt;

(o) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt
represented by guarantees of any Management Advances;

(p) any guarantees by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor of
Parent Debt, the proceeds of which have been lent to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to an Issuer
Proceeds Loan, provided that such Issuer Proceeds Loan has been incurred in compliance with clause (1) or (2)
of this covenant other than this clause (2)(p), and such guarantees are subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, as applicable, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; provided further that such Issuer Proceeds Loan is pledged to secure the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees on a senior basis in accordance in the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

or equipment used in a Permitted Business of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries,
whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any
Debt incurred to renew, refund, replace, refinance, defease or discharge any Debt incurred pursuant to this
clause (q)(i) and (ii) the incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt
(other than and in addition to Debt permitted under clauses (a) through (p) above) in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Debt incurred to renew, refund,
replace, refinance, defease or discharge any Debt incurred pursuant to this clause (q)(ii), in an aggregate amount
for (i) and (ii) not to exceed the greater of (A) €35.0 million and (B) 4.0% of Total Assets; provided that no
Debt in excess of (x) €20.0 million or (y) after the occurrence of a Significant Acquisition by a Permitted

Capital Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Debt due to a change in IFRS
will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Debt for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining
compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Debt in euro where Debt is denominated in a different
currency, the amount of such Debt will be the Euro Equivalent determined on the date of such determination;
_provided that if any such Debt denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with_
respect to euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in euro
will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such Currency Agreement. The principal amount of any
refinancing Debt incurred in the same currency as the Debt being refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the
Debt refinanced determined on the date such Debt being refinanced was initially incurred, except to the extent
that such Euro Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Agreement (with respect to euro), in which case,
the amount of such refinancing Debt will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such Currency
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with
this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of
currencies or currency values will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur under the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(4) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant
(a) obligations with respect to letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Debt otherwise
included in the determination of such particular amount will not be included and (b) any Liens granted pursuant
to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens” covenant will
not be treated as Debt.

(5) For the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” under clause (2)(a)(ii) of this covenant,
_pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated_
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured
as at the time that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor obtains new
commitments (in the case of revolving facilities) or incurs new Indebtedness (in the case of term facilities).

(6) The amount of any Debt outstanding as of any date will be:

(a) in the case of any Debt issued with original issue discount, the accreted value of such Debt
and in the case of pay-in-kind Debt, the amount of such Debt shall include any interest paid in the form of
additional Debt;

(b) the principal amount of the Debt or the liquidation preference thereof, as applicable, in the
case of any other Debt determined in accordance with IFRS; and

(c) in respect of Debt of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person,
the lesser of:

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Debt of the other Person.

(7) If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Debt of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Debt is not permitted to
be incurred as of such date under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Restricted Subsidiary shall be in
Default of this covenant).

(8) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Debt described in
clauses (2)(a) through (q) of this covenant or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to clause (1) of this “—
_Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to_
classify items of Debt on the date of its incurrence and will only be required to include the amount and type of
such Debt in one of such clauses or paragraphs, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be entitled to divide
and classify an item of Debt in more than one of the types of Debt described in clauses (1) and (2) of this
covenant, and may change the classification of an item of Debt (or any portion thereof) to any other type of Debt
described in this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant at any time; provided that Debt incurred pursuant to
clause (2)(a) above may not be reclassified. Debt under the Revolving Credit Facility incurred or outstanding on
the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance of the exception provided in
clause (2)(a) above.

the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that are fair to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Restricted

unaffiliated Person, in each case, as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior
management of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

(h) the payment of customary director’s fees and indemnities and similar payments (including the

**_Limitation on liens_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Holdco and the Luxembourg Security Providers will not, and the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,
assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind securing Debt upon any of their property or assets now owned or
hereafter acquired, except (1) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Senior Secured Notes
Collateral, (a) Permitted Liens or (b) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees are secured at least equally and ratably
with, or, in the case of Liens in respect of Subordinated Debt, prior or senior to, the Debt secured by such Lien
for so long as such Debt is so secured and (2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Senior Secured
Notes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens. In the case of the Luxembourg Security Providers only, this
covenant shall cease to apply upon a Change of Control.

**_Limitation on sale of certain assets_**

(1) The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
consummate any Asset Sale unless:

(a) the consideration the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for
such Asset Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold or Capital Stock issued or sold or
otherwise disposed of; and

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Sale consists of (i) cash; (ii) Cash Equivalents; (iii) any securities,
notes or other obligations received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from
such transferee that are converted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or
Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash
Equivalents received in that conversion; (iv) the assumption by the purchaser of any liabilities, as recorded on
the balance sheet of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated
Debt), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified
against further liabilities; (v) Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt) that is no longer
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each
Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Debt in connection with such Asset Sale; (vi) any
Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (2)(e), (f) or (g) of this covenant; (vii) consideration
consisting of Debt (or the cancellation of Debt) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor from Persons who are not
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; (viii) any Designated Non-cash Consideration
received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale; provided that the
aggregate Fair Market Value of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, taken together with the Fair Market
Value at the time of receipt of all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received and designated as such
pursuant to this clause (viii), is less than (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) €
10.0 million; or (ix) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) to (viii).

(2) If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net
Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale, within 365 days after the consummation of such Asset Sale, may be used
or committed in a binding commitment to be used (provided that such Net Cash Proceeds are actually used
within the later of 365 days from the consummation of the Asset Sale or 180 days from the date of such binding
commitment) at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) to purchase the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of the Senior Secured
Notes at a purchase price equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase
(a “Senior Secured Notes Offer”);

(b) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay any Debt under Credit Facilities
(provided that in connection with any revolving credit borrowings under Credit Facilities, the related
commitment will be cancelled) incurred pursuant to clause 2(a) of the covenant described under the caption “—
_Limitation on Debt” that is secured by a Lien on assets or property which constitute Senior Secured Notes_
Collateral;

207


-----

(c) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay (i) except with respect to Debt that is
the subject of clause (b), any Debt (provided that in connection with any revolving credit borrowings under
Credit Facilities, the related commitment will not be required to be reduced) that is secured by a Lien on assets
or property which do not constitute Senior Secured Notes Collateral or (ii) any Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor;

(d) unless included in clause (2)(b) above, to purchase, or prepay or redeem or repay, any
Pari Passu Debt to the extent secured by a Lien on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral at a price equal to 100%
of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Debt so long as the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes an offer on a pro rata basis to all holders of the Senior Secured
Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase;

(e) to acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(f) to make a capital expenditure;

(g) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) that are used or useful in a Permitted
Business; or

(h) any combination of the foregoing.

(3) Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds (including cash or Cash Equivalents received
from the conversion of any securities, notes or other obligations), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such
Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

(4) Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in clause (2) of
this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may also at any time, and the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer will within ten Business Days after the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
exceeds €10.0 million, make an offer (an “Excess Proceeds Offer”) to purchase, prepay or redeem with the
proceeds of sales of assets the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Debt, to the
extent required by the terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt. The offer price for the
Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt will be payable in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Senior Secured Note (and solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt, no greater than 100%
of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Debt), plus in each case accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of purchase and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment
or redemption.

(5) To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu
Debt tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer (or applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds
not used to purchase the Senior Secured Notes and other Pari Passu Debt for general corporate purposes that are
not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be prepaid or validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders
thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu
Debt to be purchased will be purchased, prepaid or redeemed, as applicable, on a pro rata basis (based upon the
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari Passu
Debt to be prepaid or tendered by each holder). Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the
amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes to
be purchased exceeds the amount of proceeds received for application to such principal amount, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee will select the Senior Secured Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the
manner described under “—Selection and Notice”), based on the amounts tendered.

(6) If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is obligated to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will purchase the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in
whole or in part in integral multiples of €1,000, on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and not later than
60 days from the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such holders, or such later date as may

208


-----

be required under the Exchange Act; provided that no Note of less than €100,000 remains outstanding
thereafter.

(7) The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations
are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an Excess Proceeds
Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale
provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their respective obligations
under the Asset Sale provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Additional guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of any other Debt of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and
delivers a supplemental indenture to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture providing for a Senior Secured Note
Guarantee of the payment of the Senior Secured Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Senior Secured
Note Guarantee will be pari passu with or senior to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Debt.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall ensure that within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date, either:

(1) (a) the aggregate Consolidated EBITDA (determined separately, without double counting and
excluding any Consolidated Adjusted Net Income or adjustments attributable to Subsidiaries of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor) for such fiscal year of each of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors shall equal or exceed 80% of Consolidated EBITDA for
such ended fiscal year of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and

(b) the aggregate combined assets (determined separately, without double counting (for the
avoidance of doubt, all intra-group items and investments in Subsidiaries by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be excluded)) as of the last day of such fiscal year of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors shall equal or exceed 85% of the Total Assets; or

(2) if all Obligors (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) are Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer complies with
the Percentage Test (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on the Issue Date, and if such
definition is no longer used or applicable under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, then only clause (1) of
this paragraph shall apply),

by causing one or more of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors to become
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors to the extent necessary to ensure the foregoing thresholds are met. A
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor may become a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor if it executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture providing
for a Senior Secured Note Guarantee of the payment of the Senior Secured Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary
on the terms and conditions set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Guarantees.

Each additional Senior Secured Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary
(a) existing on the Issue Date, (b) that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the
guarantee was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary or (c) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of
not less than €250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A or the
equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody’s, in connection with the
operation of cash management programs established for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiaries.

209


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not be obligated to cause a Restricted
Subsidiary to guarantee the payment of the Senior Secured Notes to the extent that such Senior Secured Note
Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (a) a violation
of applicable law, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably
available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary; (b) any liability for the officers,
directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (c) significant cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than reasonably
expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result or, or any
measures pursuant to clause (b) undertaken in connection with, such Senior Secured Note Guarantee, which
cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on dividend and other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries_**

(1) The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its
Capital Stock to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other
interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any other Restricted
Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any other
Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(2) The provisions of the covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to encumbrances or
restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(a) the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), the Senior Secured
Note Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(b) any agreements or instruments with respect to Debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of “—
_Limitation on Debt,” and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,_
replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that such encumbrances or restrictions taken as a
whole, as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior management of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date
or (ii) is customary in comparable financings and where, in the case of this subclause (ii), the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer determines at the time such Debt is incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Senior Secured Notes Issuers’ ability to make principal or interest
payments on the Senior Secured Notes (as determined in good faith by the board of directors);

(c) any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and any amendments, restatements, modifications,
renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the
amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are
not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions

210


-----

than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the board of
directors or a member of senior management of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer);

(d) customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases and licenses entered into
in the ordinary course of business;

(e) any agreement or other instrument of a Person (including its Subsidiaries), acquired by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in effect at the time of such acquisition (but not
created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the
properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired
(including its Subsidiaries);

(f) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or substantially all
the property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary
pending its sale or other disposition;

(g) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under the
caption “—Limitation on Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

(h) applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the terms of any governmental licenses,
authorizations, concessions, franchises or permits;

(i) encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or
suppliers or required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts entered into in
the ordinary course of business;

(j) customary limitations on the distribution or disposition of assets or property in joint venture
agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar
agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), which limitations
are applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements;

(k) Purchase Money Obligations and mortgage financings for property acquired in the ordinary
course of business and Capitalized Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or
leased of the nature described in clause (1)(d) of the preceding paragraph;

(l) any Qualified Securitization Financing; and

(m) any agreement that extends, renews, amends, modifies, restates, supplements, refunds,
refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (2)(a)
through (l), or in this clause (2)(m); provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or
restrictions are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes than
those under or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, amended, modified, restated, supplemented,
refunded, refinanced or replaced.

**_Lines of business_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any
business other than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**_Designation of unrestricted and restricted subsidiaries_**

The board of directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing at the time of or
after giving effect to such designation and such Subsidiary to be so designated or any of its Subsidiaries does not
own any Capital Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on any property of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any other Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so
designated or otherwise an Unrestricted Subsidiary. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed
to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted
Payments under the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or

211


-----

under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in
such Subsidiary would be permitted at that time under the covenant “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” The
board of directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a
Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
evidenced to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee by filing with the Senior Secured Notes Trustee a copy of a
resolution of the board of directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that
such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above
under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” The board of directors of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such
designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Debt by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Debt of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Debt is permitted under the
covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Debt,” calculated on a pro forma basis as if such
designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of
Default would be in existence following such designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer as a Restricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee by
filing with the Senior Secured Notes Trustee a copy of a resolution of the board of directors giving effect to such
designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions.

**_Provision of information_**

So long as the Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will furnish to the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee:

(a) within 120 days after the end of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, annual reports containing the following information with a level of
detail that is substantially comparable in all material respects to the offering memorandum relating to the
offering of the Initial Existing Senior Secured Notes: (i) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years,
including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of its independent auditors on the
financial statements; (ii) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any acquisition or disposition that, individually or in the
aggregate when considered with all other acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since the beginning of
the most recent completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates, represent greater than 20% of the
consolidated revenues, EBITDA, or assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on a pro forma basis or material
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which
such annual report relates, in each case unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous report
pursuant to clause (b)(ii) or (b)(iii) below; (iii) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the consolidated results of operations, financial condition, EBITDA and
liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies, capital
expenditures and critical accounting policies; (iv) a description of the business, management and shareholders of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, material affiliate transactions, material debt instruments and material contracts;
and (v) material risk factors and material recent developments;

(b) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2013, all quarterly financial
statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer containing the following information: (i) an unaudited condensed
combined balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash
flow for the most recent year-to- date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the
comparable prior year period (which may be presented on a pro forma basis), together with condensed footnote
disclosure; (ii) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
together with explanatory footnotes, for any acquisition or disposition that, individually or in the aggregate
when considered with all other acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates, represent greater than 20% of the
consolidated revenues, EBITDA or assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on a pro forma basis or material
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to
which such quarterly report related, in each case unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous
report pursuant to clause (b)(i) or (b)(iii); (iii) an operating and financial review (containing information with a

212


-----

level of detail that is substantially comparable in all material respects to the interim period in the offering
memorandum relating to the offering of the Initial Existing Senior Secured Notes) of the unaudited financial
statements, including a discussion of the consolidated results of operations, financial condition and EBITDA
and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any material
change between the current year-to-date period and the corresponding period of the prior year; and (iv) material
recent developments and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition, restructuring or
business consolidation or combination of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or any senior executive officer changes at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or change in auditors of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any other material event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer announces
publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

All historical financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS on a consistent basis for the
periods presented. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any disclosure with
respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the
offering memorandum relating to the offering of the Initial Existing Senior Secured Notes and in no event
(i) shall U.S. GAAP information or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP be required or (ii) such report shall include
separate financial statements for any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
will also (i) file a press release with the appropriate internationally recognized wire services (including, without
limitation, through the newswire service of Bloomberg, or if Bloomberg does not then operate, any similar
agency) in connection with such report or (ii) post each such report on such website as may be then maintained
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

So long as any of the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make available to any prospective
purchaser of Senior Secured Notes or beneficial owner of Senior Secured Notes in connection with any sale
thereof the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

At any time that any of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any
such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by
the first paragraph of this “—Provision of Information” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation,
either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of

to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the Commission or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects
to provide reports which, if filed with the Commission, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the
provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and
procedures), for so long as it elects, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make available such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file

all of the properties or assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

-----

(a) at the time of, and immediately after giving effect to, any such transaction or series of
transactions, either (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be the surviving Person or (ii) the Person (if other
than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger or to which such
sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially all the properties and assets of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis has been made
(the “Surviving Entity”):

(x) will be a Person duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union as in effect on December 31, 2003, Switzerland, Canada,
the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; and

document, in each case, delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma
basis (and treating any obligation of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred in

_Debt” covenant or (ii) have a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not less than it was immediately prior_
to giving effect to such transaction;

(d) (i) except to the extent any Liens are amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
modified or otherwise released and retaken in accordance with “—Impairment of Security Interest,” the Liens
on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will remain in full force and effect securing the Senior Secured Notes;
and (ii) in connection with a Significant Acquisition by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or the Surviving Entity shall pledge its Capital Stock in any direct Subsidiaries that became
Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note
Guarantees on a senior basis in accordance in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and (iii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any Surviving Entity shall remain in compliance with

supplemental indenture, comply with this covenant and that the supplemental indenture and the Senior Secured
Notes constitute the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s or Surviving Entity’s legal, valid and binding obligations,
enforceable (subject to customary qualifications) in accordance with their terms.

The Surviving Entity will succeed to, be substituted for and may exercise every right and power of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents.

A Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (other than any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor whose Senior Secured Note
Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Note Guarantee and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture as described under “—The Senior Secured Note Guarantees”) will not, directly or
indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not such Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor is the surviving Person), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which
are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(a) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

214


-----

(b) either:

(i) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed
by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor)
assumes all the obligations of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under its Senior Secured Note
Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is
party pursuant to a supplemental indenture, accession agreement and appropriate security documents
delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent; or

(ii) the Net Cash Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notwithstanding clauses (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant and clause (a) of the second
paragraph of this covenant (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence) (i) any Restricted
Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may
consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor. In addition, clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in another
jurisdiction for tax reasons.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of a Person.

**_Center of main interests and establishments_**

Prior to a Change of Control, each of the Luxembourg Security Providers will, for the purposes of The Council
of the European Union Regulation No. 1346/2000 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Proceedings
_Regulation”) or otherwise, ensure that its center of main interest (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the_
Insolvency Proceedings Regulation) is situated in its original respective jurisdiction of organization and ensure
that it has no “establishment” (as that term is used in Article 2(b) of the Insolvency Proceedings Regulation) in
any other jurisdiction where to do so could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the interests of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, prior to a Change of Control each of the Luxembourg
Security Providers will:

(a) hold all meetings of its board of directors in Luxembourg (with members present or by
telephone (in which case the conference call shall be initiated from Luxembourg by one of the directors));

(other than voting power in respect of directors’ qualifying shares or shares (or other voting power in the Voting
Stock) required by applicable law to be held by a Person other than Luxco or such Successor Person), and

215


-----

Luxco or such Successor Person will ensure that all of the Capital Stock of Holdco or its successor Person (other
than directors’ qualifying shares or shares (or other Capital Stock) required by applicable law to be held by a
Person other than Luxco or its successor Person) constitutes Senior Secured Notes Collateral; (ii) upon and
subsequent to a Roll-Over, if any, but prior to a Significant Acquisition by Holdco, if any, or a Top Luxco
Roll-Over, if any, directly at least 70.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of Holdco or such

to be held by a Person other than Luxco or its successor Person), and Luxco or its successor Person will ensure
that all of the Capital Stock of Holdco or its successor Person (other than directors’ qualifying shares or shares

Person) constitutes Senior Secured Notes Collateral (including call options in respect of Qualified Capital Stock

power in respect of directors’ qualifying shares or shares (or other voting power in the Voting Stock) required
by applicable law to be held by a Person other than Luxco or its successor Person) is owned and held by any

beneficiaries), Investor Companies, Management Investment Companies, Management Investors, Manco and/or
Senior Management; provided further that in the case of each of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), upon the consummation

Luxco, or its successor Person pursuant to this covenant shall be proportionally decreased and the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral in respect of the Qualified Capital Stock of Holdco or such successor Person offered in
such Public Equity Offering may be released and will no longer be required to constitute Senior Secured Notes
Collateral; and

(c) Holdco or any successor Person will not sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of Voting Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any successor Person and will not otherwise
cease to own and hold (i) prior to any Roll-Over, any Top Luxco Roll-Over and any Significant Acquisition by a

Acquirer, if any, directly at least 90.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or such successor Person (other than voting power in respect of directors’ qualifying shares or
shares (or other voting power in the Voting Stock) required by applicable law to be held by a Person other than

spouses, family members, heirs, estate trusts, executors, administrators or beneficiaries), Investor Companies,
Management Investment Companies, Management Investors, Manco and/or Senior Management.

(d) Any requirement for Capital Stock to constitute Senior Secured Notes Collateral in this
covenant is a requirement that such Senior Secured Notes Collateral secures the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Note Guarantees on a senior basis (or constitutes call options granted to the Security Agent for
the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Senior Secured Notes Guarantors) in
accordance in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Nothing in this

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, Holdco and the Luxembourg Security
Providers will not, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which might or would have the result
of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (it being

or decree (by reason of pending appeal, waiver or otherwise) shall not have been in effect;

(h) (i) the Security Interests purported to be created under any Security Document (with respect to
Collateral) having a Fair Market Value in excess of €5.0 million (other than in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) will, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect and constitute a valid and
perfected Lien with the priority required by the applicable Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and discharge of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional

Secured Notes Issuer, Holdco, any Luxembourg Security Provider or any Restricted Subsidiary granting
Collateral that is the subject of any such Security Interest asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent
jurisdiction, that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and such failure to be in full force and

(i) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

Notes Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding by written notice to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer (and to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee if such notice is given by the holders) may, and
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, upon the written request of such holders, shall, declare the principal of,
premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration all such amounts payable in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes will become immediately due and payable.

(3) If an Event of Default specified in clause (1)(i) above with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts and accrued and
unpaid interest on all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes shall become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or any holder of Senior
Secured Notes.

(4) The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee may
on behalf of the holders of all of the Senior Secured Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium
and Additional Amounts, if any, of the principal of any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting holder,
which may only be waived with the consent of holders of the Senior Secured Notes holding 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture)
and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (except if such
rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). In the event of any Event of
Default specified in clause (e) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any
resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes) shall be annulled,
waived or rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the holders, if
within 20 days after such Event of Default arose:

(i) the indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged;

(ii) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the
case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(iii) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

229


-----

(5) At any time after a declaration of acceleration under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes, by written notice
to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, may rescind such declaration and its
consequences if:

(a) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has paid or deposited with the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
(or another party designated by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee for this purpose) a sum sufficient to pay:

(i) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts on all Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding;

(ii) all unpaid principal of and premium, if any, on any outstanding Senior Secured Notes
that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate
borne by the Senior Secured Notes;

(iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest
and overdue principal at the rate borne by the Senior Secured Notes; and

(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the properly incurred compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, its agents and counsels;

(b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction; and

(c) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of amounts of principal of, premium, if any,
and any Additional Amounts and interest on the Senior Secured Notes that has become due solely by such
declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

(6) Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Senior Secured Notes may direct the Senior Secured Notes Trustee in its exercise of any trust
or power.

(7) In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee will be under
no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or
direction of any holders of the Senior Secured Notes unless such holders have made written request and offered
to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under “—Amendments and
_Waivers”) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional_
Amounts when due, no holder of any of the Senior Secured Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any remedy thereunder, unless the holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have made written request to, and offered
indemnity and security satisfactory to, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee has
failed to institute such proceeding within 30 days after receipt of such written notice and indemnity and security
and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee within such 30- day period has not received directions inconsistent with
such written request by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Senior Secured Note for the
enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such
Senior Secured Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Senior Secured Note.

(8) If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee will deliver to each holder of the Senior Secured Notes notice of the
Default or Event of Default within 30 Business Days after its actual knowledge of such occurrence. Except in
the case of a Default or an Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or
interest on any Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee may withhold the notice to the holders
of such Senior Secured Notes if a committee of its trust officers in good faith determines that withholding the
notice is in the interests of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

230


-----

(9) The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to furnish to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee annual
statements regarding compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and as to the occurrence of a Default
or Event of Default. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is also required to notify the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
in writing within 30 days of the occurrence of any Default (unless cured) or Event of Default stating what
action, if any, it is taking with respect to such Default or Event of Default.

**Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of senior secured notes indenture**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may at any time, at the option of its board of directors evidenced by a
resolution set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes issued under an Senior Secured Notes Indenture and all obligations of the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors discharged with respect to their applicable Senior Secured Note Guarantees
(“Legal Defeasance”) except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Senior Secured Notes to receive payments in respect of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Amounts, if any)
when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(b) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Senior Secured Notes,
register, transfer or exchange any Senior Secured Notes, replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior
Secured Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and segregate
and hold such payments in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors in connection
therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors released with respect to certain
covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Excess Proceeds Offers) set forth in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such
covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. In the
event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under “—Events of Default” will no longer
constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. These events do not include events
relating to non-payment or, solely with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership and reorganization. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option
regardless of whether it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (or such other entity nominated by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee for this
purpose), for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, cash in euro, non- callable European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the
opinion of internationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants,
to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Amounts, if any), on
the outstanding Senior Secured Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case
may be, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must (x) specify whether the Senior Secured Notes are being
defeased to such Stated Maturity or to a particular redemption date; and (y) if applicable, have delivered to the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such
principal, premium, if any, or interest;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must have delivered to the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
stating that (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in applicable
U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that,
the beneficial owners of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for

231


-----

U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal
Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must have delivered to
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee to the effect that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must have delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with the intent of
preferring the holders of the Senior Secured Notes over the other creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
others; and

(e) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must have delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee,
subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the
Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Senior
Secured Notes issued thereunder when:

(a) either:

(i) all the Senior Secured Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than
destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes that have been replaced or paid and Senior Secured
Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust and
thereafter repaid to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or discharged from such trust as provided for in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) have been delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee) for cancellation; or

(ii) all Senior Secured Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent
(and notified to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee) for cancellation (x) have become due and payable
(by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise) or (y) will become due and payable
within one year and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor has
irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (or such other
entity nominated by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee for this purpose) as trust funds in trust solely for
the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, cash in euro, non-callable European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient,
without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Debt on the
Senior Secured Notes not delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee) for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or
redemption; and

(b) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor has paid or caused to
be paid all sums payable by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes; and

(c) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Paying Agent and
copied to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case
may be.

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must deliver to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all
conditions precedent provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of

232


-----

the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any
Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c)).

**Concerning the senior secured notes trustee**

The Senior Secured Notes Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any
conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Senior Secured Notes Trustee.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes will have
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available
to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will
provide that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee will be
required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own
affairs. The Senior Secured Notes Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request of any holder of Senior Secured Notes, unless such
holder has offered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses incurred without negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with its duties.

Memorandum may be obtained, free of charge, during normal business hours at the registered office of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, Holdco or any Luxembourg Security Provider will have any liability for any
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, Holdco or the
Luxembourg Security Providers under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, the
Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of such obligations or their creation. Each holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.
Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed five years after the
applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees are
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and will provide for the
submission of the parties to the jurisdiction of the courts in the State of New York. The Security Documents will
be governed by the laws of France, Belgium and Luxembourg.

and for actions brought under U.S. Federal or state securities laws brought in any Federal or state court located
in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

**Enforceability of judgments**

Since most of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are outside
the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any,
interest, Additional Amounts, redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes, may not be collectible within the United States.

controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. For the purposes of this

**Description of the Senior Notes**

In a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, Cerberus Nightingale 1 S.A., a société anonyme organized under the laws of Luxembourg (the
“Senior Notes Issuer” or “Top Luxco”), issued €145.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior
notes due 2020 (the “Senior Notes “) under an indenture dated the Completion Date (the “Senior Notes
_Indenture”), between, among others, the Senior Notes Issuer, certain subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer,_
including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, that guarantee the Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes Guarantors”),
Financière Gaillon 13 S.A.S. (“Holdco”), Cerberus Nightingale 2 S.A. (“Luxco”), Wilmington Trust, National
Association), as trustee (the “Senior Notes Trustee”), and Wilmington Trust (London) Limited, as security agent
(the “Security Agent”). The term “Senior Notes” refers also to Book-Entry Interests (as defined below) in the
Senior Notes. Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Senior Notes include those set forth in the Senior Notes
Indenture.

The definitions of certain terms used in this description are set forth under the subheading “—Certain
_Definitions.” Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions”_
have the meanings assigned to them in the Senior Notes Indenture. In this “Description of the Senior Notes,”
references to (i) the “Senior Notes Issuer” refer only to Cerberus Nightingale 1 S.A. and not to any of its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

The €145.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes were issued upon the exchange of the
Temporary Senior Notes.

The terms of the Senior Notes include those set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture. The Senior Notes Indenture
is not qualified under, and is not subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”).
Consequently, the holders of the Senior Notes generally will not be entitled to the protections provided under
the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those requiring the Senior
Notes Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform the holders of the Senior Notes
of certain relationships between it and the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Guarantors. The Security
Documents referred to below under the caption “—Security” define the terms of the security that will secure the
Senior Notes.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes
and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents and certain other agreements relating to the
Senior Notes. It does not, however, restate any of those agreements in its entirety. You should read the Senior
Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents because they, and
not this description, define your rights as a holder of the Senior Notes. Copies of the Senior Notes Indenture, the
form of the Global Notes (as defined below), the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents may be
obtained upon request from the Senior Notes Issuer as set forth below under “—Listing and General
_Information.”_

The Senior Notes Issuer has made an application for the Senior Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange (the “Euro MTF Market”). Please see “—Payments on the Senior Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar and
_Transfer Agent for the Senior Notes.”_

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will
have rights under the Senior Notes Indenture.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Senior Notes Issuer issued €145.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in this Offering.
The Senior Notes will mature on February 1, 2020, at which time 100% of the principal amount of the Senior
Notes shall be payable, unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. Subject to the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt,” the Senior Notes Issuer is permitted to issue additional
Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture from time to time after this Offering (the “Additional Senior
_Notes”). The Senior Notes and any Additional Senior Notes that are actually issued will be treated as a single_
class for all purposes of the Senior Notes Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase, except for certain waivers and amendments. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the
“Senior Notes” for all purposes of the Senior Notes Indenture and in this “Description of the Senior Notes”
include references to any Additional Senior Notes that are actually issued under the Senior Notes Indenture.

The Senior Note Guarantee of each Senior Notes Guarantor:

- will be a general obligation of that Senior Notes Guarantor;

- will be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future Senior Debt of that Senior Notes
Guarantor, including that Senior Notes Guarantor’s obligations under, guarantee of, the Senior Secured
Notes and Debt incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility;

- will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior subordinated Debt of that Senior
Notes Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Note Guarantee;

- will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Debt of that Senior Notes Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Note Guarantee;

- will be secured by a second-ranking security interest in the Senior Notes Collateral, as described below
under “—Security;”

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of that Senior Notes Guarantor that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Note Guarantee or that is secured on a
first-priority basis by property or assets that secure the Senior Note Guarantee on a second-priority basis, to
the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Debt;

- will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of that Senior Notes Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that are not
Senior Notes Guarantors; and

268


-----

- will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law.

As of the Completion Date no entity comprising Novescia guarantees the Senior Notes. Assuming we had
completed the Offering and applied the proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” as of
September 30, 2014, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors would have had total debt of
€799.6 million, €530.0 million in Senior Secured Notes and €145.0 million in Senior Notes. In addition, we
would have had €80 million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Senior Notes
Indenture permits the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Debt in the future.
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, and without guarantees from any Novescia entity, the Senior
Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors generated approximately 71.9% of our Adjusted pro forma
EBITDA, and as of September 30, 2014 the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors held
approximately 67.8% of our consolidated total assets. Due to restrictions under French law, the Senior Notes
Guarantees of the Post-Completion Date Senior Notes Guarantors will effectively have no monetary value as
none of them will be lent any of the proceeds of the Offering of the Senior Notes.

As of the Completion Date, all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries are “Restricted Subsidiaries” for
purposes of the Senior Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” the Senior Notes Issuer is
permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Senior Notes Issuer are not subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Notes Indenture and do not
guarantee the Senior Notes.

**Payments on the Senior Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Notes**

The Senior Notes Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Senior Notes
in a member state of the European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the
European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN
Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing, or
complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying Agent will be Citibank
N.A., London Branch in London.

The Senior Notes Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and one or more transfer
agents in a member state of the European Union. The initial Registrar will be Citigroup Global Markets
Deutschland AG. The initial transfer agent will be Citibank N.A., London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a
register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein) outstanding from time to time
(the “Register”) and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered Notes on the behalf
of the Senior Notes Issuer.

The Senior Notes Issuer may change the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the transfer agent without prior notice to
the holders of Senior Notes. For so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules and regulations of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying
Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and
regulations, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

No service charge will be made for any registration of a transfer, exchange or redemption of the Senior Notes,
but the Senior Notes Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar
governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange (but not for a
redemption).

**Form of Senior Notes**

The Senior Notes were issued on the Completion Date only in fully registered form without coupons and only in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Senior Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) will initially be represented by a Global Note (as defined below) in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Note”). The 144A Global Note was deposited, on the
Completion Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Senior Notes sold outside the United States pursuant

269


-----

to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by a Global Note in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the 144A Global Note, the
“Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note was deposited, on the Completion Date, with a common
depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream. Please see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Global Notes may be transferred in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture. Ownership of interests in
the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or
Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the
Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification
requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers
of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or
Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by
Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants. Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note (the
“Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry
Interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the
transferor to the Registrar of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Notes Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book- Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If definitive notes in registered form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) are issued, they will be issued only in
minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon
receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by
the Senior Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior
Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Senior Notes Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be
subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described
more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive
Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Senior Notes Indenture will require the
transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions, and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes
payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(a) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior Notes;

(b) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(c) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(d) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer, Excess Proceeds Offer or Notes Offer.

The Senior Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer under or with respect to the Senior Notes or any
of the Senior Notes Guarantors with respect to any Senior Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior
Notes Guarantor is then incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident
for tax purposes or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction
from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes
Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any paying agent for the Senior Notes) or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein (each, a “Tax Jurisdiction”) will at any time be required to be made
from any payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer under or with respect to the Senior Notes or
any of the Senior Notes Guarantors with respect to any Senior Note Guarantee, including, without limitation,
payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior
Notes Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder of Senior Notes
after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from
such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received by the holder in
respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no
Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any
actual or deemed present or former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Notes
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over,
the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been a resident,
citizen or national of such jurisdiction or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business there or
having or having had a permanent establishment therein for Tax purposes), but excluding any connection arising
merely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or
under a Senior Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Senior Note
Guarantee;

(b) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available
for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30- day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes, or excise taxes
imposed on the transfer of Senior Notes;

(d) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be
made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions
of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law
implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive;

(e) Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Senior
Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to
another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(f) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with
respect to, the Senior Notes or with respect to any Senior Note Guarantee;

(g) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the
holder or beneficial owner of Senior Notes, following the Senior Notes Issuer’s written request addressed to the
holder or beneficial owner (and made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting
reasonably to comply with that request), to comply with any certification, identification, information or other
reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax
Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes
imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner

271


-----

is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is
legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(h) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Senior Notes Issuer or Senior
Notes Guarantor to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole
beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had
such holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Note;

(i) any Taxes payable under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not
materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof and
any agreements (including any intergovernmental agreements) entered into pursuant thereto; or

(j) any combination of items (a) through (i) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors will also pay and
indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any
other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable
expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance, initial
resale, enforcement or registration of any of the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, any Senior Note
Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of Senior Notes other than the initial
resale by the relevant initial purchasers), or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in
the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in
a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a) through (e) or (g) through (i) above or any
combination thereof), or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or
in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Senior Notes or any Senior Note Guarantee.

If the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be
obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Senior Notes or
any Senior Note Guarantee, each of the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor, as the case
may be, will deliver to the Senior Notes Trustee (copied to the Paying Agent) on a date that is at least 30 days
prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior
to that payment date, in which case the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor shall notify
the Senior Notes Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts
will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate(s) must also set forth any
other information reasonably necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders
on the relevant payment date. The Senior Notes Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings
and deductions required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Senior Notes Issuer or the
relevant Senior Notes Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority
evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior
Notes Guarantor will furnish to the Senior Notes Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of
any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Senior
Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to
obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Senior
Notes Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably requested by the Senior Notes Trustee or the Paying Agent, the
Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Guarantors will provide to the Senior Notes Trustee or Paying Agent
such information as may be in the possession of the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Guarantors (and not
otherwise in the possession of the Senior Notes Trustee or the Paying Agent) to enable the Senior Notes Trustee
or the Paying Agent to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder;
_provided, however, that in no event shall the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Guarantors be required to_
disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the Senior Notes Trustee or the Paying Agent be required to determine the amount of withholding taxes
attributable to any particular holder.

Whenever in the Senior Notes Indenture or in this “Description of the Senior Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Senior Notes or of principal,
redemption or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior Notes, interest or of

272


-----

any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Senior Notes or any Senior Note Guarantee, such
mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture, any
transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Senior Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction
in which any successor Person to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor is incorporated,
organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from
or through which such Person makes any payment on the Senior Notes (or any Senior Note Guarantee) and any
department or political subdivision thereof or therein.

**The Senior Note Guarantees**

The Senior Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis under the Senior Notes Indenture by Cerba
European Lab S.A.S. (the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer” or the “Company”), Cefid SA, Cerba Selafa, CBM,
SLB, BARC, CRI, LBS and LLAM S.A. on the Completion Date (the “Completion Date Senior Notes
_Guarantors”), and by Biolille Société d’Exercice Libéral de Directeurs et Directeurs Adjoints en Laboratoire_
d’Analyse de Biologie Médicale, Bioréunion, Biotop Développement and Centre Biologique du Chemin Vert
(collectively, the “Post Completion Date Senior Notes Guarantors”, and together with the Completion Date
Senior Notes Guarantors, the “Initial Senior Notes Guarantors”) within thirty days of the Completion Date. The
Senior Note Guarantees will be joint and several senior subordinated obligations of the Senior Notes
Guarantors.

The Senior Notes Guarantees will be senior subordinated indebtedness of the Senior Notes Guarantors, which
means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior
Note Guarantees rank behind, and are expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Debt of the
Senior Notes Guarantors, including any obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured
Notes and any other indebtedness ranking pari passu therewith incurred after the Completion Date. The ability
to take enforcement action against the Senior Notes Guarantors is subject to significant restrictions imposed by
the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the
Completion Date. In addition, the Senior Note Guarantees and the collateral securing the Senior Notes and
Senior Note Guarantees are subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, certain
enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured
creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Debt of the
Senior Notes Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Senior Notes recover in
any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets,
or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Senior Notes after the repayment in full of all
Senior Debt.

Each of the Senior Note Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be contractually limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Senior Notes Guarantor without rendering its guarantee
voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or otherwise to reflect applicable
laws, including laws relating to capital maintenance, corporate benefit and the liability of directors and officers.
By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligations under its Senior Note Guarantee or any security interest
granted by such Senior Notes Guarantor, as applicable, could be significantly less than amounts payable in
respect of the Senior Notes. Other debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor may not be similarly limited. In
particular, due to restrictions under French law, the Senior Notes Guarantees of the Post-Completion Date
Senior Notes Guarantors will effectively have no monetary value as none of them will be lent any of the
proceeds of the Offering of the Senior Notes. See “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure”
and “Risk Factors—The Note Guarantees and the Security Interest over the Collateral may be limited by
_applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and_
_enforceability.”_

The operations of the Senior Notes Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore the Senior Notes
Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations (including cash flow generated by the
Proceeds Loans), including its obligations under the Senior Notes. Not all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s
Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of
payment to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of
the Senior Notes Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes
Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s

273


-----

liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Senior Notes to participate in those
assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the
extent that the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the
non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor,
as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the nonguarantor Subsidiary. See “Risk Factors—Additional Risks Related to the Senior Notes—The Senior Notes are
_structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.”_

**_Release of the Senior Note Guarantees_**

The Senior Note Guarantees will be released:

(a) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of that Senior Notes Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a
Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets” below;_

(b) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Senior Notes
Guarantor or any parent company of that Senior Notes Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after
giving effect to such transaction) the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain
_Assets” below and the Senior Notes Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale,_
transfer or other disposition;

(c) with respect to the Senior Note Guarantee of any Senior Notes Guarantor that was required to
provide such Senior Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees” upon such Senior Notes Guarantor being unconditionally released and_
discharged from its liability with respect to the Debt giving rise to the requirement to provide such Senior Note
Guarantee so long as no other Debt guaranteed by the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor would result in the
requirement that such Senior Notes Guarantor provide a Senior Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant
described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” immediately after the release of
such Senior Note Guarantee;

(d) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer
under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes;

(e) in accordance with the caption entitled “—Amendments and Waivers;”

(f) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption entitled “—
_Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets;”_

(g) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes
Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Senior Notes
_Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”_

(h) upon the sale of all the Capital Stock of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, that Senior
Notes Guarantor or any direct or indirect parent of that Senior Notes Guarantor pursuant to a security
enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
and

(i) if the Senior Notes Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Senior Notes
Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Notes
Indenture.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release as specified above, the Senior Notes Trustee and the Security
Agent will execute any documents reasonably requested in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge
and termination in respect of such guarantee. Neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any Senior Notes Guarantor
will be required to make a notation on the Senior Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

274


-----

**The Proceeds Loans**

On the Completion Date, the Senior Notes Issuer lent, pursuant to a proceeds loan in the aggregate principal
amount of €145 million (the “Luxco Proceeds Loan”), the proceeds of the Senior Notes sold in this Offering to
Luxco, and Luxco lent, pursuant to a proceeds loan in an equivalent aggregate principal amount (the “Company
_Proceeds Loan”, and together with the Luxco Proceeds Loan, the “Proceeds Loans”), such proceeds to the_
Company. On the Completion Date, a subsidiary of the Company used the proceeds received by the Company
under the Company Proceeds Loan, together with the proceeds of the offering of additional Senior Secured
Notes by the Company and cash on hand, to effect the Acquisition. See “The Acquisition.”

The Company Proceeds Loan will be treated as an “Issuer Proceeds Loan” for purposes of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and, accordingly, the Company will be allowed to make interest payments of interest on the
Company Proceeds Loan pursuant to Section 4.07(c)(17)(i) of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

It is anticipated that funds received by Luxco under the Company Proceeds Loan as payments of interest, and in
turn received by the Senior Notes Issuer as payments of interest under the Luxco Proceeds Loan, will be used to
service the interest payments under the Senior Notes. In addition, Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer may
upstream further funds as needed by means of dividends or loans.

The Company Proceeds Loan will be treated as a “Subordinated Liability” for purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement and will therefore be subordinated in right of payment to the Revolving Credit Facility and the
Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**Security**

**_General_**

As of the Completion Date, the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes and the obligations
of the Senior Notes Guarantors under their respective Senior Note Guarantees are secured by the following
properties and assets of the Senior Notes Issuer:

(a) a second-ranking security interest in the Capital Stock of Luxco; and

(b) a second-ranking security interest over the Luxco Proceeds Loan.

The assets and property of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries that are from time to time subject to, or
required to be subject to, a Lien pursuant to the Security Documents are referred to as the “Senior Notes
_Collateral.” The security and other agreements in respect of the Senior Notes Collateral are referred to as the_
“Security Documents.”

The Senior Notes Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law, including
laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally, or other restrictions applicable to security providers, including laws relating to capital maintenance,
corporate benefit and the liability of directors and officers.

The Liens securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees will also secure, on a first-priority basis,
the obligations of the Senior Notes Guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior
Secured Notes and certain hedging obligations. The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the
Senior Notes Collateral that are created by the Security Documents as between (a) the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, (c) the counterparties
under certain Hedging Obligations, and (d) the Senior Notes Trustee, certain other creditor representatives, the
Security Agent and the Holders of the Senior Notes, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, which provides, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Senior Secured Notes, and certain Hedging Obligations are secured by first-priority security interests and that
the Senior Notes will be secured by second-priority security interests over the Senior Notes Collateral.
Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the obligations of the Senior Notes
Guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging
obligations will be entitled to receive payment from the proceeds of enforcement of the Security Documents
prior to the Senior Notes Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes. The rights of the Security
Agent (acting on its behalf or on behalf of the holders of the Senior Notes) to take enforcement action under the
Security Documents in respect of the Senior Notes Collateral are subject to certain standstill provisions and
other limitations on enforcement pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, under the

275


-----

Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to incur certain
additional Debt in the future that may share in the Senior Notes Collateral, including Debt secured by the Senior
Notes Collateral on a first-priority basis. The amount of such additional Debt will be limited by the covenants
described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Debt.” Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Debt that may share in the_
Senior Notes Collateral could be significant.

Under the Security Documents, the Senior Notes Collateral will be pledged by the Senior Notes Issuer to secure
the payment when due of the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Notes Guarantors’, as applicable, payment
obligations under the Senior Notes, the Senior Note Guarantees and the Senior Notes Indenture. The Security
Documents will be entered into by, inter alios, the Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as Security
Agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the trustee and the holders of Senior
Secured Notes, certain secured hedge counterparties, and for the Senior Notes Trustee and the holders of Senior
Notes.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests, the relevant Security Documents will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of
the Security Agent, and the security interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt (and not the Debt
under the Senior Notes, the Senior Note Guarantees and the other secured obligations). The parallel debt
construct has not been fully tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes—In certain jurisdictions, security over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather_
_than directly to the holder of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be_
_restricted by local law.”_

Each holder of Senior Notes, by accepting a Senior Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized the Senior
Notes Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agent to enter into the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of Senior Notes, by
accepting a Senior Note, appoints the Senior Notes Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its
agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and authorizes it to act as such.

The holders of the Senior Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore holders may not,
individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security
Documents. The holders may only act through the Senior Notes Trustee or the Security Agent (as creditor of the
parallel debt, in respect of any Security Documents governed by French law), as applicable. The Security Agent
will agree to any release of the security interests created by the Security Documents (the “Security Interests”)
that is in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any
consent of the holders. The Senior Notes Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence
enforcement action under the Security Documents in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture and the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Manner of
_Enforcement of Transaction Security.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Senior Notes Collateral,
the Senior Notes Issuer will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Senior
Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees, to freely operate the Senior Notes
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of
the Senior Notes Collateral, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any
and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting
from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or
dissimilar to the foregoing).

The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees may not be
sufficient to satisfy the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Notes Guarantors’ obligations under the Senior
Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, respectively, and the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes
and the Senior Note Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance
of Additional Senior Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Senior Notes Collateral, subject to the
terms of the Senior Notes Indenture. Please see “Risk Factors—Additional Risks Related to the Senior Notes—
_The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_
_obligations under the Senior Notes and such Senior Notes Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_
_circumstances.”_

276


-----

No appraisals of the Senior Notes Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer or
the Senior Notes Guarantors in connection with this Offering. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of
any sale of the Senior Notes Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to
satisfy amounts due on the Senior Notes or the Senior Note Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the Senior
Notes Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that the Senior Notes Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all. Please see “Risk
_Factors—Additional Risks Related to the Senior Notes—The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the_
_Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes and such Senior Notes_
_Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

The Security Documents are governed by the laws of Luxembourg and provide that the rights with respect to the
Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent and in respect of the
entire outstanding amount of the Senior Notes. The term “Security Interests” refers to the Liens on the Senior
Notes Collateral.

The Senior Notes Issuer shall, and shall procure that each of its Subsidiaries shall, at their own expense, execute
and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may require (i) for registering
any Security Document relating to the Senior Notes Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or
protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Document relating to the Senior Notes
Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes
Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, for facilitating the realization of all
or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating the exercise of all
powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of the Senior
Notes Collateral. The Senior Notes Issuer shall, and shall procure that each of its Subsidiaries shall, execute
such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its
nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may request.

**_Release of the security_**

The Senior Notes Collateral will be released from the Liens over such Senior Notes Collateral under any one or
more of the following circumstances:

(a) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such
property or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Senior Notes
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets” below;

(b) in the case of a Senior Notes Guarantor that is released from its Senior Note Guarantee
pursuant to the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of
such Senior Notes Guarantor;

(c) upon a release of the Lien (the “Initial Lien”) that resulted in the creation of the Lien (the
“Notes Lien”) under the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens” so long as immediately after the release of the Notes Lien there is no other Debt secured by a Lien on the_
property and assets that was the subject of the Initial Lien and Notes Lien that would result in the requirement
for the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to (or
junior in respect of certain obligations that are granted priority in accordance with clauses (b) and (c) of the
definition of “Permitted Collateral Liens”), such Lien;

(d) upon the full and final payment and performance of all financial obligations of the Senior
Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes;

(e) in accordance with the caption entitled “—Amendments and Waivers;”

(f) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes
Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Senior Notes
_Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”_

(g) in the case of a security enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the release of the property and assets subject to such enforcement sale;

277


-----

(h) in respect of a release followed by an immediate retaking in accordance with the further
proviso in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest;”

(i) if the Senior Notes Issuer designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the release of the
property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(j) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in “—Certain Covenants—
_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.”_

Following written request by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and, if necessary, the Senior Notes
Trustee will take all necessary action required to effect any release of Senior Notes Collateral securing the
Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each
of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or any
action on the part of the Senior Notes Trustee.

**Optional Redemption**

**_Optional Redemption of Senior Notes prior to February 1, 2016, upon Equity Offering_**

At any time prior to February 1, 2016, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ written notice to holders of
the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes issued under the Senior Notes Indenture at a redemption price equal to
108.25% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes being redeemed, in each case plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the rights of
holders of the Senior Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date),
with the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings. The Senior Notes Issuer may only do this,
however, if:

(a) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes issued under the Senior
Notes Indenture (excluding Senior Notes held by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries) would
remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such proposed redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion thereof, and any such
redemption or notice may, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the related Equity Offering, with such conditions
precedent being stated in the notice to the holders of the Senior Notes.

**_Optional Redemption of Senior Notes prior to February 1, 2016_**

At any time prior to February 1, 2016, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ written notice to holders of
the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or part of the Senior
Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Redemption
Premium of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to, but not including, the
redemption date. Any such redemption or notice may, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one
or more conditions precedent, with such conditions precedent being stated in the notice to the holders of the
Senior Notes.

**_Optional Redemption of Senior Notes on or after February 1, 2016_**

At any time on or after February 1, 2016, and prior to maturity, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
written notice to holders of the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem
all or part of the Senior Notes. These redemptions will be in amounts of €100,000 or integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of their principal amount
at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, if redeemed
during the 12-month period commencing on February 1 of the years set forth below. This redemption is subject
to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record date that is prior to the redemption date to receive
interest due on an interest payment date.

Unless the Senior Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on
the Senior Notes or portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. Any such
redemption or notice may, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent.

**_Tax Redemption_**

The Senior Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole but not in part, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s
discretion at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the holders of
the Senior Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Senior Notes
Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will
become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of
holders of the Senior Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be
payable in respect of the Senior Notes or any Senior Note Guarantee, the Senior Notes Issuer under or with
respect to the Senior Notes or any of the Senior Notes Guarantors with respect to any Senior Note Guarantee, as
the case may be, is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant Senior
Notes Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid by the Senior Notes Issuer or another Senior Notes
Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Senior Notes
Issuer or Senior Notes Guarantor, as applicable, cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable
measures available (including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction), and the
requirement arises as a result of:

(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the
applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date); or

(b) any amendment to, or change in, any existing official written interpretation or application of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not
been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date
(or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date)
(each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”).

The Senior Notes Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest
date on which the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make
such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Senior Notes was then due, and the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where
relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Senior Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Notes
Issuer will deliver to the Senior Notes Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel
to be subject to the prior written approval of the Senior Notes Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld)) to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Senior Notes
Issuer to redeem the Senior Notes pursuant to the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture. In addition, before the
Senior Notes Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Senior Notes as described above, it will
deliver to the Senior Notes Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay
Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and that it is entitled to redeem such Senior
Notes pursuant to the their terms.

The Senior Notes Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of
counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above,
in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Senior Notes.

279


-----

The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Senior Notes Guarantor only after such Senior Notes Guarantor has
become obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor
Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in
Tax Law occurring on or after the date on which such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Notes
Indenture.

**Sinking Fund; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Senior Notes Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Senior Notes Issuer may be required to
offer to purchase the Senior Notes as described under the captions “—Purchase of Senior Notes upon a Change
_of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets.” The Senior Notes Issuer and any_
Restricted Subsidiary may at any time and from time to time purchase Senior Notes in the open market or
otherwise.

**Purchase of Senior Notes upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs at any time, then the Senior Notes Issuer must make an offer (a
“Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of Senior Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder’s Senior Notes, at a purchase price (the “Change
_of Control Purchase Price”) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued_
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”)
(subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant regular record dates that are prior to the Change of Control
Purchase Date to receive interest due on an interest payment date). Purchases made under a Change of Control
Offer will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture.

Unless the Senior Notes Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Notes in
accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived,
within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver a notice to each holder of
the Senior Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the
procedures described under “—Selection and Notice,” stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and
offering to repurchase Senior Notes on the Change of Control Purchase Date, and the notice will state:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase the
Senior Notes on the date specified in the notice;

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding the transaction or
transactions that constitute a Change of Control;

(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be
a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later
date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or
regulations;

(d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not
paid;

(e) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(f) any other procedures that a holder of Senior Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control
Offer or to withdraw such acceptance.

An agent of the Senior Notes Issuer (expected to be the Paying Agent) will at the written direction of the Senior
Notes Issuer promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Senior Notes properly tendered the
Change of Control Purchase Price for such Senior Notes. The Senior Notes Trustee (or the authenticating agent
appointed by it) will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder
a new Senior Note or Senior Notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Senior Notes
surrendered, if any, to the holder of Senior Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated Senior Notes;
_provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in_
excess thereof. The Senior Notes Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as
soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

280


-----

The ability of the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase Senior Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a Change of
Control could trigger a mandatory repayment and cancellation of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or
require that the Company make an offer to redeem the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Senior Notes
Indenture. The Senior Notes Issuer’s future indebtedness and the future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may
also require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the
holders of the Senior Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Senior Notes upon a Change of Control
could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible
financial effect on the Senior Notes Issuer of such repurchase.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Senior Notes Issuer cannot provide any assurance that it will have
available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Senior Notes that might be
delivered by holders of the Senior Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. If the Senior Notes
Issuer fails to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the Change of Control Purchase Price
when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Senior Notes Trustee and the
holders of the Senior Notes the rights described under “—Events of Default.”

Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer
and its subsidiaries may prohibit the prepayment of the Senior Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the
Senior Notes Issuer was so prohibited from conducting a Change of Control Offer and not able to prepay any
indebtedness containing any such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the Senior Notes Issuer would be
unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations to holders of the Senior Notes who exercise their right to redeem their
Senior Notes following a Change of Control, which would cause a Default or Event of Default under the Senior
Notes Indenture. A Default or Event of Default under the Senior Notes Indenture, unless waived by holders of
the Senior Notes, could result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under
“Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult
or discourage a sale or takeover of the Senior Notes Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management.
The Senior Notes Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control,
although it is possible that the Senior Notes Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to limitations
discussed below, the Senior Notes Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
Senior Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect
the Senior Notes Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to
incur additional Debt are contained in the covenants described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Debt” and “—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a_
majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding (subject to the provisions described under “—
_Amendments and Waivers”). Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the provisions of_
the Senior Notes Indenture will not require the Senior Notes Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer in the
event of certain highly leveraged transactions, or certain other transactions, including a reorganization,
restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect holders of the Senior Notes, if such
transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control.

The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if (1) a third party makes the
Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth
in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and
purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a
notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture as described above under the
caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption
price. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions
of the Senior Notes Indenture are applicable.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive
agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the requirements of applicable tender offer rules, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with

281


-----

a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture by
virtue of such conflict.

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) the Senior Notes Issuer becomes aware of (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) any “person” or “group” of related
persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date),
other than one or more Permitted Holders, is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and
13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the
total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer (or any successor entity permitted by the
covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”);
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause, (x) no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of_
the Senior Notes Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent and (y) any Voting Stock of which any
Permitted Holder is the “beneficial owner” (as so defined) shall not be included in any Voting Stock of which
any such person or group is the “beneficial owner” (as so defined), unless that person or group is not an affiliate
of a Permitted Holder and has the sole voting power with respect to that Voting Stock;

(b) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way
of merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to
a Person, other than or one or more Permitted Holders; or

282


-----

(c) the Senior Notes Issuer is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or dissolution
other than in a transaction that complies with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.”_

The provisions under the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the
consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes.

If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will publish notices relating to a Change of Control Offer on
the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of a Person.

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all the Senior Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Senior Notes Trustee or the Registrar will
select the Senior Notes for redemption by a method that complies with the requirements, as certified to the
Senior Notes Trustee and the Registrar by the Senior Notes Issuer, of the principal securities exchange, if any,
on which the Senior Notes are listed at such time or, if the Senior Notes are not listed on a securities exchange,
_pro rata or by such other method as the Senior Notes Trustee or the Registrar in its sole discretion shall deem_
fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by law; provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall
reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Note not redeemed to less than €100,000. Neither the Senior
Notes Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

No Senior Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class
mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Senior Notes to be
redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion
of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. While the Senior Notes are held in certificated form,
a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name
of the holder of Senior Notes upon cancellation of the original Senior Note. Senior Notes called for redemption
become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on
Senior Notes or portions of Senior Notes redeemed.

For Senior Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to
entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Senior Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of that
exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the
holders of the relevant Senior Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by
such rules and regulations, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu)
and, in connection with any redemption, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of
any change in the principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding.

Notice of any redemption including, without limitation, upon an Equity Offering may, at the Senior Notes
Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of
the related Equity Offering. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
the related notice shall describe each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Senior Notes
Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall such date of redemption be delayed to a date later than
60 days after the date on which such notice was sent), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be

283


-----

rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption
date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Notes attain an Investment Grade Rating from both of the
Rating Agencies and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior Notes
Indenture (a “Suspension Event”), beginning on the day of the Suspension Event and continuing until such time
(the “Suspension Period”), if any, at which the Senior Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Rating from
each Rating Agency (the “Reversion Date”), the covenants summarized under the following captions will not
apply to the Senior Notes and any related default provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture will cease to be
effective and will not be applicable to the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt;”

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates;”

(4) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets;”

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees;”

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
_Subsidiaries;”_

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries;” and

(8) “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” (but only clause (c) of the first
paragraph of such covenant).

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms on and after the
Reversion Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Senior Notes
Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the Suspension Period, and the “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it had been in effect since the_
Issue Date, except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment
made during the Suspension Period. On the Reversion Date, all Debt incurred during the continuance of the
Suspension Period will be classified as having been incurred pursuant to clause (2)(d) of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt.” Any transactions prohibited by the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates” entered into after such reinstatement
pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to
clause (c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Transactions with Affiliates.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take_
any action described in clauses (a) through (d) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that_
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (2)(c) of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions
_Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.” No Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer shall be required to comply with_
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” after such reinstatement with
respect to any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period. Upon the occurrence of
a Suspension Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the Senior Notes Issuer will send written notice to the Senior Notes
Trustee.

Debt); provided, however, the Senior Notes Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to
incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if, after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and the application of
the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Senior Notes
Issuer for the four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the
incurrence of such Debt, taken as one period, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; provided, further, that the
aggregate amount of Debt (including Acquired Debt) that may be incurred pursuant to the foregoing by a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Notes Guarantor shall not exceed €20.0 million, at any one time

Debt and the payee is not the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor, such Debt is unsecured
and expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the
Senior Notes, in the case of the Senior Notes Issuer, or the Senior Note Guarantee, in the case of a
Senior Notes Guarantor (including as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) (A) except in respect of Working Capital Intercompany Loans and (B) only to
the extent legally permitted (the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed
all procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to
protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination
of such Debt); and

(ii) (A) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to a Person (other than a
disposition, pledge or transfer to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and (B) any
transaction pursuant to which any Restricted Subsidiary that has Debt owing by the Senior Notes Issuer
or another Restricted Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, will, in each case, be deemed to
be an incurrence of such Debt not permitted by this clause (c);

(d) any Debt of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt described in
clauses (a) and (b) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the Transactions
(including, without limitation, any Senior Secured Notes issued by the Company on the Issue Date after giving
effect to the Transactions and any related guarantees);

(e) guarantees of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary by the

Senior Notes or to a Senior Note Guarantee then such guarantee must be subordinated to the same extent as the
Debt being guaranteed;

similar credit support given by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt incurred by any
Person acquiring all or any portion of such assets for the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided that the
maximum aggregate liability in respect of all such Debt permitted pursuant to this clause (f) will at no time

outstanding, will not exceed the greater of €35.0 million and 3.5% of Total Assets; provided, that the aggregate
amount of Debt that may be incurred pursuant to the foregoing by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior

Notes Issuer could incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt under clause (1) of this covenant after giving pro

(including, in the case of (2)(d), any Debt that renews, refunds, replaces (whether upon or after termination or
otherwise) or refinances any such Debt that has been repaid, prepaid, purchased, repurchased, redeemed,
defeased or otherwise extinguished, in whole or in part), (2)(l) or this (2)(m) of this covenant, as the case may
be;

(n) Contribution Debt;

(o) the incurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt represented by
guarantees of any Management Advances;

equipment used in a Permitted Business of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, whether
through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Debt
incurred to renew, refund, replace, refinance, defease or discharge any Debt incurred pursuant to this clause (q)
in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (A) €30.0 million and (B) 3.0% of Total Assets.

(3) Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Debt, the payment of dividends on
Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital Stock in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Redeemable
Capital Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Debt due to a change in IFRS
will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Debt for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining
compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Debt in euro where Debt is denominated in a different
currency, the amount of such Debt will be the Euro Equivalent determined on the date of such determination;
_provided that if any such Debt denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with_
respect to euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in euro
will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such Currency Agreement. The principal amount of any
refinancing Debt incurred in the same currency as the Debt being refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the
Debt refinanced determined on the date such Debt being refinanced was initially incurred, except to the extent
that such Euro Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Agreement (with respect to euro), in which case,
the amount of such refinancing Debt will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such Currency
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with
this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of
currencies or currency values will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the Senior Notes Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary may incur under the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(4) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant
(a) obligations with respect to letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Debt otherwise
included in the determination of such particular amount will not be included and (b) any Liens granted pursuant
to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” covenant will
not be treated as Debt.

(5) For the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” under clause (2)(a)(ii) of this covenant, pro
_forma effect shall be given to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Fixed_
Charge Coverage Ratio of the Senior Notes Issuer and Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured as at the time
that the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Guarantor obtains new commitments (in the case of revolving
facilities) or incurs new Indebtedness (in the case of term facilities).

(6) The amount of any Debt outstanding as of any date will be:

(a) in the case of any Debt issued with original issue discount, the accreted value of such Debt
and in the case of pay-in-kind Debt, the amount of such Debt shall include any interest paid in the form of
additional Debt;

(b) the principal amount of the Debt or the liquidation preference thereof, as applicable, in the
case of any other Debt determined in accordance with IFRS; and

287


-----

(c) in respect of Debt of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person,
the lesser of:

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Debt of the other Person.

(7) If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Debt of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Debt is not permitted to
be incurred as of such date under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Restricted Subsidiary shall be in
Default of this covenant).

(8) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Debt described in
clauses (2)(a) through (q) of this covenant or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to clause (1) of this “—
_Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify items_
of Debt on the date of its incurrence and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Debt in
one of such clauses or paragraphs, and the Senior Notes Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of
Debt in more than one of the types of Debt described in clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant, and may change the
classification of an item of Debt (or any portion thereof) to any other type of Debt described in this “—
_Limitation on Debt” covenant at any time; provided that Debt incurred pursuant to clause (2)(a) above may not_
be reclassified. Debt under the Revolving Credit Facility incurred or outstanding on the Issue Date will be
deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance of the exception provided in clause (2)(a) above.

(9) In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or Luxco incurs Debt owing to any Parent Company of the
Senior Notes Issuer or other Affiliates of any Parent Company of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than
Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer) which, together with all other such outstanding Debt incurred prior to
such incurrence, including (notwithstanding clause (3) of this covenant) any accrued or capitalized interest
thereon, is in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than €10.0 million, the Senior Notes Issuer shall
(reasonably promptly after such incurrence) procure that any such Debt (including, without limitation, any
Frenchco CPECs then outstanding) is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of the
Senior Notes pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Restricted Subsidiary would have received on such pro rata basis;

conversion; (iv) the assumption by the purchaser of any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Senior
Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt), that are assumed by the transferee of

295


-----

Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value) the greater of €15.0 million and 1.50% of Total Assets; or (ix) a combination of

(2) If the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash
Proceeds from such Asset Sale, within 400 days after the consummation of such Asset Sale, may be used or
committed in a binding commitment to be used (provided that such Net Cash Proceeds are actually used within
the later of 400 days from the consummation of the Asset Sale or 180 days from the date of such binding
commitment) at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) to purchase the Senior Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of the Senior Notes at a
purchase price equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (a “Senior Notes
_Offer”);_

(b) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay any Debt under Credit Facilities
(provided that in connection with any revolving credit borrowings under Credit Facilities, the related
commitment will not be required to be cancelled) incurred pursuant to clause 2(a) of the covenant described
under the caption “—Limitation on Debt”;

(c) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay any other Senior Debt or other Debt
that is secured by a Lien on assets or property which do not constitute Senior Notes Collateral (provided, in each
case, that in connection with any revolving credit borrowings under Credit Facilities, the related commitment
will not be required to be reduced) or (ii) any Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Notes
Guarantor;

(d) unless included in clause (2)(b) or (2)(c) above, to purchase, or prepay or redeem or repay,
any Pari Passu Debt at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such
Debt or a price equal to the same percentage of principal amount that is offered to the holders of Senior Notes in
the substantially concurrent pro rata offer made to them, so long as the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary makes an offer on a pro rata basis to all holders of the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to at
least 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional
Amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase;

(e) to acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(f) to make a capital expenditure;

(g) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) that are used or useful in a Permitted
Business; or

(h) any combination of the foregoing.

(3) Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds (including cash or Cash Equivalents received
from the conversion of any securities, notes or other obligations), the Senior Notes Issuer (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash
Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture.

(4) Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in clause (2) of
this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” The Senior Notes Issuer may also at any time, and the Senior
Notes Issuer will within ten Business Days after the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
€15.0 million, make an offer (an “Excess Proceeds Offer”) to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of
sales of assets the maximum principal amount of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Debt, to the extent required by the
terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture or
the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt. The offer price for the Senior Notes and any such Pari
Passu Debt will be payable in cash in an amount equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of such Note
(and solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt, no greater than either 100% of the principal amount (or accreted
value, as applicable) of such Debt or the same percentage of principal amount that is offered to the holders of
Senior Notes in the substantially concurrent pro rata offer made to them), plus in each case accrued and unpaid

296


-----

interest, if any, to the date of purchase and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or
redemption.

(5) To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt
tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Senior
Notes Issuer (or applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to
purchase the Senior Notes and other Pari Passu Debt for general corporate purposes that are not otherwise
prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and any such
Pari Passu Debt to be prepaid or validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Senior Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased will be purchased,
prepaid or redeemed, as applicable, on a pro rata basis (based upon the principal amount of the Senior Notes
and the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt to be prepaid or tendered by each holder).
Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero. If
the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to be purchased exceeds the amount of proceeds received for
application to such principal amount, the Senior Notes Trustee will select the Senior Notes to be purchased on a
_pro rata basis (or in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice”), based on the amounts tendered._

(6) If the Senior Notes Issuer is obligated to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Senior Notes Issuer will
purchase the Senior Notes and Pari Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in
integral multiples of €1,000, on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the
notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such holders, or such later date as may be required under the
Exchange Act; provided that no Note of less than €100,000 remains outstanding thereafter.

(7) The Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those law and regulations
are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the
Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached their respective obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the
Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Senior Notes Guarantor,
directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of any other Debt of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes
Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to
the Senior Notes Indenture providing for a Senior Note Guarantee of the payment of the Senior Notes by such
Restricted Subsidiary, which Senior Note Guarantee will be pari passu with or senior (or, if the other Debt
being guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary is Senior Debt, junior) to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee
of such other Debt.

Each additional Senior Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary
(a) existing on the Issue Date, (b) that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the
guarantee was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary, (c) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of
not less than €250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A or the
equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody’s, in connection with the
operation of cash management programs established for the benefit of the Senior Notes Issuer or the Restricted
Subsidiaries, or (d), for the avoidance of doubt, arising due to the granting of a Permitted Lien or Permitted
Collateral Lien.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer shall not be obligated to cause a Restricted Subsidiary to
guarantee the payment of the Senior Notes to the extent that such Senior Note Guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (a) a violation of applicable law, which, in
any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Senior Notes
Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary; (b) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted

297


-----

Subsidiary; or (c) significant cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other
than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than reasonably expenses incurred in connection with any
governmental or regulatory filings required as a result or, or any measures pursuant to clause (b) undertaken in
connection with, such Senior Note Guarantee, which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available
to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its
Capital Stock to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or
participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Senior Notes Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Senior Notes Issuer or any other Restricted
Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary to other Debt incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, shall not be deemed
to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(2) The provisions of the covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to encumbrances or
restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(a) the Senior Notes (including Additional Senior Notes), the Senior Note Guarantees, the Senior
Notes Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes or any related guarantees,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents;

(b) any agreements or instruments with respect to Debt of the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of “—
_Limitation on Debt,” and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,_
replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that such encumbrances or restrictions taken as a
whole, as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior management of the Senior
Notes Issuer, are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Senior Notes than (i) the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date, (ii) is customary in
comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior
management), or (iii) the Senior Notes Issuer determines at the time such Debt is incurred that such
encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Senior Notes Issuers’ ability
to make principal or interest payments on the Senior Notes (as determined in good faith by the board of directors
or a member of senior management);

(c) any agreement in effect on the Issue Date after giving effect to the Transactions and any
amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of
those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to
such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date, after
giving effect to the Transactions (as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior
management of the Senior Notes Issuer);

(d) customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases and licenses entered into
in the ordinary course of business;

298


-----

(e) any agreement or other instrument of a Person (including its Subsidiaries), acquired by the
Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in effect at the time of such acquisition (but not created in
contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or
assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired (including its
Subsidiaries);

(f) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or substantially all
the property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary
pending its sale or other disposition;

caption “—Limitation on Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), which limitations
are applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements;

(k) Purchase Money Obligations and mortgage financings for property acquired in the ordinary
course of business and Capitalized Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or
leased of the nature described in clause (1)(d) of the preceding paragraph;

(l) any Qualified Securitization Financing;

(m) any agreement that extends, renews, amends, modifies, restates, supplements, refunds,
refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (2)(a)
through (l), or in this clause (2)(m); provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or
restrictions are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the holders of the Senior Notes than those
under or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, amended, modified, restated, supplemented, refunded,
refinanced or replaced;

(n) customary restrictions included in shareholder agreements relating to non-Wholly Owned
Subsidiaries; and

(o) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations.

**_Lines of Business_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other
than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Senior Notes Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The board of directors of the Senior Notes Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing at the time of or after giving
effect to such designation and such Subsidiary to be so designated or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any
Capital Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on any property of, the Senior Notes Issuer or any other
Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer that is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated or otherwise
an Unrestricted Subsidiary. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment
made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the
covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more
clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Senior Notes Issuer. That designation
will only be permitted if the Investment of the Senior Notes Issuer in such Subsidiary would be permitted at that
time under the covenant “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” The board of directors of the Senior Notes
Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not
cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to
the Senior Notes Trustee by filing with the Senior Notes Trustee a copy of a resolution of the board of directors
giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the
preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments.” The board of directors of the Senior Notes Issuer may at any time designate any_
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an
incurrence of Debt by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Debt is permitted under the covenant described under the caption

300


-----

“—Limitation on Debt,” calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of
the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such
designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer as a Restricted Subsidiary
will be evidenced to the Senior Notes Trustee by filing with the Senior Notes Trustee a copy of a resolution of
the board of directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complied with the preceding conditions.

**_Provision of Information_**

So long as the Senior Notes are outstanding, the Senior Notes Issuer will furnish to the Senior Notes Trustee:

301


-----

Notes Issuer or any other material event that the Senior Notes Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a
description of such event.

All historical financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS on a consistent basis for the
periods presented. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for the
Senior Notes Issuer or any Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of
operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum
and in no event (i) shall U.S. GAAP information or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP be required or (ii) such report
shall include separate financial statements for any Senior Notes Guarantor and non-Senior Notes Guarantor
Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Company or the Senior Notes
Issuer will also (i) file a press release with the appropriate internationally recognized wire services (including,
without limitation, through the newswire service of Bloomberg, or if Bloomberg does not then operate, any
similar agency) in connection with such report or (ii) post each such report on such website as may be then
maintained by the Company or the Senior Notes Issuer.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “—
_Provision of Information” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the_
financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

At any time that any of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) are
Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer, then the financial statements, information,
auditors’ reports and other documents or information required to be provided under this “—Provision of
_Information” covenant will be those of the Senior Notes Issuer rather than those of the Company, and any such_
required quarterly and annual financial information will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the
face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of
the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer.

At the Senior Notes Issuer’s election, for any relevant reporting period, the financial statements, information,
auditors’ reports and other documents or information required to be provided as described in the four preceding
paragraphs of this “—Provision of Information” covenant, may be, rather than those of the Company, those of
the Senior Notes Issuer itself. If the Senior Note Guarantee of the Company has been released in accordance
with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the reports and other documents and information required to
be provided as described in the first four paragraphs of this “—Provision of Information” covenant shall be those
of the Senior Notes Issuer. With respect to information and reports for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014
and the quarter ending March 31, 2015, we expect to provide the financial statements, information and other
documents of the Company.

So long as any of the Senior Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Senior Notes
Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, the Senior Notes Issuer will make available to any prospective
purchaser of Senior Notes or beneficial owner of Senior Notes in connection with any sale thereof the
information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

In the event that (i) the Senior Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the Commission or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer elects to provide reports
which, if filed with the Commission, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer) the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it
elects, the Senior Notes Issuer will make available such annual reports, information, documents and other
reports that the Senior Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the Commission pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed
to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs of this covenant.

**_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of related
transactions, consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Senior Notes Issuer is the
surviving Person) or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the
properties or assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one or more
related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(a) at the time of, and immediately after giving effect to, any such transaction or series of
transactions, either (i) the Senior Notes Issuer will be the surviving Person or (ii) the Person (if other than the
Senior Notes Issuer) formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger or to which such sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially all the properties and assets of the
Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis has been made (the “Surviving
_Entity”):_

(x) will be a Person duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union as in effect on December 31, 2003, Switzerland, Canada,
the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

(y) will expressly assume the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior
Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, and (in the event of a merger or consolidation of the Senior Notes Issuer or a sale
of all or substantially all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s assets effected through the sale of the
Capital Stock of Luxco) the Security Documents pursuant to a supplemental indenture,
accession agreement, security documents and any other relevant document, in each case,
delivered to the Senior Notes Trustee and the Security Agent; and

(z) will grant, or cause to be granted, for the benefit of the holders of the Senior
Notes (in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s assets
effected through the sale of the Capital Stock of Holdco or the Company) a second-ranking
security interest in the shares of the Company or the direct Subsidiary of the Surviving Entity
of which the Company is a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma
basis (and treating any obligation of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred in connection
with or as a result of such transaction or series of related transactions as having been incurred by the Senior
Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will
have occurred and be continuing;

(c) the Senior Notes Issuer or the Surviving Entity would, on the date of such transaction after
giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (i) be permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt
pursuant to the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in clause (1) of the “—Limitation on
_Debt” covenant or (ii) have a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not less than it was immediately prior_
to giving effect to such transaction;

(d) the Senior Notes Issuer or the Surviving Entity will have delivered to the Senior Notes
Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Senior Notes Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel,
each stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition,
and if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture,
comply with this covenant and that the supplemental indenture and the Senior Notes constitute the Senior Notes
Issuer’s or Surviving Entity’s legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable (subject to customary
qualifications) in accordance with their terms; and

(e) (i) in the event of a merger or consolidation of the Senior Notes Issuer or a sale of all or
substantially all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s assets effected through the sale of the Capital Stock of Luxco, the
Luxco Proceeds Loan will be novated to the Surviving Entity, or (ii) in the event of a sale of all or substantially
all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s assets effected through the sale of the Capital Stock of Holdco or the Company,
the Company Proceeds Loan will be novated to the Surviving Entity and a second-ranking security interest will
be granted by such entity over such loan for the benefit of the holders of Senior Notes, and such novated Luxco

303


-----

Proceeds Loan or novated Company Proceeds Loan, as applicable, shall constitute a “Proceeds Loan” for the
purposes of this Senior Notes Indenture.

The Surviving Entity will succeed to, be substituted for and may exercise every right and power of the Senior
Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents (with the release of the Senior Notes Issuer from any and
all obligations thereunder); provided that, in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the Senior Notes
Issuer’s assets effected through the sale of the Capital Stock of Holdco or the Company, the Liens over the
Senior Notes Collateral consisting of the Capital Stock of Luxco and the Luxco Proceeds Loan will be released.

A Senior Notes Guarantor (other than any Senior Notes Guarantor whose Senior Note Guarantee is to be
released in accordance with the terms of the Senior Note Guarantee and the Senior Notes Indenture as described
under “—The Senior Note Guarantees”) will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into
another Person (whether or not such Senior Notes Guarantor is the surviving Person), or (2) sell, assign, transfer,
lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of such Senior Notes
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related
transactions, to another Person, unless:

(a) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(b) either:

(i) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed
by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Senior Notes Guarantor) assumes
all the obligations of such Senior Notes Guarantor under its Senior Note Guarantee, the Senior Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents to which such Senior Notes Guarantor is party pursuant to a supplemental indenture,
accession agreement and appropriate security documents delivered to the Senior Notes Trustee and the
Security Agent; or

(ii) the Net Cash Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture.

Notwithstanding clauses (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant and clause (a) of the third paragraph
of this covenant (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence) (i) any Restricted Subsidiary
may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Senior
Notes Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer may consolidate with, merge
into or transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Senior Notes Guarantor. In addition,
clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Senior Notes Issuer with or into an Affiliate
solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Senior Notes Issuer in another jurisdiction for tax reasons.

Notwithstanding clause (a) of the third paragraph of this covenant, any Senior Notes Guarantor may consolidate
or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Senior
Notes Guarantor, and any Senior Notes Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an
Affiliate incorporated or organized solely for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Senior Notes
Guarantor, reincorporating the Senior Notes Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the
Senior Notes Guarantor.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of a Person.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Senior Notes Issuer, will not, and the Senior Notes Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which might or would have the result
of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Senior Notes Collateral (it being understood that
(subject to provisos below) the incurrence of Liens on the Senior Notes Collateral permitted by the definition of
Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest
with respect to the Senior Notes Collateral) for the benefit of the Senior Notes Trustee and the holders of the

304


-----

Senior Notes, and the Senior Notes Issuer will not, and the Senior Notes Issuer will not cause or permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Senior
Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement any interest whatsoever in
any of the Senior Notes Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or
release of the Senior Notes Collateral in accordance with any other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Senior
Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and
_provided further, however, that, except with respect to clause (a) of the foregoing proviso, no Security_
Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or a
Lien over the Senior Notes Collateral released and substantially concurrently retaken unless substantially
concurrently with such amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement
or release and retaking, the Senior Notes Issuer delivers to the Senior Notes Trustee any of (1) a solvency
opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm confirming the solvency of the
Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, (2) a certificate
from the board of directors or the chief financial officer of the relevant Person amending, extending, renewing,
restating, supplementing, modifying, replacing or releasing and retaking such Security Document which
confirms the solvency of such Person after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release and retaking and replacement, or (3) an
opinion of counsel confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Senior Notes
created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified,
replaced, released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection
or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement
or release.

At the written direction of the Senior Notes Issuer and without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes,
the Senior Notes Trustee and the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to
the Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for
Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Senior Notes Collateral; (iv) comply with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; (v) evidence the succession of another Person to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior
Notes Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture, the
Senior Notes, the applicable Senior Note Guarantee and the Security Documents, in each case, in accordance
with “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;” (vi) provide for the release of property
and assets constituting Senior Notes Collateral from the Lien of the Security Documents or the release of the
Senior Note Guarantee of a Senior Notes Guarantor, in each case, in accordance with (and if permitted by) the
terms of the Senior Notes Indenture; (vii) conform the Security Documents to this “Description of the Senior
_Notes;” (viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Senior Notes Trustee or_
Security Agent; (ix) to provide for Additional Senior Notes to also benefit from the Senior Notes Collateral or
(x) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Senior Notes in
any material respect.

In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer complies with this covenant, the Security Agent and the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Senior Notes Trustee, if required, shall take all action necessary to effect such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

At the written request of the Senior Notes Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, the Incurrence or refinancing of any
Senior Debt, the Senior Notes or any Debt that is permitted to share the Senior Notes Collateral, the Senior
Notes Issuer, the relevant Senior Notes Guarantors, the Senior Notes Trustee and the Security Agent will
(without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes) enter into an additional intercreditor agreement (each an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement (or more
favorable to the holders of the Senior Notes) or an amendment to or an amendment and restatement of the
Intercreditor Agreement (which amendment in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer does not
adversely affect the rights of holder of the Senior Notes in any material respect), it being understood that an
increase in the amount of Debt being subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will be deemed to be on substantially similar terms to the Intercreditor Agreement and
will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Senior Notes and will be permitted by this

305


-----

covenant if, in each case, the incurrence of such Debt (and any Lien in its favor) is permitted by the “Limitation
_on Debt” and “Limitation on Liens” covenants; provided that such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional_
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Senior Notes Trustee or the Security
Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, protections, indemnities or immunities of the Senior
Notes Trustee and the Security Agent under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the foregoing and the succeeding
paragraph, any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement may provide for senior, pari passu or subordinated
security interests in respect of any such Debt (to the extent such Indebtedness is permitted to share the Senior
Notes Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted Collateral Lien).

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Senior Notes Issuer and without
the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time
to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of such agreement, (2) increase the
amount or types of Debt covered by such agreement that may be incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior
Notes Guarantor that is subject to such agreement (including with respect to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Debt ranking junior in right of
payment to the Senior Notes or the Senior Note Guarantees, or an amendment or modification of provisions
relating to Debt ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Notes or the Senior Note Guarantees if such
amendments do not adversely affect the holders of the Senior Notes in any material respect, (3) add Restricted
Subsidiaries or new Senior Notes Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Notes (including Additional Senior Notes), (5) make provision for
equal and ratable pledges of or call options on the Senior Notes Collateral to secure Additional Senior Notes,
(6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of the Senior Notes in any material respect.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of
the holders of the Senior Notes to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of Subordinated Debt; provided that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described under the caption “—Restricted Payments.”

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that each holder of a Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to
have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement, Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, and any amendment that complies with the provisions of this covenant and none of the Senior Notes
Issuer, the Senior Notes Trustee or the Security Agent will be required to seek the consent of any holders of the
Senior Notes to perform its obligations under and in accordance with this covenant. Each holder of the Senior
Notes will be deemed to have consented to and directed the Senior Notes Trustee and the Security Agent to
execute the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or amendment or amendment and
restatement of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that complies with the
provisions of this covenant.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the
Senior Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for so long as such Senior Notes are outstanding; provided
that if the Senior Notes Issuer is unable to obtain admission to listing of the Senior Notes on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange or if at any time the Senior Notes Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Senior Notes on another
recognized stock exchange.

**_Holding Company Limitation on Holdco_**

(a) Holdco shall not carry on any material business or own any material assets except for:

(i) subscribing for, holding and voting shares or other debt or equity instruments or
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries, Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries, other credit
balances in bank accounts and any other asset or property substantially in the nature of bank accounts
and other assets or property it owns on the Issue Date after giving effect to the Transactions, and to sell,
issue, convey, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all of the foregoing in each case, in accordance

306


-----

with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture; provided that (notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this covenant) Holdco may from time to time receive in a transaction otherwise
permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture any other properties and assets (including cash and Cash
Equivalents, shares and/or other equity or debt securities, Debt and/or other obligations) for the purpose
of transferring such properties and assets to the direct or indirect holders of its Capital Stock or any of
its Subsidiaries, so long as in any case such further transfer is made reasonably promptly by Holdco
and, after giving effect thereto, Holdco is again in compliance with this clause;

(ii) (A) the issuance, offering and sale of Capital Stock, other equity securities or any
Debt or other debt securities or instruments of Holdco and using the net cash proceeds of such issuance,
or exchanging or converting such securities or instruments for any purposes not prohibited by this
covenant, including, without limitation, to fund the purchase price or redemption of any Debt or other
equity or debt instrument or security of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or contributing to the
common equity of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (B) any purchase, repurchase,
redemption, or the performance of the terms and conditions of, and exercise of rights in respect of, the
foregoing, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture;

relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to,
any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior
Notes, to exclude holders of Senior Notes in any jurisdiction where (a) the solicitation of such consent, waiver

310


-----

or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (b) the payment of the
consideration therefor would require the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a
registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not
limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states),
which the Senior Notes Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (x) would be materially
burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s)
used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or
financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted
under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

any principal amount of the relevant Proceeds Loan (other than to secure the Senior Notes, any Senior Note
Guarantees or the Senior Notes Indenture, to secure the Senior Secured Notes, any related guarantee or the

Notes Indenture (including, without limitation, pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption “—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”) or in connection with a transaction permitted by “—_
_Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”); or (5) amend the relevant Proceeds Loan in a_
manner adverse in any material respect to the Holders of Senior Notes (as determined in good faith by the
Senior Notes Issuer). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer or Luxco may amend the relevant

Notwithstanding the foregoing the Proceeds Loans may be cancelled, forgiven, amended or otherwise repaid,
released or discharged upon:

(1) legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes, as provided in
“—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of the Senior Notes Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge;”_

(2) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;” or

(4) as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of
_Assets.”_

The Senior Notes Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested by the
Senior Notes Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture and the applicable Security Document, to
effectuate any release of the Proceeds Loans in accordance with the foregoing provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Senior Notes
Trustee and the Security Agent without the consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent
on the part of the Senior Notes Trustee or the Security Agent.

dealt with in clause (a) or (b) above);

(d) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor, Holdco or Luxco for
60 days after written notice to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Senior Notes Trustee or the holders of at least 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding voting as a single class to comply with any
of the agreements in the Senior Notes Indenture (other than a default in performance, or breach, or a covenant or
agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (a), (b) or (c) above or the Senior Notes, the Senior Note
Guarantees or the Security Documents);

(e) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing Debt for money borrowed by
the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, if that default (x) results in the acceleration of the payment
of such Debt or (y) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Debt at final maturity thereof after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods, and such failure to make any payment has not been waived or the
maturity of such Debt has not been extended (a “Payment Default”), and in either case the total amount of such
Debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds €20.0 million;

(f) any Senior Note Guarantee ceases to be, is held in any judicial proceeding or shall be asserted
in writing by any Senior Notes Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any Senior Notes Guarantor, not to
be, in full force and effect or enforceable in accordance with its terms (other than as provided for in the Senior
Notes Indenture, any Senior Note Guarantee or the Intercreditor Agreement);

(g) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or a group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments, orders or
decrees (not subject to appeal) entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of
€20.0 million (exclusive of any amounts covered by insurance policies issued by reputable and creditworthy
insurance companies), which judgments shall not have been discharged or waived and there shall have been a
period of 60 consecutive days or more during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, order or decree (by
reason of pending appeal, waiver or otherwise) shall not have been in effect;

(h) (i) the Security Interests purported to be created under any Security Document (with respect to
Senior Notes Collateral) having a Fair Market Value in excess of €5.0 million (other than in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Senior Notes Indenture) will, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect and constitute a valid and
perfected Lien with the priority required by the applicable Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Notes Indenture for any reason other than the satisfaction in
full of all obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture and discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture or in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior
Notes Indenture and the Security Documents or (ii) any Security Interest purported to be created under any
Security Document is declared invalid or unenforceable or the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
granting Senior Notes Collateral that is the subject of any such Security Interest asserts, in any pleading in any
court of competent jurisdiction, that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and such failure to be
in full force and effect or such assertion has continued uncured for a period of 15 days; and

(i) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Senior Notes
Indenture with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that taken as a whole would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

(2) If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (1)(i) above with respect to the Senior Notes
Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Senior Notes Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding by written notice to the Senior Notes Issuer (and to the
Senior Notes Trustee if such notice is given by the holders) may, and the Senior Notes Trustee, upon the written
request of such holders, shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and
accrued interest on all the outstanding Senior Notes immediately due and payable, and upon any such
declaration all such amounts payable in respect of the Senior Notes will become immediately due and payable.

(3) If an Event of Default specified in clause (1)(i) above with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer occurs
and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid
interest on all the outstanding Senior Notes shall become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Senior Notes Trustee or any holder of Senior Notes.

312


-----

(4) The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Senior Notes by written notice to the Senior Notes Trustee may on behalf of the holders of
all of the Senior Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Senior Notes Indenture
(except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, of the
principal of any Senior Notes held by a non-consenting holder, which may only be waived with the consent of
holders of the Senior Notes holding 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes outstanding
under the Senior Notes Indenture) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Senior Notes and its
consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).
In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (e) above, such Event of Default and all consequences
thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Senior Notes) shall
be annulled, waived or rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Senior Notes Trustee or the
holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose:

(i) the indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged;

(ii) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the
case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(iii) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

(5) At any time after a declaration of acceleration under the Senior Notes Indenture, but before a judgment
or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Senior Notes Trustee, the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes, by written notice to the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Senior Notes Trustee, may rescind such declaration and its consequences if:

(a) the Senior Notes Issuer has paid or deposited with the Senior Notes Trustee (or another party
designated by the Senior Notes Trustee for this purpose) a sum sufficient to pay:

(i) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts on all Senior Notes then outstanding;

(ii) all unpaid principal of and premium, if any, on any outstanding Senior Notes that has
become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by
the Senior Notes;

(iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest
and overdue principal at the rate borne by the Senior Notes; and

(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Senior Notes Trustee under the Senior Notes
Indenture and the properly incurred compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Senior
Notes Trustee, its agents and counsels;

(b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction; and

(c) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of amounts of principal of, premium, if any,
and any Additional Amounts and interest on the Senior Notes that has become due solely by such declaration of
acceleration, have been cured or waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

(6) Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Senior Notes may direct the Senior Notes Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.

(7) In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Senior Notes Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Notes Indenture at the request or direction of
any holders of the Senior Notes unless such holders have made written request and offered to the Senior Notes
Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Senior Notes Trustee against any loss, liability or expense
(which shall include the cost of the Senior Notes Trustee’s legal counsel). Except (subject to the provisions
described under “—Amendments and Waivers”) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if
any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of any of the Senior Notes has any right to institute
any proceedings with respect to the Senior Notes Indenture or any remedy thereunder, unless the holders of at

313


-----

least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have made written request to, and
offered indemnity and/or security satisfactory to, the Senior Notes Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee
under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Trustee has failed to institute such
proceeding within 30 days after receipt of such written notice and indemnity and/or security and the Senior
Notes Trustee within such 30-day period has not received directions inconsistent with such written request by
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes. Such limitations do not,
however, apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed
in such Note.

(8) If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Senior Notes Trustee,
the Senior Notes Trustee will deliver to each holder of the Senior Notes notice of the Default or Event of
Default within 30 Business Days after its actual knowledge of such occurrence. Except in the case of a Default
or an Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any
Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Trustee may withhold the notice to the holders of such Senior Notes if the Senior
Notes Trustee in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the holders of the Senior
Notes.

(9) The Senior Notes Issuer is required to furnish to the Senior Notes Trustee annual statements regarding
compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture and as to the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default. The
Senior Notes Issuer is also required to notify the Senior Notes Trustee in writing within 30 days of the
occurrence of any Default (unless cured) or Event of Default stating what action, if any, it is taking with respect
to such Default or Event of Default.

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Senior Notes Indenture**

The Senior Notes Issuer may at any time, at the option of its board of directors evidenced by a resolution set
forth in an Officer’s Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding
Senior Notes issued under an Senior Notes Indenture and all obligations of the Senior Notes Guarantors
discharged with respect to their applicable Senior Note Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”) except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Senior Notes to receive payments in respect of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Senior Notes (including Additional Amounts, if any) when
such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(b) the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Senior Notes, register, transfer or
exchange any Senior Notes, replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes, maintain an office or
agency for payments in respect of the Senior Notes and segregate and hold such payments in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Senior Notes Trustee and the
obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture.

In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Senior
Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation
to make Change of Control Offers and Excess Proceeds Offers) set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such covenants will not constitute a
Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs,
certain events described under “—Events of Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect
to the Senior Notes. These events do not include events relating to non-payment or, solely with respect to the
Senior Notes Issuer, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Senior Notes Issuer may
exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Senior Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with the
Senior Notes Trustee (or such other entity nominated by the Senior Notes Trustee for this purpose), for the
benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes, cash in euro, non- callable European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of internationally
recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay and discharge the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Amounts, if any), on the outstanding Senior

314


-----

Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Senior Notes
Issuer must (x) specify whether the Senior Notes are being defeased to such Stated Maturity or to a particular
redemption date; and (y) if applicable, have delivered to the Senior Notes Trustee an irrevocable notice to
redeem all the outstanding Senior Notes of such principal, premium, if any, or interest;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Senior Notes Issuer must have delivered to the Senior
Notes Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Senior Notes Trustee stating that (i) the Senior
Notes Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or
(ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the
effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the outstanding Senior
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Senior Notes Issuer must have delivered to the Senior
Notes Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Senior Notes Trustee to the effect that the
beneficial owners of the outstanding Senior Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) the Senior Notes Issuer must have delivered to the Senior Notes Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Notes Issuer with the intent of preferring the
holders of the Senior Notes over the other creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer or others; and

(e) the Senior Notes Issuer must have delivered to the Senior Notes Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an opinion of counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Senior Notes Trustee, subject to customary
assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the
Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Notes Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Senior Notes issued
thereunder when:

(a) either:

(i) all the Senior Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed,
lost or stolen Senior Notes that have been replaced or paid and Senior Notes for whose payment money
has been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust and thereafter repaid to the Senior Notes
Issuer or discharged from such trust as provided for in the Senior Notes Indenture) have been delivered
to the Paying Agent (and notified to the Senior Notes Trustee) for cancellation; or

(ii) all Senior Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to the
Senior Notes Trustee) for cancellation (x) have become due and payable (by reason of the mailing of a
notice of redemption or otherwise) or (y) will become due and payable within one year and the Senior
Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with
the Senior Notes Trustee (or such other entity nominated by the Senior Notes Trustee for this purpose)
as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes, cash in euro, non-callable
European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be
sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Debt
on the Senior Notes not delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to the Senior Notes Trustee) for
cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;
and

The Senior Notes Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any
conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Senior Notes Trustee.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes will have the right
to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Senior Notes Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that in case an
Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Senior Notes Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its
power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. The Senior Notes Trustee
will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Senior Notes Indenture at the
request of any holder of Senior Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Senior Notes Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense (which shall include the cost of the Senior
Notes Trustee’s legal counsel).

The Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify the Senior Notes
Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses (which shall include the cost of the Senior Notes Trustee’s
legal counsel) incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in
connection with its duties.

“Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to a specified Person for any period, the ratio

effect to any additional Debt to be incurred on the Calculation Date as part of the same transaction or series of
transactions pursuant to the second paragraph under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”),

business, acquisitions that have been made by the specified Person or any Restricted Subsidiary which is a
Subsidiary of such specified Person, including through mergers or consolidations, of any Person or any of its

Calculation Date, will be excluded;

(c) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with

following the Calculation Date;

(d) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period;

(e) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to
have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period; and

(f) if any Debt bears a floating rate of interest and such Debt is to be given pro forma effect, the
interest expense on such Debt will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Debt if such
Hedging Obligation has a remaining term as at the Calculation Date in excess of 12 months, or, if shorter, at
least equal to the remaining term of such Debt).

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Income Taxes,
Consolidated Adjusted Net Income and Fixed Charges, calculations will be as determined in good faith by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Senior Notes Issuer.

“Consolidated Leverage” means, as of any date of determination, the sum without duplication of the total
amount of Debt (excluding Hedging Obligations) of a specified Person and any of its Subsidiaries which are not
Unrestricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include Debt of a
Parent Company solely if incurred or guaranteed by such Person or by any of its Subsidiaries which are not
Unrestricted Subsidiaries (but not giving effect to any additional Debt to be incurred on the date of
determination as part of the same transaction or series of transactions pursuant to the second paragraph under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”).

ratio of (a) the Consolidated Leverage of such Person on such date to (b) the Consolidated EBITDA of such
Person for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available

Unrestricted Subsidiary incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise
discharges any Debt (other than ordinary working capital borrowings) or issues, repurchases or redeems
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio is made (for the purpose of this definition, the “Calculation Date”), then the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption,
guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Debt, or such issuance,
repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if

division of a business that have been made by such Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are not Unrestricted
Subsidiaries, including through mergers, consolidations, amalgamations or otherwise, or by any Person or any
of its Subsidiaries which are not Unrestricted Subsidiaries acquired by such Person or any of its Subsidiaries
which are not Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and including any related financing transactions and including increases
in ownership of Subsidiaries which are not Unrestricted Subsidiaries (including Persons who become
Subsidiaries which are not Unrestricted Subsidiaries as a result of such increase), during the four-quarter
reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date (including
transactions giving rise to the need to calculate such Consolidated Leverage Ratio) will be given pro forma
effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Senior Notes Issuer
and may include anticipated expense, cost reduction and cost saving synergies) as if they had occurred on the
first day of the four- quarter reference period;

(b) the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in
accordance with IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of on or prior to
the Calculation Date (including transactions giving rise to the need to calculate such Consolidated Leverage
Ratio), will be excluded;

(c) any Person that is a Subsidiary of such Person which is not an Unrestricted Subsidiary on the
Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a Subsidiary of such Person which is not an Unrestricted
Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period; and

(d) any Person that is not a Subsidiary of such Person or is an Unrestricted Subsidiary on the
Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a Subsidiary or to have been an Unrestricted Subsidiary at any
time during such four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an Asset Sale, Investment or
acquisition, the amount of income or earnings relating thereto or the amount of Consolidated EBITDA
associated therewith, the pro forma calculation shall be determined in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting Officer of the Senior Notes Issuer. In determining the amount of Debt outstanding on any date of
determination, pro forma effect will be given to any incurrence, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other
acquisition, retirement or discharge or Debt on such date (but not giving effect to any additional Debt to be
incurred on the date of determination as part of the same transaction or series of transactions pursuant to the
second paragraph under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”).

**Book-entry; delivery and form**

**General**

Each series of Temporary Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act were initially represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached
(each a “Rule 144A Global Temporary Note”). Each series of the Temporary Notes sold to non-U.S. persons
outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act and each series of
Notes issued in respect of such Temporary Notes were initially represented by a global note in registered form
without interest coupons attached (each a “Regulation S Global Temporary Note” and, together with the
Rule 144A Global Temporary Note, the “Global Temporary Notes”). The Global Temporary Notes were
deposited, on the Temporary Notes Issue Date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.

The Temporary Senior Secured Notes had different international securities identification numbers and common
codes (as applicable) from, and will not trade fungibly with, the corresponding Senior Secured Notes. On the
Completion Date, the Temporary Senior Secured Notes were automatically exchanged (and thereupon
cancelled) for Additional Senior Secured Notes having the same international securities identification numbers
and common codes (as applicable), and will trade fungibly with, the corresponding Senior Secured Notes.

The Notes issued in exchange for a Rule 144A Global Temporary Note on the Completion Date will initially be
represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global
Note”). The Notes issued in exchange for a Regulation S Global Temporary Note on the Completion Date will
initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S
Global Note” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes were
deposited, on the Completion Date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Temporary Note and the Rule 144A Global Note (the
“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Temporary Note and
the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book- Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg will hold interests in the Global Temporary Notes and the Global Notes on behalf of
their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not
be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained
by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including
certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge
Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Temporary Notes and the Notes are in global form, holders of
Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of the Temporary Notes or the Notes, as
applicable, for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg (or its nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all
purposes under the relevant Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to
exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the relevant Indenture.

None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or the Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive registered notes**

Under the terms of the relevant Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered
Notes in certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) only:

348


-----

(1) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg notifies the relevant Issuer that it is unwilling or unable
to continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the relevant Issuer within
120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg following an event of default under the relevant Indenture and enforcement action is
being taken in respect thereof under the relevant Indenture.

In such an event, the relevant Issuer will instruct the Registrar to issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in
the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear,
Clearstream, Luxembourg or us, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and
based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests),
and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided the relevant Indenture, unless
that legend is not required by the relevant Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as
the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of
the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer,
and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg.

**Redemption of the global notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from
the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in
connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear
and Clearstream, Luxembourg, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, if
fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will credit
their participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no Book-Entry
Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on global notes**

The relevant Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. The common depositary will distribute such payments to participants
in accordance with their customary procedures. The relevant Issuer will make payments of all such amounts
without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Additional Amounts” or “Description of the Senior Notes—
_Additional Amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described_
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Additional Amounts” or “Description of the Senior Notes—
_Additional Amounts,” we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received_
by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book- Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will
equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note
or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The relevant Issuer expects
that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of
Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the relevant Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee,
the Registrar and the Paying Agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the common
depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (or its nominee)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the

349


-----

Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any participant or indirect participant or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any participant or
indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any
participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants.

**Currency of payment for the global notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg in euro.

**Action by owners of book-entry interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of
one or more participants to whose account the Book- Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in
respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants
has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will not exercise any discretion in the
granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there
is an event of default under the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, at the request of the holders of
the Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder
of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to
persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of
Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the
U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and
in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

350


-----

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book- Entry Interests in a Global Note only
as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” or “Description of the
_Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a_
written certificate (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in
the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg, as applicable. We have provided the following summaries of those operations and procedures
solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled
by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible
for those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg: Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between their participants through electronic book- entry changes in accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that
interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in
definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In
addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg systems will receive
distributions attributable to the 144A Global Temporary Notes or 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg participants.

**Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system**

The Additional Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be
listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF
market. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg,
they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuers, any Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by
Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations
under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

351


-----

**Initial settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value
of the settlement date.

**Secondary market trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to
ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Trustee’s powers**

In considering the interests of the holders of Notes, while title to the Notes is registered in the name of a
nominee of a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to, and rely on, any information provided to it by
that clearing system as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its accountholders with entitlements
to Notes and may consider such interests as if such accountholders were the holders of the Notes.

**Enforcement**

For the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of the relevant Indenture against the Trustee, the persons
named in a certificate of the holder of the Notes in respect of which a Global Note is issued shall be recognized
as the beneficiaries of the trusts set out in the Indenture to the extent of the principal amounts of their interests in
the Notes set out in the certificate of the holder, as if they were themselves the holders of Notes in such principal
amounts.

**Transfer restrictions**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the_
_Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable
state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified
institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in
offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes or the Note Guarantees under the U.S. Securities Act and,
therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from,
or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we
offered and sold the Temporary Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re- offer and resale only:

- in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as defined in
Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to
and agreed with the relevant Issuer and the relevant Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, and that the Notes are being offered
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities law,
including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise
transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other
applicable state securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and
in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the relevant Issuer or acting on behalf of the relevant
Issuer and it is either:

(a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and
the acquisition of the Notes will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) it is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Guarantors,
the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers, or any person
representing any of them, have made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of any Notes
other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been
delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It has
had access to such financial and other information concerning us, the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Notes as
it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity
to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws,
subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or
accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant
to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

Each holder of Notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”) agrees on its own behalf and on
behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Rule 144A
Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to

353


-----

the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year after the later of the Temporary Notes Issue
Date and the last date on which the relevant Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of such Notes (or any
predecessor thereto) only (i) to the relevant Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a
registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes
are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its
own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on
Rule 144A, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in compliance with
Regulation S, or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its
property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in
compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further
subject to the relevant Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to
clause (iv) or (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information
satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the
form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The
foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date. Each
purchaser acknowledges that each Rule 144A Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER
THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES
ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION.
NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN
MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED,
ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT
SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT.

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, AGREES TO
OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE
DATE (THE “RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE”) THAT IS ONE
YEAR AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE HEREOF AND THE
LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS
THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF THIS
SECURITY) ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER, THE GUARANTORS OR ANY

(C) FOR SO LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE
PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”),

RELIANCE ON RULE 144A, (D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT

AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES TO
ANY REQUIREMENT OF LAW THAT THE DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR
THE PROPERTY OF SUCH INVESTOR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL
TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR CONTROL AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND ANY APPLICABLE LOCAL
LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND
THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER
(I) PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (D) OR (E) TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF AN
OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION
SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM, (II) IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING
CASES, TO REQUIRE THAT A CERTIFICATE OF TRANSFER IN THE FORM
APPEARING ON THE REVERSE OF THIS NOTE IS COMPLETED AND
DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR TO THE TRUSTEE; AND AGREES THAT IT

354


-----

WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A
NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND.

If it purchases Notes, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of
beneficial interests in Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(5) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers Notes notice of any restrictions on transfer
of such Notes. It acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any
Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the relevant Issuer and the Registrar
that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

(6) It acknowledges that the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar
and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties
and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements
deemed to have been made by its purchase of Notes is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the relevant
Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it
represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full
power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such
investor account.

(7) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the
relevant Issuer, any of the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes
or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or
the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes
will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution.”

**Tax considerations**

**Savings directive**

On June 3, 2003, the European Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted the Directive 2003/48/EC
on the taxation of savings income (the “Savings Directive”). Pursuant to the Savings Directive and subject to a
number of conditions being met, Member States are required, since July 1, 2005, to provide to the tax authorities
of another Member State, inter alia, details of payments of interest within the meaning of the Savings Directive
(interest, premium or other debt income) made by a paying agent located within its jurisdiction to, or for the
benefit of, an individual resident or certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State (the
“Disclosure of Information Method”).

For these purposes, the term “paying agent” is defined widely and includes in particular any economic operator
who is responsible for making interest payments, within the meaning of the Savings Directive, for the
immediate benefit of individuals. In the case at hand, (i) the Temporary Senior Secured Notes Issuer, (ii) the
Temporary Senior Notes Issuer, (iii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, (iv) the Senior Notes Issuer, (v) Euroclear
and Clearstream, Luxembourg, (vi) Euroclear’s and Clearstream, Luxembourg’s common depositary,
(vii) Euroclear’s and Clearstream, Luxembourg’s common depositary’s nominee or (viii) another entity may be
considered paying agent within the meaning of the Savings Directive depending on (a) the legal status of (v),
(vi), (vii) and (viii) and (b) the modalities of the payments made to the holders of the Notes.

However, throughout a transitional period, certain Member States (Austria), instead of using the Disclosure of
Information Method used by other Member States, withhold an amount on interest payments unless the relevant
beneficial owner of such payment elects for the Disclosure of Information Method or the tax certificate
procedure. The rate of such withholding is currently 35%.

Such transitional period will end at the end of the first full financial year following the later of (i) the date of
entry into force of an agreement between the European Community, following a unanimous decision of the
European Council, and the last of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco and Andorra, providing for
the exchange of information upon request as defined in the OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of
Information on Tax Matters released on April 18, 2002 (the “OECD Model Agreement”) with respect to interest
payments within the meaning of the Savings Directive, in addition to the simultaneous application by those
same countries of a withholding tax on such payments at the rate applicable for the corresponding periods
mentioned above and (ii) the date on which the European Council unanimously agrees that the United States of
America is committed to exchange of information upon request as defined in the OECD Model Agreement with
respect to interest payments within the meaning of the Savings Directive.

A number of non-EU countries and dependent or associated territories have agreed to adopt similar measures
(transitional withholding or exchange of information) with effect since July 1, 2005.

On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted EU Council Directive 2014/48/EU amending
and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new
requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the Savings
Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Savings Directive will
also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member
State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to or by, or secured for or by, persons,
entities or legal arrangements (including trusts), where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases
apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European
Union.

The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member
States which still operate a withholding system when they are implemented (i.e., Austria).

On May 14, 2013 the Council of the European Union gave a mandate to the EU Commission to negotiate
amended savings tax agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino to ensure
that these five countries continue to apply measures that are equivalent to the Savings Directive, as amended. In
March 2014, the Council of the European Union confirmed this mandate and asked the EU Commission to
continue the negotiations with a view to concluding them until the end of year 2014. The negotiations are still
ongoing.

**The proposed financial transactions tax (“FTT”)**

On February 14, 2014, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a
Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal,
Slovenia and Slovakia (the participating Member States).

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the
Temporary Notes or Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market
transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are exempt.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Temporary Notes
or Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating
Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State
in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating
Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating
Member State.

A joint statement issued in May 2014 by ten of the eleven participating Member States indicated an intention to
implement the FTT progressively, such that it would initially apply to shares and certain derivatives, with this
initial implementation occurring by January 1, 2016.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It may therefore be
altered prior to any implementation. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective
holders of the Temporary Notes or Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
FTT.

**Certain French tax consequences**

The following description is only addressed to beneficial owners of Additional Senior Secured Notes who are
not French residents for French tax purposes, who do not hold their Additional Senior Secured Notes in
connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France and who are neither shareholders nor
related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French code général des impôts (French Tax Code, the
“FTC”) of our company (for the purposes of this section the “holders” of Additional Senior Secured Notes).

The following only represents a summary of certain provisions of French tax laws and regulations, as currently
in effect and applied by the French tax authorities, which, due to its summary character, does not cover all
details and tax exemptions which may apply in specific individual cases and may even require a deviation
therefrom, including as a result of the application of the provisions of any relevant tax treaty.

The Savings Directive was implemented into French law under Articles 199 ter and 242 ter of the FTC, which
imposes on paying agents based in France an obligation to report to the French tax authorities certain
information with respect to interest payments made to beneficial owners domiciled in another EU Member
State, including among other things, the identity and address of the beneficial owner and a detailed list of the
different categories of interest paid to that beneficial owner.

According to Article 125 A III of the FTC, payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by a debtor
which is established in France with respect to a particular debt (including debt in the form of notes) are not
subject to withholding tax unless such payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory
(Etat ou territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC (a “Non-Cooperative
State”). If such payments are made in a Non- Cooperative State, a 75% withholding tax is applicable (subject to
certain exceptions certain of which are set forth below and to the more favorable provisions of any applicable
double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the FTC. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a
ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is up-dated each year.

Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the FTC, interest on debt and assimilated revenues will not be
deductible from the debtor’s taxable result if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a
Non- Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial institution established in such a
Non-Cooperative State. Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest may be re-characterized as
constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the FTC, in which case it may be subject to the
withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC, at a rate of 30% or 75% (subject to the more
favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty).

357


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Articles 125 A III and 238 A of the FTC provide that neither the 75%
withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the FTC nor, to the extent the relevant interest relate to
genuine transactions and is not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the non- deductibility rule set out under
Article 238 A of the FTC and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC that may be
levied as a result of such non deductibility, will apply in respect of a particular debt if the debtor can prove that
the main purpose and effect of such transactions was not that of locating the interest in a Non-Cooperative State
(the “Exception”). Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts (French administrative
guidelines) referenced as BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20140211 § 550 and 990,
BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-10-20-40-20140211 § 70 and BOI-ANNX-000364-20120912 (the “Administrative
Guidelines”), an issue of notes will benefit from the Exception without the issuer having to provide any
evidence supporting the main purpose and effect of such issue of notes, if such notes are:

- offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Code monétaire
_et financier (French Monetary and Financial Code) or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a state other than a_
Non-Cooperative State (for this purpose, an “equivalent offering” means any offering requiring the
registration or submission of an offering document by or with a foreign securities market authority);

- admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or on a multilateral financial instruments
trading facility provided that such market or facility is not located in an Non-Cooperative State and that
such market is operated by a market operator, an investment services provider, or by such other similar
foreign entity that is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or

- admitted, at the time of their issue, to the clearing operations of a central depositary or of a securities
clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French
_Code monétaire et financier, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators provided that such_
depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

The Additional Senior Secured Notes issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under this Offering
Memorandum qualify as debt securities under French commercial law. Considering (i) that, as of the date of
their admission to trading, the Additional Senior Secured Notes will be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF
Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in Luxembourg which does not qualify as a Non-Cooperative State
and that such market will be operated by a market operator which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and
(ii) that the Additional Senior Secured Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to the clearing
operations of Euroclear SA/NV and Clearstream Banking SA, i.e. to the clearing operations of a central
depositary or of a securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of
Article L. 561-2 of the French Code monétaire et financier which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State,
payments made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in respect of the Additional Senior Secured Notes to their
holders should benefit from at least one of the above mentioned exceptions and consequently be exempt from
the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the FTC. Moreover, under the same conditions and since
the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues should be considered as relating to genuine transactions and
not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and other assimilated revenues paid by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer on the Additional Senior Secured Notes should not be subject, pursuant to the Administratives
Guidelines, to the non-deductibility rule set out under Article 238 A of the FTC and, as a result, should not be
subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC solely on account of their being paid in
a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in a Non-Cooperative State.

A holder of Additional Senior Secured Notes who is not a resident of France for French tax purposes and who
does not hold its Additional Senior Secured Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed place
of business in France will not be subject to any income or withholding taxes in France in respect of the gains
realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of Notes.

Transfers of Additional Senior Secured Notes outside France are not subject to any stamp duty or other transfer
taxes imposed in France, except in the case of filing with the French tax authorities on a voluntary basis.

_Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg_
_income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a withholding tax or a tax of a_
_similar nature, or to any other concepts, refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only._

**_Withholding tax and self-applied tax_**

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in effect and subject to the Relibi Law (as defined below), there
is no Luxembourg withholding tax on payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest). There is also
no Luxembourg withholding tax upon repayment of principal in case of reimbursement, redemption, repurchase
or exchange of the Notes.

**_Luxembourg non-resident individuals_**

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in effect there is no Luxembourg withholding tax on payments of
interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) paid to Luxembourg non-resident individuals. There is also no
Luxembourg withholding tax upon repayment of principal in case of reimbursement, redemption, repurchase or
exchange of the Notes held by Luxembourg non-resident individuals.

**_Luxembourg resident individuals_**

Subject to the law of 23 December 2005, as amended (the “Relibi Law”) on the introduction of a withholding
tax on certain interest payments on savings income, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal,
premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in
respect of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held
by Luxembourg resident holders of Notes.

Under the Relibi Law, payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by Luxembourg paying agents
to an individual beneficial owner who is a resident of Luxembourg or to a residual entity (within the meaning of
the laws of 21 June 2005 implementing Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on the taxation of savings
income (the “Savings Directive”) and ratifying the treaties entered into by Luxembourg and certain dependent
and associated territories of EU Member States (the “Territories”), as amended) established in an EU Member
State (other than Luxembourg) or one of the Territories and securing such payments for the benefit of such
individual beneficial owner will be subject to a 10 per cent. withholding tax. Responsibility for the withholding
of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent.

Pursuant to the Relibi Law, Luxembourg resident individuals, acting in the course of the management of their
private wealth, can opt to self-declare and pay a 10 per cent. tax on interest payments made by paying agents
located in an EU Member State other than Luxembourg, a Member State of the European Economic Area other
than an EU Member State or in a State or territory which has concluded an international agreement directly
related to the Savings Directive.

**Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Additional Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes (collectively, the
“Issued Notes”) by a U.S. Holder (as defined below), who purchases the Issued Notes in the Offerings at the
offer price indicated on the cover page, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
This summary is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the
date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below.
There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Issued Notes or that any such position would not
be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment under the U.S.
federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in
securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
grantor trusts, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
partnerships or other pass through entities (or investors in such entities), persons liable for alternative minimum
tax and persons holding the Issued Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other

359


-----

integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Issued Notes for cash
at original issue and who hold the Issued Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code. This discussion does not address any tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences
and does not address the Medicare tax on certain investment income.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of an Issued Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any
entity taxable as a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Issued Notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of
the partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax
advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Issued Notes. The
discussion below assumes that the Issued Notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Issued Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax**
**consequences of holding Issued Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application**
**of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal**
**estate and gift tax laws and state, local, foreign or other tax laws.**

_Transactions related to the acquisition_

On the Acquisition Closing Date, the Temporary Notes were automatically exchanged for an equal aggregate
principal amount of Additional Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, the escrow proceeds were
released, and certain other transactions occurred in connection with the Acquisition. Although the issue is not
free from doubt, we intend to take the position (to the extent we are required to do so), and the remainder of this
discussion assumes, that the exchange of the Temporary Notes for the Additional Senior Secured Notes or
Senior Notes, as applicable, in connection with the Acquisition-Related Transactions will not be treated as an
“exchange” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If this position is respected, a U.S. Holder would not
recognize any income, gain or loss in connection with such transactions and would have the same adjusted tax
basis in the Additional Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, as the U.S. Holder had in the
Temporary Notes exchanged therefor. Moreover, the holding period for the Additional Senior Secured Notes or
Senior Notes, as applicable, would generally include the holding period for the Temporary Notes.

It is possible that the IRS could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the exchange of the Temporary Notes for
the Additional Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, as an “exchange” for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. If so, U.S. Holders would recognize gain or loss in connection with such exchange and would
have a new holding period and a new tax basis in the Additional Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as
applicable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of the Additional Senior
Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, at the time of such exchange is less than the principal amount of
the Additional Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, (by at least a statutorily defined de minimis
amount), the Additional Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, may be treated as issued with
original issue discount, in which case the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Issued Notes
described below may be different than what is described below.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them
of the Acquisition-Related Transactions.

_Pre-issuance accrued interest_

A portion of the price paid for the Temporary Senior Secured Notes will be allocable to interest that accrued
prior to the date such Temporary Senior Secured Notes are purchased (the “pre-issuance accrued interest”). We
intend to take the position that, on the first payment date, a portion of the interest received in an amount equal to
the pre-issuance accrued interest will be treated as a return of a portion of the purchase price paid for such
Temporary Senior Secured Notes that is allocable to the pre-issuance accrued interest and not as a payment of
interest on such Temporary Senior Secured Notes or Additional Senior Secured Notes or a pro rata prepayment
that retires a portion of such Temporary Senior Secured Notes or Additional Senior Secured Notes (except that a

360


-----

U.S. Holder generally would be required to recognize exchange gain or loss, as discussed below, in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the pre-issuance accrued interest at the time of
purchase and at the time the payment of such pre-issuance accrued interest is received, as determined at the spot
rate in effect on each such date). Amounts treated as a return of pre-issuance accrued interest should not be
taxable when received but should reduce a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Temporary Senior Secured
Notes (or Additional Senior Secured Notes exchanged therefor, which is treated as a continuation of the same
debt instrument as the Temporary Senior Secured Notes) by a corresponding amount.

_Amortizable bond premium_

If a U.S. Holder purchases a Temporary Senior Secured Note for an amount (not including any amount paid for
pre-issuance accrued interest) that is greater than the principal amount of the Temporary Senior Secured Note,
the U.S. Holder will be considered to have purchased the Temporary Senior Secured Note with amortizable
bond premium. For this purpose, in determining the amount of amortizable bond premium, it will initially be
assumed that we will exercise our rights to redeem the Temporary Senior Secured Notes (or Additional Senior
Secured Notes exchanged therefor, which is treated as a continuation of the same debt instrument as the
Temporary Senior Secured Notes) at a premium if doing so results in a smaller amortizable bond premium
attributable to the period to the date of such earlier redemption, and subsequent adjustments may be made if we
do not in fact exercise our redemption rights. This assumption may eliminate, reduce or defer any amortizable
bond premium. With some exceptions, a U.S. Holder may elect to amortize this premium over the remaining
term of the Temporary Senior Secured Note (including the term of the Additional Senior Secured Note) on a
constant yield method. A U.S. Holder making this election must generally use any amortizable bond premium
allocable to an accrual period to offset interest required to be included in income with respect to the Temporary
Senior Secured Note or Additional Senior Secured Notes exchanged therefor in such accrual period and reduce
its tax basis in the Temporary Senior Secured Note or Additional Senior Secured Notes exchanged therefor by
the amount of the premium amortized in any year. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable
debt obligations then owned and thereafter acquired by such U.S. Holder and such election may be revoked only
with the consent of the IRS. Amortizable bond premium will be computed in euros. A U.S. Holder making the
election to amortize bond premium may recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between the
U.S. dollar value of bond premium amortized with respect to a period determined on the date the interest
attributable to such period is received and the U.S. dollar value of that portion of the bond premium determined
on the date of the acquisition of the Issued Notes. If a U.S. Holder does not make such election, bond premium
will be included in its basis for purposes of computing the amount of gain or loss recognized on the taxable
disposition of a Temporary Senior Secured Note or Additional Senior Secured Notes exchanged therefor.

_Payments of interest_

Subject to the descriptions relating to pre-issuance accrued interest and amortizable bond premium above,
payments of stated interest on the Issued Notes (including any non-U.S. tax withheld on such payments and any
Additional Amounts) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such
payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest will be required to include in ordinary income the U.S. dollar value of the euro
interest payment (translated at the “spot rate” on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash method U.S. Holder will not recognize exchange gain or
loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual
disposition of the euros so received.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required
to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in euros that has accrued with
respect to an Issued Note during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued income will be
determined by translating such income at the average rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to
an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year.

A U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income using the rate of exchange on the
last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the rate of
exchange on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year. Additionally, if payment
of the accrued interest is received within five business days of the last day of an accrual period, a U.S. Holder
may instead translate such interest at the “spot rate” on the date of actual receipt. The above election will apply

361


-----

to other obligations held by the U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual
basis U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such
interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between
the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the “spot rate” on the date such payment is
received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that has accrued during
such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S.
dollars. Such gain or loss will generally constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

_Foreign tax credit_

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss above, interest income on an Issued Note generally will
constitute foreign source income and be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax
credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a
U.S. Holder at a rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or, at such holder’s
election, a deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable
limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a
U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability
of foreign tax credits.

_Sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of issued notes_

Generally, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Issued Note, a U.S.
Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition
(less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously included in income, which will be
taxable as such) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Issued Note. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign
currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Issued Note, the
amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency translated at the “spot
rate” on the date of disposition. In the case of an Issued Note that is traded on an established securities market, a
cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of
the amount realized by translating such amount at the “spot rate” on the settlement date of the disposition. If an
accrual-basis U.S. Holder does not make such election, such U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of
the amount realized by translating such amount at the “spot rate” on the trade date of the disposition.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Issued Note will initially equal, in the case of a Temporary Note, the
cost of such Temporary Note to such U.S. Holder, and in the case of an Additional Senior Secured Note or a
Senior Note, as described above under “—Transactions Related to the Acquisition,” and in each case will be
decreased by any principal payments previously received by such U.S. Holder and the amount of amortizable
bond premium previously taken into account. If a U.S. Holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Temporary
Note, the cost of the Temporary Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase
price by translating such amount at the “spot rate” on the date of purchase. However, in the case of a Temporary
Note that is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder, and, if it so elects, an accrual
basis U.S. Holder, will generally determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Temporary Note by
translating the amount paid at the “spot rate” on the settlement date of the purchase.

If an Issued Note is not traded on an established securities market (or, if an Issued Note is so traded, but a U.S.
Holder is an accrual basis taxpayer that has not made the settlement date election), a U.S. Holder will recognize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) to the extent that the U.S. dollar
value of the foreign currency received (based on the “spot rate” on the settlement date of the disposition) differs
from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized (based on the “spot rate” on the trade date of the disposition).

The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the purchase and sale of Issued Notes
traded on an established securities market, which is discussed in the preceding paragraphs, must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss below, gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Issued Note (i) generally will be U.S. source gain or
loss and (ii) generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the
sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition the Issued Note has been held by such U.S.
Holder for more than one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be
subject to taxation at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation.

362


-----

Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale,
exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Issued Notes.

A U.S. Holder may recognize exchange rate gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of an Issued Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar values of the U.S.
Holder’s purchase price (excluding the portion attributable to the pre-issuance accrued interest and excluding
any bond premium previously amortized) for the Issued Note (i) on the date such Issued Note is disposed of and
(ii) on the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Issued Note (or, in each case, on the settlement date, if the
Issued Notes are traded on an established securities market and the holder is either a cash basis U.S. Holder or
an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder). Such gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally
will be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively. In addition, exchange
gain or loss may be realized with respect to accrued interest as discussed above under “—Payments of Interest.”
However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Issued Note, a U.S.
Holder will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and accrued interest only to the extent of the
total gain or loss realized on the disposition.

_Reportable transactions_

Under Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain
circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign
currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that any such sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. U.S. Holders should consult their
tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Issued Notes,
including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

_Certain information reporting requirements with respect to foreign financial assets_

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals are required to file IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign
Financial Assets) to report information relating to an interest in the Issued Notes, subject to certain exceptions
(including an exception for Issued Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). Under
certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. Holders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these requirements on their ownership and
disposition of the Issued Notes. Penalties may apply for failure to properly complete and file IRS Form 8938.

_Fungible issue_

The relevant Temporary Notes Issuer or the relevant Issuer may, without the consent of the holders of
outstanding Issued Notes, issue additional notes with identical terms. These additional notes, even if they are
treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Issued Notes, in some cases may be treated
as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such a case, the additional notes may be considered
to have been issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes even if the original Issued
Notes had no original issue discount. These differences may affect the market value of the original Issued Notes
if the additional notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Issued Notes.

_Backup withholding and related information reporting requirements_

In general, payments of interest and the proceeds from sales or other dispositions (including retirements or
redemptions) of Issued Notes held by a U.S. Holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S.
Holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In addition, a U.S. Holder that is not
an exempt recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number
and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a
U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the
appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS.

_FATCA_

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a “foreign
financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain passthru payments made after
December 31, 2016 to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments.
Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations

363


-----

defining foreign passthru payments are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified
after such date. Accordingly, if the relevant Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would
apply to payments on the Issued Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Issued Notes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. However, if additional notes are
issued after the expiration of the grandfather period, have the same CUSIP or ISIN as the Issued Notes issued
hereby and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all notes in such series,
including the Issued Notes issued hereby, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Non-U.S. governments have
entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into
such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. Holders should
consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Issued Notes. In the event
any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Issued Notes, there generally
will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of the security**
**interests and note guarantees and certain**
**insolvency law considerations**

_Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in each of the jurisdictions in the Senior_
_Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and Guarantors are organized. This is a summary only, and_
_bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar proceedings, could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the_
_jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple_
_jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect your_
_ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Temporary Notes, the Notes, the Note_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests on the Collateral._

**European Union**

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency
Regulation”), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is
the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main
interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any
such company has its “center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU
Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its “center of main interests” in the EU
Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the
“center of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect,
factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its
business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant
in the determination of the place where the company has its “center of main interests.”

If the “center of main interests” of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would
be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence
the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency
proceedings opened in one EU Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the
other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another EU
Member State. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark),
under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than
Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an
“establishment” in the territory of such other EU Member State. The effects of those territorial proceedings are
restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU Member State. If the company does
not have an establishment in any other EU Member State, no court of any other EU Member State has
jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. In
the event that any one or more of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Guarantors or
any of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or
the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations
and the security of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the center of main interests of any of
the Issuers or any of the Guarantors is deemed to be in France, it would be subject to French proceedings
affecting creditors, including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings) and
court-administered proceedings being either safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde financière
_accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings_
(liquidation judiciaire). In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and

protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under
the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests in
the Collateral.

Under the European Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, if a debtor is located
in the European Union (other than Denmark), French courts shall have jurisdiction over the main insolvency
proceedings if the debtor’s center of main interests is situated in France. In the case of a debtor or legal person,
the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be its center of main interests in the absence of proof to
the contrary. In determining whether the center of main interests of a debtor is in France, French courts will take
into account a broad range of factual elements.

The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational
purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the
Notes.

_Grace periods_

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article 1244-1
_et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil)._

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving
the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and
the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of
payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled,
will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published
annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A
court order made under Article 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement
measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the
grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

With respect to grace periods under Articles 1244-1 and subsequent of the French Civil Code, pursuant to
article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may,
during the execution period of a conciliation agreement, impose grace periods on creditors having participated
in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) for their claims that were
not dealt with in the conciliation agreement.

**_Insolvency test_**

Under French law, a company is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is
unable to pay its due debts with its available assets taking into account available credit lines, existing debt
rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court ruling
commencing the insolvency proceedings, unless the Court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to
18 months before the date of such opening ruling.

**Court-assisted proceedings**

A French debtor facing difficulties without being insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) (or for less than
45 calendar days in the case of conciliation proceedings) may request the commencement of court-assisted
proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main
creditors and stakeholders e.g. agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness. Mandat ad hoc and
_conciliation are proceedings carried out under the supervision of the Court, which do not trigger any stay of_
enforcement against the debtor.

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice, mandat_
_ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not in a state of insolvency_
(cessation de paiements) (see “Insolvency test” above). They are informal, confidential and are not limited in
time. They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc, whose name can be
suggested by the debtor) itself under the supervision of the Court and do not automatically involve any stay of
the claims or pending proceedings The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent Court
that appoints him or her. Mandataires ad hoc are usually appointed in order to facilitate negotiations with

366


-----

creditors but cannot coerce the creditors into accepting any proposal. The agreement reached between the debtor
and its creditors (if any) with the help of the mandataire ad hoc will be negotiated on a purely consensual and
voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. Creditors are not
barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but they usually accept not to do so. In
any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period, as set forth above. The
agreement reached is reported to the Court but is not formally approved by it. The ordinance of the Court
appointing the Mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for information purposes to the debtor’s auditors.

_Conciliation proceedings are available to a debtor that faces current or foreseeable difficulties of a legal,_
economic or financial nature and which (at the time the conciliation proceedings are commenced) has not been
in a state of insolvency (cessation de paiements) (see “Insolvency test” above) for more than 45 calendar days.
The debtor petitions the President of the Commercial Court for the appointment of a conciliator (whose name it
can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or
trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties, providing e.g. for the restructuring of its indebtedness.
_Conciliation proceedings are confidential and may last up to four months (an additional one month extension_
can be requested by the conciliator). During the proceedings, creditors may continue to individually claim
payment of their claims but they usually accept not to. In addition, the debtor retains the right to petition the
judge who opened the proceedings for grace periods pursuant to article L. 1244-1 of the French Civil Code as
set forth above, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliator.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be either acknowledged (constaté) by the President
of the Commercial Court or approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court. It will become binding upon them
only and the creditors party thereto may not take action against the debtor in respect of claims governed by the
conciliation agreement. The acknowledgement (constatation) of the conciliation agreement by the President of
the Commercial Court upon all parties’ request, gives the agreement the legal force of a final judgment, which
means that it constitutes a judicial title that can be enforced by the parties without further recourse to a judge
(titre exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. So long as the conciliation agreement is
in effect, interest accruing on the affected claims can no longer be compounded.

In case of acknowledgement (constat) or approval (homologation), the Court can, at the request of the debtor,
appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord)
during its execution.

The approval (homologation) by the Court, upon the debtor’s request will make the existence of the conciliation
proceedings public and have the following specific consequences:

- creditors who provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of
the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a
priority of payment over all pre-proceedings and post-proceedings claims (except with respect to certain
pre-petition employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent
safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation; and

- in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date
of the cessation des paiements, and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below—
see The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings),
cannot be set by the Court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement
by the Court (see above regarding the definition of the date of the cessation des paiements) except in case
of fraud.

The court decision approving the conciliation agreement does not make its terms public (save for the
information of the works council or the employees representatives, if any, on the content of the agreement) but
makes public the guarantees and the terms of the New Money Lien granted to the creditors under the
conciliation agreement.

While the agreement (whether acknowledged or approved) is in force the debtor retains the right to petition the
Court that opened conciliation proceedings for a debt rescheduling, pursuant to Article 1244-1 et seq. of the
French Civil Code mentioned above, in relation to claims of creditors (other than public creditors) party to the
conciliation, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliator in the event that he has
been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

367


-----

A third party having granted a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or a security interest (sûreté réelle) with respect to
the debtor’s obligations can benefit from the provisions of the approved or acknowledged conciliation
agreement.

In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to it can petition the President of the
Commercial Court for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the
conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided that the conciliation agreement is duly
performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims included in the agreement are
suspended. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the
conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims, decreased by the payments already
received, and their security interests.

Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large
majority of creditors which is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, will
be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings, as described below.

In the event of the commencement of subsequent safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, within the
context of the adoption of a safeguard plan or a recovery plan, the Court will not be able to impose a payment
deferral to a date later than the date on which the plan is adopted, or debt reductions, to creditors with respect to
their claims benefiting from the New Money Lien.

At the request of the debtor and after the participating creditors have been consulted on the matter, the
conciliator may be appointed with a mission to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor which would be
implemented, as applicable, in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings; any offers received in this context by the conciliator may be directly submitted to the Court in the
context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor.

Any contractual provision that modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing
the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of
the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end, and any contractual
provision requiring the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the
commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers
retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, are deemed null and void.

**_Court-administered proceedings—safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (en état
_de cessation des paiements). Creditors of the debtor do not attend the hearing before the Court at which the_
commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings,
a court-appointed administrator is usually appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an
observation period (the period from the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the date on
which the Court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months, and to
help the debtor elaborate a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will propose to its
creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor,
assisted by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) who will, in accordance with the terms
of the judgment, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (“mission de surveillance”) or
assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (“mission d’assistance”), all under the
supervision of the Court.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the commencement of
the proceedings is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the Court can authorize payments
for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s
business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). In
addition, creditors are required to declare to the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire) the debts that arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings (as well as the_
post-commencement non-privileged debts) and are prohibited from engaging any court proceedings against the
debtor for any payment default in relation to such debts, and the accrual of interest on loans with a term of less
than one year (or on payments deferred for less than one year) is stopped. Debts duly arising after the
commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the debtor’s business

368


-----

activities during the observation period (see above), are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in
consideration for services rendered or goods delivered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and
when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New Money Lien).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the plan (debt
forgiveness and payment terms) prior to the plan being approved by the Court.

The rules governing consultation vary according to the size of the business.

_Standard consultation: for debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or prepared by a_
chartered accountant, and who have less than 150 employees or €20 million of turnover, the administrator
notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who obtains the
agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment times proposed.
Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the proposals for settlement can vary according to the creditor and whether
the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at the consultation stage. According to legal
commentaries and established practice, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition, differing treatment as
between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved
by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a
proposal for a partial payment of the claim over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of the claim over
ten years.

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is
approved do not need to be consulted.

Creditors consulted in writing which do not respond within 30 days are deemed to have accepted the proposal.
The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the
administrator and the controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to
them, the Court that approves the reorganization plan (plan de redressement) can impose on them a uniform
rescheduling of their claims (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien) over
a maximum period of ten years (except for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the
Court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt-for-equity
swap may be imposed without its creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting
the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be of at least 5% of the
total amount of the debt claim) or the year following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the date of
the first anniversary of the adoption of the plan, in which case the amount of the payment is determined in
accordance with the specific rules in order to ensure that the full amount of the claim is repaid within the 10 year
period.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting
the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be of at least 5% of the
total amount of the debt claim) or the year following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the date of
the first anniversary of the adoption of the plan, in which case the amount of the payment is determined in
accordance with the specific rules in order to ensure that the full amount of the claim is repaid within the 10 year
period.

_Committee-based consultation: In the case of large companies (whose accounts are certified by a statutory_
auditor or established by a chartered- accountant and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than
€20 million), or with the consent of the Court in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned
thresholds, two creditors’ committees have to be established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of
the claims that arose prior to the initial judgment:

- one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor
of the debtor (the “Credit Institutions Committee”)and

369


-----

- the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of
all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed
administrator (the “Major Suppliers Committee”).

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes), a general meeting
of all holders of such debt securities will be established irrespective of whether or not there are different
issuances and of the governing law of those obligations (the “Bondholders’ General Meeting”). The Notes
constitute obligations for the purposes of safeguard proceedings.

It is unclear whether the Security Agent as creditor of the Parallel Debt under the Intercreditor Agreement would
vote in the creditor’s committee.

The proposed plan:

- must take into account subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of
the proceedings;

- may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

- may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims
benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the
relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by
way of a set- off with their claims against the debtor, as reduced as the case may be according to the provisions
of the plan.

Creditors which are members of the credit institutions’ committee or the suppliers’ committee may also prepare
an alternative safeguard or reorganization plan that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the
general bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval of these alternative plans is subject to the same
two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the Bondholders General Meeting and gives rise to a report
by the judicial administrator). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within a minimum of 15 days of its submission. The
plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee, provided that the majority is two-thirds of the
outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote.

Each creditor member of a creditors committee and each holder of the Notes must, if applicable, inform the
judicial administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to the exercise of its vote, to the full or total
payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The judicial administrator shall
then submit to the creditor/holder of the Notes a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors
committee/Bondholders General Meeting. In the event of a disagreement, the creditor/holder of the Notes or the
judicial administrator may request that the matter be decided by the President of the Commercial Court in
summary proceedings. The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise
to voting rights.

In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a
payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do
not take part in the vote. Such creditors do not need to be consulted on the plan.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to
the Bondholders’ General Meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’
committees and the Bondholders’ General Meeting and determination of a rescheduling of the claim of creditors
that are not members of the committees or bondholders as discussed hereafter, the plan has to be approved
(arrêté) by the Court. In considering such approval, the Court has to verify that the interests of all creditors are
sufficiently protected and that relevant shareholder consent, if any is required, has been obtained. Once
approved by the Court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all
bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

Creditors outside the creditors’ committees or the Bondholders’ General Meeting are consulted in accordance
with the standard consultation process referred to above.

370


-----

In the event that the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the Bondholders’ General
Meeting within the first six months of the observation period, either because they do not vote on the plan or
because they reject it, this six month period may be extended by the Court at the request of the judicial
administrator, to the extent it does not exceed the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be
approved by the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the Court can still adopt a
safeguard plan in the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the
same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the Court empowers the administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting in order to take corporate
resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s share capital required by a safeguard plan, the Court
may order that, under certain conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the
shareholders attending or represented, as long as such shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting
rights.

If no plan is adopted by the committees, at the request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the mandataire
_judiciaire or the public prosecutor, the Court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization_
proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard
proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: Public creditors (financial administrations, social security_
and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are
similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in
a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or
mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions, within
the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax
administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from
default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

In the event that safeguard (or judicial reorganization) proceedings are commenced against any of the Issuers,
the holders of the relevant Notes will not be members of the credit institutions’ committee but would vote on
any proposed draft safeguard plan as members of the Bondholders’ General Meeting.

**_Court-administered proceedings—accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard_**

A debtor in conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde
_financière accélérée)._

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to
“fast-track” difficulties of large companies:

- who publish consolidated accounts in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or

- who publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and
have (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million excluding VAT or (iii) whose
total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is broadly the
regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing in
accelerated safeguard and/or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, since the total duration of the
accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months, while the duration of the accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings is one month, unless the Court decides to extend it by an additional month.

In particular, the creditors committees and the Bondholders General Meeting are required to vote on the
proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of fifteen days of its being sent to the creditors in the case of
accelerated safeguard proceedings or within 8 days thereof in accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The plan adopted in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably
provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital in the debtor
(debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent).

371


-----

The accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to
the credit institutions committee and bondholders), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a
plan through the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. As to financial creditors, the debtor will be
prohibited from paying any amounts (including interests) in connection with the finance documents that fall due
during the observation period. Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the Court approving the
safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public
creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of
business according to their contractual or legal terms.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor
must fulfill three conditions:

- the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of
accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings;

- as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position
to overcome; and

- the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of his business as a going
concern supported by enough of its creditors subject to the proceedings members of, as applicable, its
Credit Institutions or Major Suppliers committee or its Bondholders’ General Meeting, to render likely its
adoption by a two-thirds majority of the relevant Committee and General Meeting within a maximum of
three months following the commencement of of accelerated safeguard proceedings and of one month
following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (that can be extended by an
additional month).

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the Court within the deadlines applicable to each, the
Court shall terminate the proceedings. The Court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the
committee process.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceeding shall be drawn up by the debtor and certified
by the statutory auditor and shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of the
accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below)
unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).

**_Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) may be
initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, with respect to liquidation proceedings only, if the
debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming
insolvent. De jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to
civil liability if it fails to do so.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the Court considers
that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, after having heard the debtor, the Court may
order the commencement of the proceedings which it finds most appropriate. The same would apply if the
debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the Court considers that judicial
reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate.

In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the
administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or (at its own
initiative) the Court may convert safeguard proceedings into reorganization proceedings or liquidation
proceedings. In all cases, the Court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the judicial
administrator, the creditors’ representative, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

Under the judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator appointed by the Court will assist the debtor to
make management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the Court to take over the
management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). As a result of the commencement of
liquidation proceedings, the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of the management.

372


-----

In the event of reorganization, an administrator is usually appointed by the Court (administrateur judiciaire) to
investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make
proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a reorganization plan,
which is similar to a safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor.

Committees of creditors and a Bondholders General Meeting may be created under the same conditions as in
safeguard proceedings (see above). At any time during this observation period, the Court can order the
liquidation of the debtor. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the
Court.

If the Court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the Court will appoint a liquidator, which is
generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). No maximum time period is provided by
law to limit the duration of the judicial liquidation process. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent
the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the
extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for
payment).

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation
scenario:

- an asset sale plan (in which case the Court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the debtor
and organize such sale of the business); or

- a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

`o` launch auction sales;

`o` sell on an amicable basis each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received,
(the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement
with the bidder); or

`o` request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, from all potential interested purchasers to
bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders
submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such
hearing (procédure des plis cachetés).

When either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du
_passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets_
(insuffisance d’actif), the Court terminates the proceedings.

In reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to
a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by article L.626-3 of the French Commercial
Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire en justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to
vote on behalf of the shareholders which refuse to vote in favour of such a resolution if the draft restructuring
plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the
recovery plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the Court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial
transfer of the business.

The Court may terminate the proceedings when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is
disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets. The Court may also appoint a mandataire in
charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the
remaining creditors.

**_The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing
proceedings, unless the Court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of
such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the date of insolvency may not be set at a date earlier than the
date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation

373


-----

proceedings (see above). The date of insolvency is important because it marks the beginning of the “période
_suspecte” (otherwise referred to as “hardening period”), being the period between the date of insolvency and the_
Court decision commencing the proceedings. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are
void as of right or voidable by the Court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments
entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some
creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no or nominal consideration,
contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party,
payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner which is not commonly used in
the ordinary course of business and security granted for debts (including a security granted to secure a guarantee
obligation) previously incurred and provisional measures (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of
insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement
(fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for debt incurred simultaneously), any amendment to a trust
arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as a guarantee of debt incurred
prior to such amendment, and a declaration of non-seizability (déclaration d’insaisissabilité).

Transactions voidable by the Court include payments made on accrued debts, transactions for consideration and
notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions
made during the hardening period, in each case if the Court determines that the creditor knew of the insolvency
of the debtor. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered
into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the safeguard or insolvency proceedings
constitutes an event of default are not enforceable against the debtor. Neither, in accordance with a decision of
the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n°12-22.909, are “contractual provisions modifying the
conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the
debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (case law which is likely to be extended to
safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed
officer can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor
will not be able to continue to perform.

Conversely, the court-appointed officer can, require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their
obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs
its post-petition contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent
consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery).. The commencement of liquidation
proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the Court
orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business”
(plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration
of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the
business” or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

- accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts
providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year, with respect to which, however, accrued
interest can no longer be compounded;

- the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject
to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments
authorized by the insolvency judge appointed by the Court to recover assets for which recovery is justified
by the continued operation of the business);

- the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after commencement of the proceedings unless
they are incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of
services rendered/ goods provided to the debtor;

- creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor where
such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing
the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is:

374


-----

`o` to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the
creditor may require that a Court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as
described below);

`o` to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

`o` to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except where such asset- whether
tangible or intangible, movable or immovable-is located in another Member State within the
European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the
insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 EU Insolvency Regulation;

- immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrats en cours), absent
consent to other terms of payment, will be required only in the context of reorganization or liquidation
proceedings.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the
creditors that are subject to the accelerated safeguard proceedings or the accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings respectively (see above).

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of proceedings
must file a claim with the court - appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the
court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales) (; this period is
extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’
representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of claim has been filed yet, the claim as reported by the
debtor is deemed to be a filing on the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the debtor. Creditors
are allowed to ratify a proof of claim made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility
of the claim. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not
deemed filed with the creditors’ representative are, except with respect to limited exceptions, barred from
receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations
and are preferential creditors under French law.

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however:

- debts owed to creditors other than banks, financial institutions or bondholders should be paid in the
ordinary course; and

- the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings,
which is certified by its statutory auditors (failing which, its accountant). Although such creditors may file
proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative
and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the
above two or four months’ time limit). Those financial creditors who did not take part in the conciliation
proceedings (but who would belong to the financial institutions’ committee or the Bondholders’ General
Meeting) would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the Court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or
reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. The
Court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of
the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

If the Court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or
judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors
according to the ranking of the claims. If the Court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the
Court will appoint a liquidator (usually the former creditor’s representative) in charge of managing the debtor,
selling the assets of the debtor and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in
practice, where the sale of the business is considered, the Court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to
manage the debtor during the temporary continuation of the business operations (see above) and organize the
sale of the business process.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees,
post-petition legal costs (essentially, fees of the officials appointed by the Court), creditors who, as part of the
approved conciliation agreement, have provided new money or goods or services, post-petition creditors, certain

375


-----

pre-petition secured creditors in the event of liquidation proceedings and the French State (taxes and social
charges).

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, the immediate payment of any unpaid amount of share
capital of the debtor will be required.

The mandataire judiciaire may demand that a shareholder pay-up its portion of the unpaid share capital.

_Void and voidable transaction_

“Void transactions” include transactions or payments entered into during the suspect period that may constitute
voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include
transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the company
significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made
in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, any escrow ordered by a judicial
decision if such decision is not final when reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced, security
granted for debts previously incurred, any provisional measures (unless the writ of attachment or seizure
predates the date of insolvency) operations relating to stock options, fiduciary transfers (unless the transfer is
made as a security for an indebtedness entered into simultaneously) and modifications to existing fiduciary
transfers securing previous debts.

“Voidable transactions” include payments for due debts made from the date of insolvency, transactions for
consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie
_attribution) and oppositions made during the suspect period if the party dealing with the debtor company knew_
that it was insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”). Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration
are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the suspect period.

_Creditors’ liability_

Pursuant to article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case law, where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held liable
for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor only if the granting of such facilities was
wrongful and, in the case of (i) fraud; (ii) interference with the management of the debtor or (iii) if the security
or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or
guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can
be cancelled or reduced by the court.

_Limitations on guarantees_

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

- certain exceptions, including to the extent any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited
financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Code de Commerce or
infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3 or L. 242-6 of the French Code de Commerce, it being
specified that, under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition; and

- a contractual financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the Offering of the
Notes which the Issuer has applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each French Guarantor and/or the
controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor through the intercompany loans and cash pooling
arrangements that are outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee or security and, if
payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipient return the
payment to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the guarantor or security provider
did not derive an overall corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security
as a whole. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed
are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear
guidance.

French case law has recognized that certain inter group transactions (including upstream guarantees) can be in
the corporate interest of the relevant company, in particular, where the following criteria are fulfilled:

376


-----

- the existence of a genuine group of companies (taken as a whole, not just its shareholders) operating under
a common strategy aimed at a common objective;

- the existence of a common economic, social or financial interests of the group within the framework of a
policy implemented by the group of companies;

- the transaction shall not be without due consideration and compensation and shall not change the existing
balance between the respective obligations of the relevant companies;

- the risk assumed by a French Guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit. The French Guarantor must
receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction involving the
granting by it of the guarantee; and

- the obligations of the French Guarantor under the guarantee shall not exceed its financial capability.

Accordingly, the Note Guarantees by the French Guarantors are limited to amounts recoverable thereunder will
be limited to amounts that represent either (i) the amount of debt that each such French Guarantor and the
controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor can be deemed to have refinanced with the proceeds of the
Notes through the intercompany loans and (ii) the amounts of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly,
to such French Guarantor, and the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor, through the intercompany
loans, via the group’s cash-pooling arrangements or otherwise, and outstanding on the date a payment is
requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee. Any payment made by such French
Guarantor under its guarantee or under the intercompany loans or the cash pooling arrangements will reduce the
maximum amount of its guarantee. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Description of the Additional Senior
_Secured Notes—The Note Guarantees.”_

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less
than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length
basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction
could be taxable under certain circumstances.

_Limitation on enforcement of security interests_

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be enforced
following a payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured amount that is due and
remaining unpaid.

Under French law, generally speaking, pledges over assets may be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) before a court (a) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of
the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (b) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of
the pledged assets; or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle or pacte commissoire)
of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of
the pledged assets. Enforcement by way of contractual foreclosure may not be agreed at the time of the granting
of the security or subsequently and, therefore, the Noteholders will not benefit from such enforcement method.

If the secured creditors choose enforcement by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or contractual
foreclosure), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed assets. Such
value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by an
expert (pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a judged) in the context of a contractual foreclosure (pacte
_commissoire). In case of enforcement by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or contractual_
foreclosure), if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors
will be required to pay the relevant pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between the value of the pledged
assets and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral. On the contrary, if the value
of such pledged assets is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant
creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such pledged assets, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

377


-----

_Parallel debt_

Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor
be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties who do not
hold the secured claim, unless they act as trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or
as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Article 2328-1 of the French Civil Code, which is not the case here
for the Security Documents governed by French law. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will
not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the Noteholders to benefit indirectly from a secured
claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “Parallel Debt.” Pursuant to such Parallel
Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel
Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the
Collateral. Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held(in a decision dated September 13,
2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n° 10-25.533 Belvédère) rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings
opened in France) that, subject to certain conditions being met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by the
laws of the State of New York was not incompatible with the French law concept of international public policy
(ordre public international), this decision cannot be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in
France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no assurance can be given
that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. There is no certainty that the Parallel
Debt construction will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the
Security Interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other
parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the
Collateral.

_Trustee_

Pledges governed by French law will be granted to the benefit of the Security Agent as trustee for the holders of
the Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and may therefore not directly be granted to
holders of the Notes. A concept of “trust” has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis of the
French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held, in the Belvédère decision
referred to above in respect of the parallel debt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed
by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in
France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the La Haye
Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust”
has not been generally recognized under French law.

_Fraudulent conveyance_

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency
proceedings, the “action paulienne” provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a
decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an
agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or
agrees to provide or provides security for any of such person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into
additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be
challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du
_plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside_
insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act
in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person
performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s
insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and
(iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should
have known that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means
of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which case such knowledge
of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a
court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the Security Interests in the Collateral, or the granting of
a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the
issuance of the Notes, the granting of the Security Interests in the Collateral or the granting of such guarantee
could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged
the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not
enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Security Interests in the Collateral and the value of

378


-----

any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the Security Interests in the
Collateral or the Note Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly,
from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for
any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent
conveyance.

_Assumptions as to the validity of the intercreditor agreement_

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor_
Agreement, except for article L.626-30-2 of the French Code de Commerce which states that, in the context of
safeguard proceedings, the safeguard plan which is put to the committees of creditors takes into consideration
(prend en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between creditors which were entered into prior
to the opening of the safeguard proceedings. As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as
at the date of this offering memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a
French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency_**

Some Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Belgium (the “Belgian Guarantors”). Provided Belgium is
the territory in which the center of a Belgian Guarantor’s main interests is situated, main insolvency proceedings
may be initiated in Belgium. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian insolvency law. Under
certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets
of companies that are not established under Belgian law.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law. Belgian insolvency laws
provide for two insolvency proceedings: judicial restructuring proceedings (gerechtelijke
_reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement/faillite). Note that in_
addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation déficitaire). The latter
proceedings will not be further discussed.

_Judicial restructuring_

A debtor may (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) file a
petition for judicial restructuring if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the
future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital, the
continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk.

As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial restructuring has not issued a
ruling thereon, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. During the period between
the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be
disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may
hold with respect to such assets.

Within a period of fourteen days as from the filing of the petition and subject to the satisfaction of the filing
conditions, the court will declare the judicial restructuring procedure open, allowing a temporary moratorium for
a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated
judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to a total maximum period of twelve months as from
the initial start of the moratorium period. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business,
the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors,
the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six months.

The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to preexisting claims
in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s assets from the time that the
moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. During the duration of the moratorium,
no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial restructuring retain their conservatory
character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse
effect on the situation of the creditor concerned.

379


-----

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial restructuring
proceedings, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium (provided the receivables are pledged
specifically to that creditor from the moment the pledge is created), and the holder of such pledged receivables
is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (e.g., the
debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the
Belgian Collateral Act (Wet Financiële Zekerheden/Loi sur les Sûretés Financières) can be enforced
notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, subject to certain conditions. Personal
guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement
prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or
qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the
voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary
for the continuity of the enterprise.

During judicial restructuring proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue (in
principle) to exercise their management functions. However, upon request of the debtor or any other interested
party and to the extent it is deemed useful for reaching the aims of the restructuring, the court may appoint, in its
decision to open the judicial restructuring procedure or at any other point in time during the course of the
procedure, a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) to assist the debtor during the
restructuring. The court may also appoint a judicial administrator, upon request of any interested party or the
public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies. In
addition, in the event of manifestly gross error or manifest bad faith, a court-appointed temporary director
(voorlopig bestuurder/administrateur provisoire) may be appointed.

The restructuring procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the
initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the
early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a restructuring procedure, and
certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Subject to
certain conditions, such enforcement prohibition does not apply to close-out netting provisions. The Belgian law
on judicial restructuring provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default
that occurred prior to the restructuring procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15- day period
following the notification of such default.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during
the restructuring proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the
debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its
assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending in turn the performance of its
own obligations.

_Judicial restructuring by collective agreement, by amicable settlement or by court-ordered transfer of enterprise_

Judicial restructuring proceedings may result in an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of
its creditors or a collective agreement.

The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court
and/or third parties. In the case of an amicable settlement only, the parties to such amicable settlement will be
bound by the terms they have agreed.

In the case of a judicial restructuring by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a restructuring plan during
the restructuring procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities
and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. It must be filed with the Clerk’s Office of the
Commercial Court at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the
restructuring plan. The court needs to ratify the restructuring plan prior to it taking effect. A restructuring plan
approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court
will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not, subject to
limited exceptions. The court may refuse ratification if the conditions of the judicial restructuring act were not
met, or if the proposed restructuring plan violates public policy.

Within a period of 14 days following the ruling declaring the judicial restructuring proceedings open, the debtor
must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as recorded in the
books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing
claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the

380


-----

ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the
ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the restructuring procedure, or definitively, on
the condition that it has jurisdiction in that respect but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in
a sufficiently short time frame. In addition, the court can, upon joint request by the debtor and the creditor,
change the amount and the ranking of the claim initially declared by the debtor at the latest 15 days before the
date on which the creditors will vote on the reorganization plan. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and
the ranking of its claim at least 14 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval
of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the
purposes of the reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a restructuring plan, with the assistance of
the court-appointed administrator, as the case may be.

The court-ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or
at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who
has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in
specific circumstances.

The court-ordered transfer will be organized by one or more judicial administrators
(gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the
creditors will in most cases be limited to the transfer price.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the Public
Prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s
assets or by the liquidator of ‘main insolvency proceedings’ opened in another EU member state (other than
Denmark) in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for
bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court
for verification.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (aangifte van faillissement/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be
in a situation of cessation of payments (staking van betaling/cessation de paiements) and be unable to obtain
further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement du crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to
mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely
temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the
bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for
the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds
to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed
of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of
assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business.

The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts
existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided
the receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the
creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early
termination or acceleration event; and

- _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since
the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to
perform under such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be
performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the
bankruptcy if such decision is necessary for the management and the liquidation of the bankrupt estate. The
counterparty to an ongoing contract may summon the receiver to take a decision within 15 days. If no extension
of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if the received does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is
presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. The counterparty to that agreement may

381


-----

make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other
unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not
seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court
order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver may proceed
against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge of financial
instruments or cash held on account, falling with the scope of the Belgian Collateral Act.

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period
required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may
be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the
court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of
all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given
the opportunity to be heard by the court.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary
to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at
the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its
mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend such enforcement for a
period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of
the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be
heard by the court.

If a security, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency
proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in
accordance with the Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its
unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax administration or social security.

The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The
following is a general overview of such rules:

- Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the
so-called “estate debts,” have a senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization
and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of
the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors.

- Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether
by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

- Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for
social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the
debtor.

- _Pari passu: Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have_
been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured
creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).

**_Limitations on enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company for the obligations of another group company must
fall within the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit of the granting
company.

If the granting of a guarantee or the creation of a security interest does not fall within the grantor’s corporate
purpose, then such guarantee or security interest could, upon certain conditions, be held null and void.

The assessment of whether or not the grant of a guarantee or collateral is in each of the Belgian Guarantor’s own
corporate interest, is largely dependent on factual considerations and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis
by the board of directors or the managers of each of the Belgian Guarantors and to be reviewed ultimately on a

382


-----

case-by-case basis by the competent courts. Consideration has to be given to any actual or real benefit that such
Belgian Guarantor would actually derive from the transaction; this is particularly relevant for upstream or
cross-stream guarantees and security interests. It is generally considered by legal scholars that at least the
following principles apply to such evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the Belgian Guarantor in issuing the
guarantee must be proportional to the direct and/or indirect benefit derived from the transaction; and (ii) the
financial support granted by the Belgian Guarantor should not exceed its financial capabilities. The
responsibility for such assessment lies with the board of directors or with the managers of the Belgian
Guarantors.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the board of directors or managers of the Belgian Guarantor may
be held liable (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in
tort. Moreover, the guarantee or collateral could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the
creditor that benefits from the guarantee or collateral could be held liable on the basis of the principles of tort
liability. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate
benefit and, under certain circumstances, the creditor could be held liable for any guarantee amount in excess of
such amount. These rules have, however, seldom been tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case
law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard
market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called
“limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the
Indentures and the Security Documents will contain such limitation language and the guarantee of the Belgian
Guarantor and the security will be so limited.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture for the notes expressly provides substantially as follows:

In the case of a Belgian Guarantor, with respect to the obligations of any obligor which is not a subsidiary of
such Belgian Guarantor, its liability under the guarantee clause of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be
limited, at any time, to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greater of:

- an amount equal to 90% of such Belgian Guarantor’s net assets (as determined in accordance with
Article 617 and Article 320 of the Belgian Companies Code and accounting principles generally accepted in
Belgium, but not taking intragroup debt into account as debts) as shown by its most recent audited annual
financial statements on the date on which the relevant demand is made; and

- the aggregate amount outstanding on the date on which the relevant demand is made of (i) the principal
amount made available to such Belgian Guarantor from the proceeds of the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate
amount of any intragroup loans or facilities made to it by any group company directly and/or indirectly
using all or part of the proceeds of the Notes (whether or not such intragroup loan is retained by the Belgian
Guarantor for its own purposes or on-lent to a subsidiary of such Belgian Guarantor, but for the avoidance
of doubt excluding any intragroup loan on-lent to any other group company).

The Senior Notes Indenture expressly provides substantially as follows:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this Senior Notes Indenture may cause the aggregate
amount of a Belgian Guarantor’s liability under the Indentures with respect to the obligations of any obligor
which is not a subsidiary of such Belgian Guarantor to exceed the greater of:

- an amount equal to 90% of such Belgian Guarantor’s net assets (as determined in accordance with
Article 617 and Article 320 of the Belgian Companies Code and accounting principles generally accepted in
Belgium, but not taking intragroup debt into account as debts) as shown by its most recent audited annual
financial statements on the date on which the relevant demand is made; and

- the aggregate amount outstanding on the date on which the relevant demand is made of (i) the principal
amount made available to such Belgian Guarantor from the proceeds of the Existing Senior Secured Notes
and the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate amount of any intragroup loans or facilities made to it by any group
company directly and/or indirectly using all or part of the proceeds of the Existing Senior Secured Notes
and the Notes (whether or not such intragroup loan is retained by the Belgian Guarantor for its own
purposes or on-lent to a subsidiary of such Belgian Guarantor, but for the avoidance of doubt excluding any
intragroup loan on-lent to any other group company).

383


-----

The terms of the Security Documents granted by a Belgian Guarantor will limit enforcement to the same extent
as the payment obligations under the Belgian Guarantor’s guarantee of the Additional Notes.

384


-----

Any guarantee granted by a Belgian Guarantor shall not include and shall not extend to cover any payment
obligation in respect of the proceeds of the Notes arising out of amounts used to fund directly or indirectly the
acquisition of shares of such Belgian Guarantor to the extent that by assuming such obligation the Belgian
Guarantor would be deemed to be providing prohibited financial assistance to the acquisition of its own shares
or capital participations, as prohibited under article 329 or 629 of the Belgian Company Code. Therefore, such
payment obligations shall be excluded from the concept of guarantee by a Belgian Guarantor.

**_Financial assistance_**

Any guarantees or security interest granted by a Belgian Guarantor which constitute a breach of the provisions
on financial assistance as defined by article 329 and 629 of the Belgian Companies Code will not be
enforceable.

**_Security trustee and parallel debt_**

As there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under the present Belgian legal system, the precise
nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for
noteholders with respect to certain Belgian law collateral (other than financial collateral subject to the Belgian
Collateral Act) is debated under Belgian law. As a result, Belgian courts may not recognize the effects of any
trust provisions in relation to assets that are subject to the security and located in Belgium and held by or
granted to the Security Agent, meaning that the noteholders may have a credit risk on the Security Agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement shall provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt and
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and to applicable law, the Security Agent becomes the holder
of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor to any Secured Party under any Secured Debt Document
as and when those amounts are due. The pledges over receivables governed by Belgian law will secure the
parallel debt and may not directly secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the other
indebtedness secured by the Collateral. As a result, any noteholders that are not direct pledgees under such
pledges will have a credit risk on the Security Agent. The parallel debt procedure has not been tested under
Belgian law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by
Belgian law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the Collateral created under the parallel debt structure
are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not receive any proceeds
from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral.

However, pledge agreements over financial collateral subject to the Belgian Collateral Act (such as the shares of
Belgian companies or bank accounts) may be entered into with a representative of noteholders having the right
to enforce the pledge on behalf of the noteholders, provided that the noteholders can be identified on
enforcement.

**_Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer_**

In the event that bankruptcy proceedings are governed by Belgian law, certain transactions may be declared
ineffective against third parties if concluded or performed by the debtor during the so-called “hardening period.”

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed to
have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine,
based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such
earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where
the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the
bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of
cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The
period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the
“hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte).

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective
against third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions entered into at an undervalue or on
extremely beneficial terms for the counterparty, (ii) payments for debts which are not due (iii) payments other
than in cash for debts due, and (iv) security provided for pre-existing debts.

The Belgian bankruptcy receiver may request the court to declare payments of a Belgian Guarantor during the
hardening period for debts due ineffective against third parties, provided that it can be proven that the creditor
concerned was aware of the cessation of payment of the company. If the guarantee or security interests granted

385


-----

by a Belgian Guarantor were successfully held ineffective (based on the above), noteholders would cease to
have any claim in respect thereof and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to
such guarantee or the realization of the security. Finally, regardless of any declaration by the commercial court
of a hardening period, transactions of which it can be demonstrated that they have been entered into with
fraudulent prejudice to a third creditor, may be declared ineffective against third parties.

**_Recognition and enforcement_**

The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be subject to
validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render such security
interests invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to formalities
(e.g. judicial or non-judicial consent) and may be time consuming in the event that the foreclosure takes place
under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts may condition the enforcement of a security
interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the
foreclosure of the security interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement of security interests and/or guarantees may be
hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision
and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English
documents which they may review.

**Luxembourg**

The Senior Notes Issuer, the Luxembourg Security Providers and certain of the Guarantors (each, a
“Luxembourg Guarantor”) are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and there are assets located in
Luxembourg which are subject to security interests.

**_Insolvency_**

Accordingly, the Luxembourg District Court, sitting in commercial matters (the “Commercial Court”), should
have, in principle, jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer,
each Luxembourg Security Providers and each Luxembourg Guarantor, each entity having its registered office
and central administration (administration centrale) and “center of main interests” (centre des intérêts
_principaux) (“COMI”), as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation, in Luxembourg, such proceedings to be_
governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the place of the
registered office of a company shall be presumed to be the centre of its main interests in the absence of proof to
the contrary. As a result, there is a rebuttable presumption that the COMI (for the purposes of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Luxembourg Security Providers and Luxembourg Guarantor is
located in Luxembourg and consequently that the Commercial Court would have, in principle, jurisdiction to
open “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation), such proceedings to be
governed by Luxembourg law. However, as further explained in the “Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—_
_European Union” section, the localization of the COMI (including the COMI of the Senior Notes Issuer, the_
Luxembourg Security Providers or the Luxembourg Guarantor) is a question of fact, which may change from
time to time.

Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of proceedings (“Insolvency Proceedings”) may be
opened against the Senior Notes Issuer, a Luxembourg Security Provider or a Luxembourg Guarantor:

- bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be initiated by the Senior Notes Issuer, the
relevant Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor. The directors of the Senior Notes
Issuer, the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider or of the Luxembourg Guarantor have the compulsory
obligation to file for the opening of bankruptcy proceedings within one month in case the Senior Notes
Issuer, a Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor is in a state of cessation of payment
(cessation des paiements). Following such a request, the Commercial Court having jurisdiction may open
bankruptcy proceedings, if the Senior Notes Issuer, a Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg
Guarantor has ceased to make its payments (cessation de paiement) and has lost its credit worthiness
(ébranlement de credit). If the Commercial Court considers that these criteria are met, it may open
bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion, absent a request made by the Senior Notes Issuer, a
Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor or any of its respective creditors. The period
within which creditors must file their proofs of claims (déclarations de créances) is specified in the
judgment adjudicating the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg
Guarantor bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may nevertheless be taken into account by the

386


-----

bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to distributable proceeds. Bankruptcy proceedings are
primarily designed to realize the assets of the bankrupt entity in order to pay off its debts. One of the main
effects of such proceedings is the stay of proceedings: unsecured creditors (créanciers chirographaires) and
creditors with a general priority right (privilège général) would, as of the bankruptcy order, no longer be
permitted to take any action based on title to movable and immovable assets, nor any enforcement action
against the Senior Notes Issuer, a Luxembourg Security Provider’s or Luxembourg Guarantor’s movable or
immovable assets. Assets over which security interests have been granted will, in principle, not be available
for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).
Secured creditors who are holding security interests falling within the scope of the Luxembourg law of
August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”), may
enforce their security interests regardless of the bankruptcy adjudication. The bankruptcy receiver will
realize the Senior Notes Issuer, the Luxembourg Security Provider’s or the Luxembourg Guarantor’s assets
and distribute the proceeds to the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider’s or Luxembourg Guarantor’s
creditors in accordance with the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds lefts, to the bankrupt
Senior Notes issuer, Luxembourg Security Provider’s or Luxembourg Guarantor’s shareholders;

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée) which are governed by a grand-ducal decree of
May 24, 1935 (the “Decree”), are available to the good faith relevant Senior Notes Issuer, relevant
Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor, in the event that it no longer has
creditworthiness or is experiencing difficulties in meeting all of its commitments. The purpose of controlled
management proceedings is to assist the Senior Notes Issuer, the Luxembourg Security Providers or
Luxembourg Guarantor in reorganizing its business or in optimizing the sale of its assets under the
supervision of the Commercial Court and of court-appointed commissioners (commissaires) and with the
approval of the creditors. The opening of such proceedings may only be requested by the management of
the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider or the Luxembourg Guarantor and not
by its respective creditors. The Commercial Court first examines the request (and the evidence) filed by the
applicant to determine whether a controlled management order is justified. If the application is not
dismissed, the Commercial Court appoints one of its judges (juges délégués) to prepare a report on the
financial situation of the applicant’s business. The court order does not prevent creditors from commencing
or continuing court proceedings against the applicant, but the creditors are, as of that date, not permitted to
enforce any court judgments against the applicant. Security interests falling within the scope of the
Luxembourg Collateral Law will, however, be enforceable notwithstanding the controlled management
proceedings. As of the same judgment, the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider
or Luxembourg Guarantor may not, without the written approval of the appointed judge, dispose of its
assets, grant pledges or mortgages, make commitments or payments, enter into settlement agreements,
borrow money or receive funds. Once the report has been finalized, the Commercial Court decides whether
the application for controlled management will be granted or rejected. If the application is granted, one or
more commissioners will be appointed by the Commercial Court to prepare a reorganization or liquidation
plan. The Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider or the Luxembourg Guarantor
may not, without the commissioners’ prior approval, and under penalty of nullity of such acts, alienate any
of its assets, grant pledges or mortgages, borrow or receive any amounts of money, enter into settlement
agreements, or perform any management activity including making any commitments under any agreement,
without the formal authorization of the commissioners. The commissioners may impose measures to
preserve either the company’s interests or those of the creditors and challenge (voidance actions or
claw-back actions) transactions and payments made in violation of the creditor’s rights and in violation of
the Decree. The reorganization or liquidation plan must be accepted by a majority (representing, via their
claims which have not been challenged by the commissioner(s), at least half of the Senior Notes Issuer, the
relevant Luxembourg Security Provider’s or Luxembourg Guarantor’s liabilities) of creditors to become
binding; and

- composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the obtaining of which is requested by the
relevant good faith Senior Notes Issuer, Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor and must
be supported by proposals of composition. The composition may only be adopted if a majority of the
creditors (representing, by their unchallenged claims, three-quarters of the Senior Notes Issuer’s,
Luxembourg Security Provider’s or Luxembourg Guarantor’s liabilities) have adhered to the proposals and
if composition has been homologated by the Commercial Court. The obtaining of such composition
proceedings will trigger a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors. The composition has, in
principle, no effect on the claims secured by a mortgage, a privilege or a pledge and on claims by the tax
authorities. Composition proceedings are rarely used in practice since they are not binding upon secured
creditors.

387


-----

In addition to these proceedings, the ability to receive payments for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, the Senior Notes under
the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Note Guarantee may be affected by a decision of the Commercial
Court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant
Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire).
Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against the Senior Notes
Issuer, a Luxembourg Security Provider or a Luxembourg Guarantor pursuing an activity violating criminal
laws or which is in serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated
August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (“the Companies Act 1915”). The management of such
liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings.
Liability of the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor in
respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes (and payment under the relevant guarantees) will, in
the event of a liquidation of the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg
Guarantor following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, rank after the cost of liquidation (including
any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant
Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law.
For example, preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue (Administration des Contributions Directes);

- value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise (Administration
_de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines);_

- social security contributions; and

- remuneration owed to employees.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon
the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the
bankruptcy estate.

Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant
Luxembourg Security Provider’s or Luxembourg Guarantor’s business and assets and the relevant Luxembourg
Security Provider’s or Luxembourg Guarantor’s respective obligations under the Note Guarantees.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings
may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

**_Continuance of ongoing contracts_**

In principle, contracts of a bankrupt Senior Notes Issuer, Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg
Guarantor are not automatically terminated on commencement of bankruptcy proceedings. However, certain
contracts are terminated automatically by law, such as employment contracts, unless expressly confirmed by the
bankruptcy receiver.

The bankruptcy receiver (curateur) may decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts
(i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may decide to continue the
business of the Senior Notes Issuer, a Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor, provided that
he obtains the authorization of the Commercial Court and that such continuation does not cause any prejudice to
the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early
termination or acceleration event; and

- _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity or the solvency of the other party constitutes_
an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are generally automatically terminated as of the
bankruptcy judgment.

388


-----

In the event that the bankruptcy receiver decides to terminate a contract validly entered into by the Senior Notes
Issuer, Luxembourg Security Providers or Luxembourg Guarantor prior to the bankruptcy adjudication, the
counterparty to such contract may file a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari
_passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or initiate proceedings pertaining to a termination of the_
relevant contract. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.

**_Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer_**

Generally, payments made, as well as other transactions (listed in the pertinent section of the Luxembourg
Commercial Code) concluded or performed, during the hardening period (période suspecte) which is fixed by
the Commercial Court and dates back not more than six months as from the date on which the Commercial
Court formally adjudicates a person bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an
additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period, are subject to cancellation by the
Commercial Court upon proceedings instituted by the Luxembourg bankruptcy receiver. In particular:

- article 445 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code sets out that specific transactions entered into during the
hardening period or an additional period of ten days preceding the hardening period fixed by the
Commercial Court are null and void, if so requested by the bankruptcy receiver (e.g., the disposals by the
Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor of movable and
immovable assets without consideration or with inadequate consideration; payments whether in cash or by
way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means for non-matured debts; payments that have not been
in cash or by way of negotiable and non-negotiable papers for matured debts and the granting of security
interests for antecedent debts (save for financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the
Luxembourg Collateral Law));

- article 446 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code provides that the bankruptcy receiver may challenge and
initiate nullity actions in the following events: (i) payments made for matured debts for considerations and
(ii) other transactions realized during the hardening period, if the contracting party has knowledge of the
cessation of payments;

- article 447 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code provides that the bankruptcy receiver may challenge and
initiate nullity actions against mortgages and privileges that have been granted either ten days prior to or
after the date of the cessation of payments if more than 15 days have elapsed between the granting of the
mortgage or privilege and its registration; and

- regardless of the hardening period, article 448 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and article 1167 of the
Luxembourg Civil Code (actio pauliana) give the court-appointed bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of
the creditors) the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the bankruptcy,
without limitation of time.

Pursuant to article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, notwithstanding the hardening period as referred to
in articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, where a financial collateral arrangement has
been entered into after the opening of a liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization
measures or the entry into force of such measures, such an arrangement is valid and binding against third
parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs, if the collateral taker proves
that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or
that it could not be aware of it.

**_Limitation on enforcement of security interests_**

According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae
or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated)
in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence,
Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over
assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies or
bearer shares issued by Luxembourg companies and physically located in Luxembourg, bank accounts held with
a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in
Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in
Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

389


-----

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be
governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law.
The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over
registered shares in Luxembourg companies or bearer shares in Luxembourg companies physically located in
Luxembourg, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the
Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and
acceptance requirements. A share pledge agreement over registered shares in a Luxembourg company must be
(i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the security interest)
and/or (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future registered shares are pledged, the
perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A
pledge over shares issued in bearer form (deposited with a depositary in accordance with article 42 of the
Companies Act 1915) in a Luxembourg company will have to be registered by the depositary in the register of
the bearer shares issued by such Luxembourg company (kept by the depositary in accordance with article 42 of
the Companies Act 1915) in the name of the pledgee. If future shares issued in bearer form are pledged, the
perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the register of the bearer shares issued by the
Luxembourg company in which the shares are pledged. A pledge over receivables becomes enforceable against
the debtor of the receivables and third parties from the moment when the agreement pursuant to which the
pledge was created is entered into between the pledgor and the pledgee. However, if the debtor has not been
notified of the pledge or if it did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, it will be validly discharged if
he pays the pledgor. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank. In
addition, the account bank has to waive any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the
relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional
notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank. Until such registrations, notifications and
acceptances occur, the receivables pledge agreements / the bank account pledge agreements are not effective and
perfected (as applicable) against the debtors, the account banks and other third parties. Article 11 of the
Luxembourg Collateral Law sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement
event, including, but not limited to:

- appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined
in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) (if listed) the listing price of the
pledged assets;

- sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially reasonable terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (if listed shares), or (iii) by
way of a public auction;

- court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

- set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method
chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve
third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests
might be substantially delayed.

The Luxembourg Collateral Law expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges)
including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during the hardening period,
against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies
irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors
or reorganization affecting any one of the parties.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable
in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/ arrangements, which are
not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be
recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside of Luxembourg, in
particular where the relevant Luxembourg Security Provider or Luxembourg Guarantor becomes subject to
Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of
the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as
defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security

390


-----

interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU
Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance with article 5 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

In this respect, the enforceability of the first ranking assignment over some of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
rights under the Covenant Agreement Assignment or the enforceability of the pledges over each Escrow
Account granted by the Temporary Notes Issuer cannot be entirely ascertained in a Luxembourg insolvency
situation affecting the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Temporary Notes Issuer. While the Luxembourg
Collateral Law recognizes the validity and enforceability of outright transfers of title to “assets” (which are
defined as financial instruments and claims, together, the “Collateral Law Assets”) against third parties,
administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the existence of a
reorganization measure, liquidation proceedings or the occurrence of any competing claims between creditors,
whether located in Luxembourg or not, it is untested and legally questionable whether assets transferred by way
of security (as contemplated by the first ranking assignment or the pledges over the Escrow Accounts) (other
than the Collateral Law Assets) would benefit from the provisions of the Luxembourg Collateral Law.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party
creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests
created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek
the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges
will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by
operation of law).

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by
operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured
or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes, in
particular, the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of
employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (namely
social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This
general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.
Finally, the appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent
that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions.
Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, a security (financial collateral) may
be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure
the claims of third party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third party beneficiaries are
determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third party beneficiaries of the
security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the
same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by such law.

**_Limitation on luxembourg guarantors’ guarantees and security_**

The Companies Act 1915 does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to
guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. It is generally held that within a group of
companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity should, to a certain extent, be tempered by,
and subordinated to, the interest of the group. A reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does
not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary,
in proportion with the real financial means of the assisting company or have a reciprocal character. A company
may give a guarantee provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate objects and is
in the best interest of the company. The test regarding the guarantor’s corporate interest is whether the company
that provides the guarantee receives some consideration in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit)
and whether the benefit is proportional to the burden of the assistance. A guarantee that substantially exceeds
the guarantor company’ ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other
creditors would expose its directors or managers to personal liability. Furthermore, under certain circumstances,
the directors of the Luxembourg company might incur criminal penalties based on the concept of
misappropriation of corporate assets (article 171-1 of the Companies Act 1915). The guarantees granted by the
Luxembourg Guarantors will be limited to 90% of, among others, the relevant company’s net worth in
accordance with the provisions set out in the relevant Indentures.

A guarantee granted by a Luxembourg company could, if submitted to a Luxembourg court, depending on the
terms of such guarantee, possibly be construed by such court as a suretyship (cautionnement) and not a demand
guarantee or an independent guarantee. Article 2012 of the Luxembourg Civil Code provides that the validity
and the enforceability of a suretyship (which constitutes an accessory obligation) is subject to the validity of the

391


-----

underlying obligation. It follows that if the underlying obligations were invalid or challenged, it cannot be
excluded that the Luxembourg Guarantor would be released from its liabilities under the guarantee.

**_Financial assistance_**

Any guarantees or security interests granted by Luxembourg companies that constitute a breach of the
provisions on financial assistance as defined by article 49-6 of the Companies Act 1915 might not be
enforceable.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the Notes, the Security Documents, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior
Notes Indenture and the Note Guarantees (and any other document in connection therewith) with the
_Administration de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines in Luxembourg may be required in the case of legal_
proceedings before Luxembourg courts or in the case that the Notes, the Security Documents, the Existing
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Note Guarantees (and any other document
in connection therewith) must be produced before an official Luxembourg authority (autorité constituée) or in
the case that the Notes, the Security Documents, the Indenture and the Note Guarantees (and any other
document in connection therewith) are referred to in a public deed. In such case, either a nominal registration
duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the
document so registered) will be payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad
_valorem duty is payable in respect of Security Documents that are subject to the Luxembourg Collateral law._

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the Notes, the Security
Documents, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Note Guarantees
(and any other document in connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated
into French or German.

**Plan of distribution**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Senior Secured Notes Purchase
_Agreement”) dated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Temporary Senior Secured Notes Issuer_
agreed to sell to each Senior Secured Notes Initial Purchaser and each such Senior Secured Notes Initial
Purchasers agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Temporary Senior Secured Notes from the
Temporary Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Senior Notes Purchase Agreement”,
together with the Senior Secured Notes Purchase Agreement, the “Purchase Agreements”) dated as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum, the Temporary Senior Notes Issuer agreed to sell to each Senior Notes Initial
Purchaser and each such Senior Notes Initial Purchasers agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the
Temporary Senior Notes from the Temporary Senior Notes Issuer.

The Purchase Agreements provide that the obligations of the relevant Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Temporary Senior Secured Notes or Temporary Senior Notes, as applicable, are subject to,
among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The relevant Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Temporary Senior Secured Notes and the Temporary Senior
Notes initially at the prices indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and
other selling terms of the Temporary Notes may from time to time be varied by the relevant Initial Purchasers
without notice.

We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees or discounts for their services in
connection with the Offerings and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreements provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless the relevant Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the relevant Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain
limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
Purchase Agreements, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, us during the period from the date of the
Purchase Agreements through and including the date 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreements.

The Temporary Notes, the Additional Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes and the Note Guarantees have not
been registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell
the Notes (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with Rule 144A, and
(ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed with us that:

(i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Temporary Notes in
circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us, and

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Temporary Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the
Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Temporary Notes, the Senior Notes or the
Additional Senior Secured Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or
any other material relating to us or the Temporary Notes, the Senior Notes or the Additional Senior Secured
Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Temporary Notes, the
Senior Notes or the Additional Senior Secured Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and
neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the
Temporary Notes, the Senior Notes or the Additional Senior Secured Notes may be distributed or published, in

393


-----

or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such
country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an
offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the Offerings, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See
“Notice to Investors.”

The Temporary Senior Notes were a new issue of securities for which there currently was no market.

The relevant Initial Purchasers advised us that they intended to make a market for the Temporary Senior
Secured Notes and the Temporary Senior Notes, as applicable, as permitted by applicable law after completing
the Offerings. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Temporary Senior
Secured Notes or the Temporary Secured Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any
time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity
will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Following the
exchange of Temporary Notes for Additional Notes, we cannot assure you that any market for the Additional
Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will
be able to sell any Additional Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes at a particular time or at a price which will
be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—There may not be an active trading
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

Delivery of the Temporary Notes was made against payment on the Temporary Notes on March 10, 2015, which
was ten business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following
the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the
U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless
the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wished to trade the
Temporary Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next six business days were required to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of
the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offerings, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Additional Senior Secured Notes or the
Senior Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase
Additional Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Additional
Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also
over allot the Offerings, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Additional Senior
Secured Notes or Senior Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the
Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Additional Senior Secured Notes
or Senior Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose
penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Additional Senior
Secured Notes or Senior Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not
required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be
given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Additional Senior Secured or Senior Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which_
_case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.” Additionally, the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates have_
committed to provide bridge financing in connection with the financing of the Acquisition in the event that the
Offerings are not consummated.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment
banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to the Issuers and their affiliates in the ordinary
course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, affiliates of each of the Initial
Purchasers act as mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. Natixis also acts as
facility agent under the Revolving Credit Facility. Each has received and will receive customary fees for their
services in such capacities.

**Service of process and enforcement of civil liabilities**

The Senior Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg, and the Temporary Notes Issuers were
organized under the law of Luxembourg. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of
France. Each of the Security Documents relating to the Collateral will be governed by the laws of France,
Belgium and Luxembourg, as applicable. The Indentures (including the Senior Secured Note Guarantees) and
Senior Notes and the Additional Senior Secured Notes is governed by New York law. The Intercreditor
Agreement will be governed by the law of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of
each of the Issuers and each of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since substantially all of
the assets of each of the Issuers and each of the Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive officers, are
located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against either of the Issuers or a
Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if
any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S.
Federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although each of the
Issuers and each of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will
submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the
Notes and the Indentures or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of
process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including
actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against either of the Issuers or a Guarantor or a security provider,
investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even
though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries
in which each of the Issuers and the Guarantors is located, you should consult with your own advisors in any
pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**France**

Our French counsel has advised us that the United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and
commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States,
would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in
France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such
matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied
that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include
a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

- such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is
clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction
over the matter;

- such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

- such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions
(i.e. those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, and that such U.S.
judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France.
Where proceedings are pending before French Courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought
and where these proceedings have the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment, the courts may stay
the exequatur proceedings.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res
_judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in_

397


-----

France after all remedies have been exhausted. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to
appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of
July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in
connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities
would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or
French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and
individual liberties, as most recently modified by French Ordinance No. 2011 1012 of August 24, 2011) can
limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in
connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, we have been advised by our French counsel that if an original action is brought in France, French
courts may refuse to apply foreign law or a part of foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of
conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the
case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis
by French courts) or in case of overriding mandatory rules. Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the
basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the
remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a
foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the
foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French persons. Pursuant to
Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in
connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the
foreign claimant (Article 15). These provisions also apply in the context of non-contractual obligations. For a
long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or
defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However,
according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an
action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the
choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. More specifically, according to this recent case law, a French defendant
can no longer challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal on the basis of article 15 of the French civil code in
circumstances where the foreign tribunal has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, French and foreign claimants
may respectively waive their rights respectively to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the
French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one
party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any
competent jurisdiction was invalid on the ground that it was discretionary (potestative). Accordingly, any
provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Belgium**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Belgium is based
upon advice provided to us by our Belgian legal advisors. Final and enforceable judgments rendered by U.S.
courts can be declared enforceable (granting “exequatur”) in Belgium according to the procedure set out in
Articles 22 et seq. of the Belgian Code of International Private Law (Wetboek van Internationaal
_Privaatrecht/Code de droit international privé) (formal “exequatur” proceedings before a Belgian court) and_
_provided that, pursuant to Article 24 of the same Code, the following documents are produced in court by the_
claimant seeking enforcement:

- an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all
conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

398


-----

- if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating
process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law; and

- any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has
been notified to the defendant.

However, the court will refuse enforcement in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of
International Private Law and notably, if, among other things:

- the consequences of the recognition or enforcement of such foreign decision would be manifestly contrary
to Belgian public policy;

- the rights of defense were not respected;

- the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets in such state
without any further connection with the litigation in such state;

- without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law of 16 July 2004, the
judgment is not final or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the laws of the State
where the judgment was rendered or the applicable federal rules;

- if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought
with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian
conflict of law rules;

- the decision is in conflict with either a decision rendered in Belgium or a decision previously rendered in
another state and such decision can be recognized in Belgium;

- the claim was introduced before the courts of such state after a claim, which is still pending and relating to
the same matter and between the same parties, was introduced in a Belgian court;

- the Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the claim; or

- the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to
insolvency proceedings or corporate standing.

Note that the foreign judgment for which enforcement is sought will not be reviewed on the merits.

**Luxembourg**

Foreign judgments need to obtain an exequatur by a Luxembourg court before they can be enforced by a bailiff
(huissier de justice).

As there is no treaty in force on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters between the United States and Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will not automatically
recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. A valid, final and conclusive judgment
rendered by a U.S. court against (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with respect to the Additional Senior
Secured Notes, (ii) the Temporary Senior Secured Notes Issuer in respect of the Temporary Senior Secured
Notes, (iii) the Temporary Senior Notes Issuer in respect of the Temporary Senior Notes, (iv) the Senior Notes
Issuer in respect of the Senior Notes or (v) the Luxembourg Guarantors in respect of the Note Guarantees needs
to obtain an exequatur by a Luxembourg District Court (Tribunal d’arrondissement) before it can be enforced
by a bailiff. The Luxembourg ordinary law principles (droit commun), that will be applicable to grant an
_exequatur of such U.S. court order, have been determined by case law on the basis of articles 678 et seq. of the_
Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procédure Civile). The following conditions
must be met:

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under its
applicable laws, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law;

- the U.S. court order or judgment must not result from an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi);

- the judgment is final and enforceable in the jurisdiction where the decision is rendered (exécutoire);

399


-----

- the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules
(according to recent Luxembourg case law, Luxembourg courts do not have to verify this condition
anymore);

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

- the judgment was granted following proceedings where the defendant had the opportunity to appear, and if
appeared, to present a defense; and

- the consideration of the foreign order as well as the judgment does not contravene international public
policy as understood under the laws of Luxembourg, nor has it been given in proceedings of a criminal or
tax nature.

Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility may change:
additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other conditions may not be
verified by Luxembourg courts in the future.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg,
without prejudice to conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law if: (i) the
choice of such law was not made bona fide or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or if pleaded
and proved, the foreign law was contrary to Luxembourg mandatory provisions (lois imperatives) or
incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S.
federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies
sought. While, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give
a judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro, enforcement of the judgment against any
party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be
converted into euro.

To the Chairman,

In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Cerba European Lab and in compliance with your request, we have
reviewed the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cerba European Lab for the
period from January 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. (“the financial statements”).

The management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these “financial statements”. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our review.

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. A review of interim
financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an
audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not
enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim
condensed consolidated “financial statements” are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
IAS 34—the standard of IFRS as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information.

This report is governed by French law. French courts have exclusive jurisdiction to judge any dispute, claim or
disagreement that may result from our letter of engagement or this report or any related question. Each party
irrevocably renounces his or her rights to oppose legal action brought before these courts, to contend that the
action was brought before a court that was not competent, or that these courts do not have jurisdiction.

**6.3** **Basis of preparation**

**6.3.1 Statement of compliance**

The interim consolidated financial statements at 30 September 2014 were prepared in accordance with IAS 34—
Interim Financial Information. They correspond to condensed interim financial statements and do not include all
the information required for annual financial statements. The interim consolidated financial statements at
30 September 2014 are to read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group published
on 31 December 2013.

The accounting policies applied by the Group to establish the interim consolidated financial statements at
September 30, 2014, are similar to those applied by the Group at 31 December 2013, with the exception of the
following standards applicable from 1 January 2014, and comply with International Financial Reporting

F-12


-----

Standards (IFRS) as approved by the European Union. These accounting principles are described in the
“Significant Accounting Policy” of consolidated financial statements 2013.

The Group has analysed IFRSs, IASs, SIC, IFRIC interpretations and related amendments published, approved
and applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014—as well as those not yet
approved—by the European Union at 30 September 2014.

These standards can be viewed on the European Commission’s website at:
_http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm_

The following standards, interpretations and related amendments, published in the Official Journal of the
European Union at the end of the reporting period, were applied by the Group in 2014.

**Revised standards, amendments and interpretations applicable for accounting periods beginning on or**
**after 1 January 2014**

The new accounting standards and interpretations listed below were applied by the Group for the first time in
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2014.

- Amendment to IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.” IAS 28 was amended to conform to
changes made after the issuance of IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”, IFRS 11 “Joint
Arrangements” and IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”;

- Amendments to IAS 32 “Overview: offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities” clarifies meaning of
“must have an enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts” and that some systems overall
compensation can be considered equivalent to a settlement based on the net. This amendment was adopted
by the European Union December 29, 2012 and must be applied retrospectively for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2014;

- Amendments to IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets—Information on non recoverable amount of non-active
Financial “. These amendments were adopted by the European Union December 19, 2013 and are
applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2014;

- Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 9 Novation derivatives and maintaining the hedge accounting. these
amendments were adopted by the European Union December 19, 2013 and are applicable to financial years
beginning on or after 1 January 2014;

- IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”;

- IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” replaces IAS 31 “Interests in Joint Ventures” and SIC—13 “Entities jointly
controlled entities—Non-monetary Contributions by Venturers “;

- IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”. The objective of IFRS 12 is to require information that
enables users of financial statements to evaluate the basis of control, any restrictions on consolidated assets
and liabilities, risk exposures arising from investments in unconsolidated structured entities and the
participation of minority interests in the activities of the entities consolidated.
The analysis conducted by the Group on its investments, and over all the periods presented, showed that the new
definition of control given by IFRS 10 does not change the scope of consolidation.
The Other standards are no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

**New standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB but not yet applicable or not**
**early-adopted by the Group:**

The new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the EU European,
are:

- _Standards:_

F-13


-----

     - IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” effective from January 1, 2015 and not yet adopted by the EU
European;

     - IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts (issued on 30 January 2014)

     - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued on 28 May 2014)

     - IFRIC 21 “Duties and Taxes”, adopted by the European Union on June 2014, which are applicable
to periods beginning from 1 July 2014

- _Amendments:_

     - Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its
Associate or Joint Venture (issued on 11 September 2014)

     - Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (issued on 12 August
2014)

     - Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41: Bearer Plants (issued on 30 June 2014)

     - Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and
Amortisation (issued on 12 May 2014)

     - Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (issued on
6 May 2014)

     - Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19) (issued on 21 November
2013)

The Group is currently analysing the impact on its consolidated financial statements of the standards published
by the IASB at 30 September 2014 but not yet adopted by the EU but it does not expect the impact to be
material.

**6.3.2 Comparability of financial statements**

The accounting policies used to prepare the interim consolidated financial statements at 30 September 2014 are
identical to those used for the interim consolidated statements at 30 September 2013.

As part of a consolidated reporting optimization process, it was made in 2014 some reclassifications and
refining in terms of accounting position in the income statement.

These changes include the lines “Consumption of materials and supplies” and “Other purchases and external
expenses but have no major effect on the aggregates of our financial statements.

**6.3.3 Basis of measurement**

The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost principle, except for
derivative instruments, which are measured at fair value.

**6.3.4 Functional and presentation currency**

The interim consolidated financial statements are presented in Thousands of Euros, the Company’s functional
currency, and rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise specified.

**6.3.5 Use of estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amount of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.

F-14


-----

Management bases these estimates and assumptions on past experience and the Group’s current business
environment and they are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The impacts of changes to estimates are recognised in
the period in which the estimates are revised and for all future periods affected.

Estimates and assumptions are particularly important for measuring:

- the recoverable amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, especially goodwill
presented in notes 6.11, 6.12 and 6.13;

- obligations under defined benefit plans;

- deferred tax assets and liabilities.

**(In thousands of euro)** **30 September 2014** **30 September 2013**
Current tax expense ............................................................................. (13,767) (11,158)
Deferred tax expense ........................................................................... 2,619 1,809
**Income tax ..........................................................................................** **(11,148)** **(9,349)**

The current tax expense is equal to the amount of income taxes due to tax authorities for the year, according to
the tax regulations and legal tax rates in the different countries.

The base rate of theoretical income tax in France is 34.43%, including the additional contributions.

In September 2014, the theoretical income tax, calculated by multiplying consolidated income before tax by the
standard French corporate income tax rate, represented an expense of € −5,4 Million, compared with actual
income tax expense of € −11,1 million. The difference between these two amounts can be explained mainly as
follows:

- Impact of permanent differences of € −2,4 million corresponding to the Tax effect of untaxed income and
income taxed at a different rate (€ −1,3 million), IAS39 restatements impacts(€ −1,7 million), and to the tax
effect on other permanent differences (€ 0,6 million);

- Taxes with no tax base (CVAE) of € −1,1 million;

- Deferred tax assets unrecognized on tax losses of € −2,3 million.

This note breaks down Group borrowings by type of instrument, notably the refinancing operation referred to in
Note 6.2.

Financial liabilities comprise several different types of debt and equity instruments and bank borrowings in line
with the Group’s policy of diversifying its sources of financing.

On September 30[th] 2014, the financial instruments aren’t significant in the consolidated accounts of the Group.

Financing arrangements set up when the Group was created were as follows:

- Convertible and non-convertible bonds, most of which bear interest at 10%, maturing on 21 July 2025. The
Interests are capitalised annually. The majority of convertible bonds were converted into shares following
the decision of the General Shareholders’ Meeting of 11 December 2012 to increase the share capital of the
holding company.

- Existing loans at 31 January 2012 were refinanced by the high- yield bonds issued on 31 January 2013 and
by the additional draw (see Note 6.2).

- The Group has also received financing from its shareholders in the form of non-convertible bonds.

The Group’s subsidiaries have local medium-term credit facilities.

**6.19.2 Debts covenants**

The main financial liabilities are subject to certain conditions applied to the consolidated financial statements
and notably the ratio of net debt to gross operating profit (or EBITDA).

Following the refinancing operation of January 2013, new debt covenants were negotiated with the Group’s
banks, replacing the pre-existing covenants (see Notes 6.2).

As part of its Revolving Credit Facility, the Group is bound by two new covenants calculated based on the
consolidated accounts: Leverage ratio (Consolidated Total Net Debt / Consolidated proforma EBITDA) and
Percentage Test (contribution of the loan guarantors to consolidated EBITDA and consolidated assets).

**6.20** **Employee benefits**

**(In thousands of euro)** **30 September 2014** **31 December 2013**
Defined benefits plan............................................................................. 5,889 4,495

_Employee benefit obligations................................................................._ _6,986_ _5,618_
_Plan assets............................................................................................._ _(478)_ _(478)_

In certain countries, Group employees are entitled to supplementary pension plans into which the Group pays
annual contributions, and lump sum retirement indemnities paid out once the employees retire. These take the
form of either defined contribution or defined benefit plans.

Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make further
contributions and the corresponding expense is recognised in profit or loss for the period. All defined benefit
plans concern France.

Assumptions used in calculating the provision for retirement and similar benefits have only to do with France
and are the same as December 2013

**6.20.1 Actuarial assumptions**

All of the Group’s various employee benefit obligations are regularly reviewed by actuaries in accordance with
IFRS standards using the projected unit credit method based on salaries at retirement.

All actuarial gains and losses and adjustments relating to the limitation are recognised in the reporting period in
which they occur in accordance with Revised IAS 19.

F-26


-----

Actuarial assumptions (i.e., the probability that active employees will continue to work in the Group, mortality
rates, retirement age, assumptions regarding future salary increases, etc.) depend on the demographic and
economic conditions in the countries in which the different plans have been set up.

Discount rates used to determine the present value of benefit obligations are based either on the government
bond rate or on the yield on investment grade corporate bonds that are traded in an active market with maturities
that match the duration of the benefit obligation. In the eurozone, discount rates have been calculated on
software developed by independent actuaries.

Assumptions used in calculating the provision for retirement and similar benefits have only to do with France
and are the same as December 2013

**Cerba European Lab**

**Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements**
For the year ended December 31, 2013

To the Shareholders

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your article of association and your annual general
meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2013, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of CERBA EUROPEAN LAB

- the justification of our assessments,

- the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. Our role is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

**1 Opinion on the consolidated financial statements**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling
techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of
the financial position of the group at December 31, 2013 and of the results of its operations for the year then
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**2 Justification of our assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce)
relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matter:

**_Accounting estimate_**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, your company is required to make a number of estimates and
assumptions that affect the value of certain assets and liabilities, expense and revenue items. The accounting
estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 are described
in the note 6.3.5 “Use of estimates and judgments” to the consolidated financial statements.

In particular your company performed impairment tests on goodwill as of December 31, 2013 based on the
methods described in the notes 6.4.3.1 and 6.12 “Goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements. We have
reviewed the methods used to carry out these impairment tests as well as the corresponding assumptions applied
by your company in order to determine the values in use and we have verified that the notes to the consolidated
financial statements provide appropriate disclosure.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and
therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

**3 Specific verification**

As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified
the information presented in the group’s management report.

F-33

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial
statements.

**6 Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**General informations**

**6.1** **Reporting entity**

Cerba European Lab (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) is a French simplified joint-stock company
(société par actions simplifiée) with a Management Board and Supervisory Board, headquartered in France at
7/11 Rue de l’Equerre 95310 Saint- Ouen-l’Aumône.

The Company was created on 8 June 2010 following the acquisition of the Cerba European Lab Group.

The Group is a leading European player in medical biology, with a market positioning in clinical laboratory
testing, specialised clinical pathology and clinical trials.

Financière Gaillon 13 SAS was created in 2013 and is the main shareholder of Cerba European Lab.

**6.2** **Significant events of the period**

**_Changes in scope of consolidation_**

The Group continued its policy of external growth. It acquired the following interests during the year
(see Note 6.12):

- Laboratoire Bionord (100%) on 1 June 2013;

- Laboratoire CHB (Chaouat Heurzeau Bieder) (99.98%) on 30 June 2013;

- Laboratoire CBM (Centre de Biologie Médicale) (99.97%), consolidated beginning 20 December 2013;

- SCM BIO76 (99.51%) on 20 December 2013;

The Group is restructuring its operations as follows:

- Mergers by dissolution without liquidation and transfer of all assets and liabilities (Transmission
Universelle de Patrimoine) in France of:

   - Biocreat and Gendrault to CBCV from 1 January 2013

   - GD Bio to CBCV from 30 April 2013

   - Bionord, LABM La Plaine de Cafres and LABM La Petite Ile to Bioreunion on 1 August 2013,
1 September 2013 and 1 July 2013, respectively

**_Financing structure_**

On 31 January 2013, the Group completed a successful issue of €365 million worth of 7% high-yield bonds
maturing in February 2020 with coupon payable twice yearly in February and August, beginning in
August 2013. Arrangement fees and the related legal fees for the operation totalled €5.5 million and €10 million,
respectively.

On 31 January 2013, the Group successfully negotiated a “super senior” revolving line of credit of €50 million
which it used to refinance debt issued in July 2010 (senior bank loan and mezzanine debt) and unwind the
positions it had contracted on the related interest rate swaps. The fees for arranging this facility totalled
€1.9 million and they have been amortised over the term of the loan using the effective interest method in
accordance with IAS 39 (see Note 6.4.2.3).

As the Group had considered it highly probably that it would repay this debt early in January 2013, it had
already amortised total deferred borrowing costs using the same effective interest method in 2012.

On the same date, the Group paid down debt for a total amount of €313.6 million, comprising €247 million for a
senior bank loan, €61.9 million of mezzanine debt and €4.7 million to unwind interest rate swaps.

On 31 January 2013, Cerberus Nightingale 2 SA transferred its convertible bonds and shareholders loans onto
the books of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Financiere Gaillon 13 SAS.

**6.3** **Basis of preparation**

**6.3.1 Statement of compliance**

The consolidated financial statements of Cerba European Lab have been prepared in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (including IFRSs, IASs, SIC and IFRIC interpretations) adopted by
the European Union before 31 December 2013 and published by the IASB (International Accounting Standards
Board).

-----

**6.3.2 Comparability of financial statements**

The accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2013 are identical
to those used for the consolidated statements at 31 December 2012 with the following exception:

- the CICE (Crédit d’Impôt Compétitivité et de l’Emploi), the French tax credit designed to boost
competitiveness and employment introduced on 1 January 2013 and applicable to the Group’s French
entities, is recognised in Personnel expenses in accordance with the provisions of Revised IAS 19.

**6.3.3 Basis of measurement**

The annual consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost principle, except for
derivative instruments, which are measured at fair value.

**6.3.4 Functional and presentation currency**

The annual consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, the Company’s functional
currency, and rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise specified.

**6.3.5 Use of estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.

Management bases these estimates and assumptions on past experience and the Group’s current business
environment and they are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The impacts of changes to estimates are recognised in
the period in which the estimates are revised and for all future periods affected.

Estimates and assumptions are particularly important for measuring:

- the recoverable amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, especially goodwill
(assumptions presented in notes 6.4.3.1 and 6.12);

- obligations under defined benefit plans (assumptions presented in note 6.23);

- deferred tax assets and liabilities (see note 6.16).

**6.4** **Significant accounting policies**

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated
financial statements and by all Group entities.

**6.4.1 Basis of consolidation**

The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements include those of the parent company and all of its
subsidiaries for the period ended 31 December 2013. All of the subsidiaries close their accounts on
31 December, except for LBS (30 September) and CRI (30 November).

The Group consolidates all entities over which it exercises exclusive control—either directly or indirectly—
using the full consolidation method. Entities over which the Group has significant influence are accounted for
using the equity method without applying any threshold in terms of its interest and/or voting rights.

All material intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses are totally eliminated.

All profits and losses generated by subsidiaries are broken out into the portion attributable to owners of the
Company and to non-controlling interests, based on their respective interests.

F-44


-----

**_6.4.1.1 Business combinations_**

In accordance with Revised IFRS 3, business combinations acquired after to 1 January 2010 are accounted for
using the purchase method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control was transferred to
the Group.

The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

- the fair value of the consideration transferred; (+)

- the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; (+)

- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the
acquiree; (−)

- the net recognised amount (in general the fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.

Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is subsequently adjusted through
goodwill only when additional information is obtained after the acquisition date about facts and circumstances
that existed at that date.

Such adjustments are made only during the 12-month measurement period that follows the acquisition date.

All other subsequent adjustments are recorded as a receivable or payable through profit or loss.

In the case of multi-step acquisitions, acquisition of control over the acquiree triggers remeasurement of all
previously-held equity interests at fair value and any material changes are recognised in profit or loss from
recurring operations.

Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Contingent consideration is recognised in equity if the contingent payment is settled by delivery of a fixed
number of the acquirer’s equity instruments; in all other cases, it is recognised in liabilities related to business
combinations. Contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the
probability of payment. If the contingent consideration was originally recognised as a liability, any subsequent
adjustments are recognised in profit or loss unless such adjustments are made within 12 months of the
acquisition date and are related to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Purchased goodwill is
accounted for as a business combination.

**_6.4.1.2 Acquisitions of non-controlling interests_**

Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as
owners. Therefore, no goodwill is recognised. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions
that do not involve the loss of control are determined based on the proportionate interest in the net assets of
the subsidiary.

Operations that do not lead to a loss of control are treated as transactions between shareholders, giving rise to a
new split between equity attributable to owners of the Company and to non-controlling interests. The same
allocation basis is applied to any transaction costs.

**_6.4.1.3 Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

French legislation requires laboratories to be incorporated as private practice companies (Société d’Exercice
_Libéral—SEL) and the clinical pathologists operating the private practice companies to hold at least 50% of the_

voting rights at shareholders’ annual general meetings. In strict compliance with these regulations, the Group
has created a capital structure to meet these obligations and hold the majority of the related financial interests
(see Note 6.5). Moreover, specific clauses, especially concerning the governance structure, are included in the
articles of association and shareholders agreements.

Although the Group does not hold the majority of voting rights in the private practice companies, the
above-mentioned mechanisms allow it to obtain the majority of the economic benefits derived from the
activities of these companies and also to demonstrate the existence of de facto control in full compliance with
French legislation, therefore enabling the French entities to be fully consolidated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases
(see Note 6.4.1.4). Divestment resulting in loss of control.

**_6.4.1.4 Disvestment resulting in loss of control_**

Upon loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling
interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any profit or loss arising on the loss of
control is recognised in “Profit or loss from recurring operations”.

If the Group retains any interest in its former subsidiary, said interest is measured at fair value at the date that
control is relinquished. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an availablefor-sale financial asset, depending on the level of influence retained.

**_6.4.1.5 Transactions eliminated in consolidation_**

Intra-group balances and transactions and any income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are
eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

**_6.4.1.6 Foreign currency transactions_**

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies of the respective
Group entities at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the closing exchange rate.

Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in profit or loss.

**_6.4.1.7 Foreign operations_**

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations—including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisitions—whose functional currency is not the euro, are translated into euros at the closing exchange rate,
and their statements of comprehensive income are translated into euros using average exchange rates for
the period.

The foreign currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognised in
“Other comprehensive income”. They are carried in the foreign currency translation reserve in consolidated
equity until the related investments are sold or wound up.

**6.4.2 Financial instruments**

**_6.4.2.1 Definitions_**

The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are presented in accordance with IAS 39.

They are broken out into their current and non-current portion, depending on whether they mature in under or
over one year.

In accordance with IAS 39, the obligating event is recognition in the balance sheet at the transaction date: if
there is a time-lag between the transaction date (i.e., the obligation) and the settlement date, securities
deliverable or receivable are recognised from the transaction date.

F-46


-----

**_6.4.2.2 Non-derivative financial assets_**

The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date they originated.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or
it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is
created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position
when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Factoring contract_

Receivables assigned to third parties under factoring agreements are derecognised when substantially all of the
risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to these third parties and, more particularly, when the factoring
company bears the risks of non-recoverability and late payment.

_Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and
subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash on hand, amounts invested in money market funds and
negotiable debt instruments, readily convertible into known amounts of cash, and subject to insignificant interest
rate risk exposure. They do not include bank overdraft facilities.

**_6.4.2.3 Non-derivative financial liabilities_**

The Group initially recognises debt securities and subordinated liabilities on the date they originated.

Financial liabilities consist of borrowings and debt, in accordance with IAS 39.

Loans whose contractual rate of interest is tied to the Group’s business data are deemed to be at a fixed rate
(at the effective interest rate calculated at the inception of the loan).

In the event of a change in the underlying data used to calculate the effective interest rate, the carrying amount
of the loan is adjusted with a matching entry to finance costs.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations have been discharged, cancelled
or expired.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities as other financial liabilities. Such financial liabilities are
recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently
remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other payables.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

F-47


-----

**_6.4.2.4 Share capital_**

_Ordinary shares_

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity,
net of any tax effect.

_Preference shares_

Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable, or redeemable at the Company’s
discretion only, and the distribution of any dividends is also discretionary. Dividends thereon are deducted
directly from equity once they have been approved by the Company’s shareholders at their general meeting.

All of the preference shares issued by the Group meet the definition of equity instruments.

_Share-based payment_

On 21 July 2010, the Company issued shares with warrants to senior executives and some Group employees.

The issue was recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as a share-based payment and the warrants were measured
at fair value on the grant date.

The fair value of stock options is based on the exercise price and the expected life of the option; the price of the
underlying stock at the grant date; the expected volatility in the share price; forecast dividends; and the risk-free
interest rate over the life of the option.

This method results in a fair value of warrants that is equal to their issue price. The shares with warrants have
therefore been classified as equity at their issue cost. Since the issue price is equal to the grant-date fair value,
the corresponding expense in the income statement is nil.

**_6.4.2.5 Hybrid financial instruments_**

Hybrid financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible bonds denominated in euros that can be
converted into a fixed number of shares.

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar
liability that does not have a conversion option, by discounting the contractual cash flows at a market rate. The
equity component is recognised initially for the amount of the difference between the proceeds from the issue of
the convertible bonds and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are
allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. The equity component of a hybrid financial instrument is not remeasured subsequent
to initial recognition.

Interest and any gains and losses related to the financial liability are recognised in profit or loss. Upon
conversion of the bonds, the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised.

F-48


-----

**_6.4.2.6 Derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps)_**

The Group has contracted interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risk exposure. They are not eligible for
hedge accounting under IAS 39 and consequently, any fair value adjustments are recognised in profit or loss.

**6.4.3 Goodwill and intangible assets**

**_6.4.3.1 Goodwill_**

For initial recognition of goodwill, see Note 6.4.1.1.

_Subsequent measurement_

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of
CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combination.

The CGUs or group of CGUs identified by the Group are as follows:

- Specialised clinical pathology CGU: this activity involves complex clinical testing and/or testing requiring
specific equipment that clients (hospitals, clinics, private or community laboratories) do not have.

- France private clinical laboratory testing CGU and Belux private clinical laboratory testing CGU.

- Clinical trials CGU: conducting clinical trials (logistics, analyses, results) for pharmaceutical companies
and biotechnology firms during the drug development phase.

Business goodwill acquired during the period is recognised as part of goodwill.

**_6.4.3.2 Research and development_**

Expenditure on research activities to gain new scientific and technical knowledge and understanding is
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Development expenditure is expensed if the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset as defined by IAS 38,
are not met.

Under IAS 38—Intangible Assets, development expenditure must be recognised as an intangible asset if the
entity is able to demonstrate:

- its intention and its financial and technical ability to complete the development project;

- that it is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the development expenditure will flow to
the entity; and

- that the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Gross capitalised development expenditure also includes borrowing costs.

**_6.4.3.3 Intangible assets_**

The intangible assets acquired by the Group that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

They include customer contractual relationships and order books acquired in business combinations.

F-49


-----

**_6.4.3.4 Subsequent expenditure_**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill
and brands, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

**_6.4.3.5 Amortisation_**

Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
from the date that they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

- Patents and trademarks 10 years

- Software 1 - 3 years

- Contractual customer relationships (specialised clinical pathology CGU) 19 years

- Order books (clinical trials CGU) 4 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted where
appropriate.

**6.4.4 Property, plant and equipment**

**_6.4.4.1 Recognition and measurement_**

In accordance with IAS 16, the gross carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment corresponds
to its acquisition or production cost and it is not revalued.

Capital expenditure grants are recognised as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the asset for which
they were granted.

Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When components of
property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major
components) of property, plant and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the difference between
the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.

Leases are dealt with in Note 6.4.5.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is dealt with in Note 6.4.4.3 below.

**_6.4.4.2 Subsequent costs_**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with
the expenditure will flow to the Group. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

**_6.4.4.3 Depreciation_**

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
each component. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it
is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.

F-50


-----

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and ready for use or,
in the case of self-constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

- Buildings 20 years

- Plant and equipment 5 - 10 years

- Fixtures and fittings 5 - 10 years

- Equipment and tooling 5 years

- Transport equipment 4 - 5 years

- Office and IT equipment 3 - 5 years

- Furniture 5 - 10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted where
appropriate.

**6.4.5 Leased assets**

Assets under finance leases or arrangements that are in substance finance leases as defined by IAS 17—Leases
and IFRIC 4, respectively, are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet.

Leases under whose substance or form the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership are classified as finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount
equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.

After the initial accounting, the asset is subsequently accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy
applicable to this type of asset.

Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the
reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period over the lease term so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Other leases are operating leases and are not recognised as non-current assets.

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of
the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, and as a
reduction in rental expense over the term of the lease.

**6.4.6 Inventories**

Finished goods inventories, mainly comprising reagents and consumables, are recognised at purchase cost, plus
any directly attributable costs. They are measured on a VAT-inclusive basis less the applicable pro rata
VAT amounts.

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the
first-in first-out method.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of
completion and selling expenses.

**6.4.7 Impairment**

**_6.4.7.1 Non-derivative financial assets_**

A financial asset not classified as at fair value is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is
objective evidence that it may be impairedas a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial
recognition of the asset giving rise to a loss event with an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset
that can be estimated reliably.

F-51


-----

_Financial assets measured at amortised cost_

The Group considers evidence of impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost (loans and
receivables) both individually and collectively.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit management
processes. Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the basis of historical data but provisions for
doubtful debts are booked on a case by case basis. In the specialised clinical pathology business, receivables
from direct patients which are more than 35 days overdue are handled by a debt collection company.

In assessing collective impairment of receivables, the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default,
payment patterns and the amount of losses incurred in the past, adjusted based on management’s assessment of
whether current economic and credit conditions are such that actual losses are likely to be greater or less than
those suggested by historical trends.

An impairment loss on a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Impairment losses are recognised in
profit or loss under “Net change in amortisation and impairment” with a matching entry in an allowance account
for loans and receivables. Any subsequent decrease in the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

**_6.4.7.2 Non-financial assets_**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and indefinite- lived intangible assets
are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or
cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset or CGU. Assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from
continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. For the purposes of
goodwill impairment testing, the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at
which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal
reporting purposes. CGUs are aggregated within operating segments. Goodwill acquired in a business
combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Goodwill impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs
are first allocated against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (or group of CGUs), and
then against the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed
only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

**6.4.8 Employee benefits**

In accordance with the laws and practices of the countries in which it operates, the Group grants its employees
post-employment benefits (pension plans) and other long-term benefits (long-service bonuses).

In addition to regulatory post-employment benefits in the countries in which the Group is present, Group
employees are also entitled to supplementary pension plans and lump sum retirement indemnities
(see Note 6.23).

These take the form of either defined contribution or defined benefit plans.indemnities (see Note 6.23).

Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make further
contributions and the corresponding expense is recognised in profit or loss for the period.

F-52


-----

**_6.4.8.1 Defined benefit plans_**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by
estimating the amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for services provided in the current and
prior periods, less any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of plan assets. The discount rate is the
yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds with similar maturities to the Group’s obligations
denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.

In accordance with Revised IAS 19—Employee Benefits, pensions and other post employment benefits are
measured by a qualified independent actuary using the projected unit credit method: each period of service gives
rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured separately to build up the final
obligation. The final obligation is then discounted to present value. These calculations require the use of:

- projected retirement dates;

- a discount rate;

- an inflation rate;

- assumptions regarding future salary increases and staff turnover.

Obligations are measured annually for the Group’s main plans and once every three years for other plans unless
changes in assumptions or significant changes in demographic data warrant more frequent measurement.

For each defined benefit plan, the Group recognises a provision equal to the benefit obligation, less the fair
value of plan assets, actuarial gains and losses and any unrecognised past service cost.

Actuarial gains and losses arise on change in assumptions or differences between forecast and actual data
concerning the benefit obligation or the performance of plan assets.

The Group recognises deferred cumulative actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits in equity and they
are presented in “Other comprehensive income”.

**_6.4.8.2 Other long-term employee benefits_**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than pension plans is equal to the
amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for services provided in the current and prior periods.
Other employee benefits mainly comprise seniority bonuses.

Actuarial gains/losses as well as the past services costs related to the long-term employee benefits other than
pensions are recognized immediately in the Profit and Loss.

**_6.4.8.3 Short-term employee benefits_**

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid in short-term cash bonuses or
incentive-based profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay the amount
as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**6.4.9 Provisions**

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation
that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle
the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The
unwinding of the discount is recognised under finance costs.

F-53


-----

**_6.4.9.1 Restructuring provisions_**

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring
plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not
provisioned.

**6.4.10 Net sales**

Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual volume discounts for
hospitals after the elimination of intra-group sales.

Specialised clinical pathology and private clinical testing operations are carried out in clinical laboratories.
Revenue related to analyses/tests carried out is recognised when the report is validated by the clinical
pathologist (on the date results are given to the client).

Clinical trials are governed by contractual agreements providing for specific invoicing arrangements at each
stage. Revenue is recognised using the percentage-of-completion method. Percentage of completion is measured
on the basis of work performed.

**6.4.11 Other income and expenses**

Other income and other expenses include both recurring and non-recurring income and expenses. Non-recurring
items comprise extraordinary income and expenses, which due to their nature, amount or frequency generally
correspond to major one-off or unusual events.

**6.4.12 Financial income and finance costs**

Net finance costs comprise:

- interest expense relating to financial debt;

- gains and losses on interest rate derivatives (rate swaps) used to hedge interest rate risk on the Group’s debt;

- income from cash and cash equivalents, which comprises interest paid on cash investments and cash
equivalents.

Other financial income and expense mainly comprise foreign exchange gains and losses and changes in the fair
value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

**6.4.13 Income tax**

Income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax recognised in accordance with IAS 12. Current tax and
deferred tax are recognised in profit and loss unless they relate to a business combination, or to items that are
recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable profit or tax loss for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and tax base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit;

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures insofar as it is probable that
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

F-54


-----

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the year- end and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability
is settled.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Company takes into account the impact of any
uncertain tax positions and any additional taxes and interest that may be due.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and
liabilities and they relate to taxes levied by the same authority, either on the same taxable entity or on different
tax entities that intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, and realise their tax assets and
settle their tax liabilities simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is only recognised for unused tax credits, tax losses and deductible temporary differences to
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it is no longer probable that taxable profit
will be available against which they can be used.

Net value at 1 January ............................................................................................................... 561,526
**Net value at 31 December........................................................................................................** **599,292**

The €37.8 million increase in the gross value of goodwill mainly relates to goodwill on acquisitions of securities
and companies (€32.1 million) and on purchased business goodwill (€5.7 million) during the period
(see Note 6.2).

Goodwill broken down by CGU is as follows:

**Carrying amount at** **Acquisitions** **Acquisitions** **Net book value at**
**(In millions of euro)** **31 December 2012** **or securities** **of businesses** **Impairment** **31 December 2013**

Specialised

Belux clinical

Clinical trial
CGU.................. 74.9 74.9
**Total.....................** **561.5** **32.1** **5.7** **—** **599.3**


In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill was tested for impairment at 31 December 2013 and no evidence of
impairment was identified for any of the CGUs. The impairment tests were based on the value in use of each
CGU calculated using the discounted cash flow method as described in Note 6.4.3.1 of the accounting policies
section.

The main assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of the CGUs as of 31 December 2013 were
the following:

**Cash flow** **Long-term**
**Cash generating units** **projection period** **Discount rate** **growth rate**

Specialised clinical pathology CGU................................... 6 years 8.20% 2.00%
France clinical laboratory testing CGU .............................. 6 years 8.20% 2.50%
Belux clinical laboratory testing CGU................................ 6 years 8.20% 2.50%
Clinical trial CGU............................................................... 6 years 8.90% 3.50%

Cash flows were discounted based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated on the basis of
the expected return and market risk for each CGU.

Impairment testing was carried out using the same procedures as in previous periods: key modelling
assumptions such as market multiples and the discount rate reflected stock market and macro-economic trends.

The resulting multiples are close to those of companies engaged in businesses that are similar to those of the
Cerba Group.

The terminal value is calculated by discounting cash flows to perpetuity, based on normalised cash flows and a
perpetuity growth rate, taking into account of market development potential and competitive position. The
discounted cash flows are compared to the sum of the goodwill and the operating assets allocated to the CGU

(intangible assets, items of property, plant and equipment and components of working capital, net of deferred
tax liabilities). The cash flows are taken from the six-year business plan validated by management based on
markets conditions at December 2013.

The growth rates used to estimate the cash flows of the CGUs or Groups of CGUs are considerably less than the
Group’s average historical growth rates.

At 30 June 2012, an impairment loss of €48.5 million was recognised on the specialised clinical pathology CGU
following impairment testing. Since then, no evidence of impairment has been identified.

The weighted average cost of capital and market multiples are adjusted based on business data and the
geographical location of the CGUs tested.

At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs or Groups of CGUs were
higher than their carrying amounts.

Sensitivity analyses have been performed on all of the CGUs and the results of testing the value in use (of the
groups of assets to which most goodwill is allocated) against changes in the various assumptions used at
31 December 2013 are shown in the following table:

**Discount rate for** **Growth rate to** **Combination of**

**(In millions of euro)** **Test margin** **cash flows 0.5%** **infinity −0.5%** **two factors**

Specialised clinical pathology CGU... 38.2 (18.3) (14.1) (30.2)
France clinical laboratory testing
CGU................................................ 64.5 (21.5) (16.9) (35.7)
Belux clinical laboratory testing
CGU................................................ 106.1 (24.8) (19.5) (41.0)
Clinical trial CGU............................... 12.8 (9.2) (7.4) (15.3)
**Total...................................................** **221.6** **(73.8)** **(57.9)** **(122.2)**


A decline in value in use following the application of the sensitivities indicated below either separately or based
on a combination of the two factors does not actually undermine the carrying amount of goodwill.

Only the clinical trials CGU would be exposed to a slight risk of impairment in the unlikely event of a
simultaneous change in the two factors indicated.

**6.21.1 Preference shares**

The Series A and B preference shares issued by Cerba European Lab (formerly Financière Gaillon 12) in July 2010 have
the following features:

- No voting rights (Art. 19.4 of the Articles of association).

- No rights to the Company’s profits (except for the preference dividend), assets, reserves, distributions or liquidation
surplus (Art. 22.1 of the Articles of association).

- Cumulative annual preference dividend equal to 10% of the subscription value of each Series A and B share
calculated as of 21 July 2010 and capitalised annually (Art. 22.1 of the Articles of association).

- The Series A and B preference dividends may be adjusted in the event of a market floatation or a loss of controlling
interest (Art. 22.2 of the Articles of association).

- No maturity date.

**6.21.2 Ordinary shares**

Each ordinary share carries one voting right at the general meetings of shareholders. Each share entitles its owner to
receive a share in the Company’s profits, assets, reserves, distributions or liquidation surplus.

**6.21.3 Warrants**

On 21 July 2010, Cerba European Lab (formerly Financière Gaillon 12) issued 16 million shares with warrants for an
aggregate nominal value of €160,000. The share premium amounted to €15.84 million and the warrants to €0.79 million.

Each share has two warrants attached: warrant 1 valued at €0.015625 and warrant 2 at €0.03375.

Shares with warrants are reserved for senior executives and some Group company managers, designated by the
Commitments Board. The shares with warrants were issued at fair value as determined by an expert.

They were measured at the grant-date fair value, which corresponds to their issue price. Consequently, no expense was
recognised under IFRS 2.

Financing arrangements set up when the Group was created were as follows:

F-71


-----

- Convertible and non-convertible bonds, most of which bear interest at 10%, maturing on 21 July 2025. The Interests
are capitalised annually. The majority of convertible bonds were converted into shares following the decision of the
General Shareholders’ Meeting of 11 December 2012 to increase the share capital of the holding company.

- Existing loans at 31 January 2012 were refinanced by the high- yield bonds issued on 31 January 2013
(see Note 2.1).

- The Group has also received financing from its shareholders in the form of non-convertible bonds.

The Group’s subsidiaries have local medium-term credit facilities.

Loans and borrowings can be analysed by type of rate (fixed or floating interest rates) as follows:

**Fixed** **Floating** **Fixed** **Floating**

This analysis does not take account of interest rate hedging instruments.

**6.22.2 Debts covenants**

The main financial liabilities are subject to certain conditions applied to the consolidated financial statements and notably
the ratio of net debt to gross operating profit (or EBITDA).

Following the refinancing operation of January 2013, new debt covenants were negotiated with the Group’s banks,
replacing the pre-existing covenants (see Notes 6.2, 6.22.1 and 6.32).

As part of its Revolving Credit Facility, the Group is bound by two new covenants calculated based on the consolidated
accounts: Leverage ratio (Consolidated Total Net Debt/Consolidated proforma EBITDA) and Percentage Test
(contribution of the loan guarantors to consolidated EBITDA and consolidated assets).

_Of which:_
_Employee benefit obligations........................................................................._ _5,618_ 4,932
_Plan assets ....................................................................................................._ _(478)_ (552)

In certain countries, Group employees are entitled to supplementary pension plans into which the Group pays annual
contributions, and lump sum retirement indemnities paid out once the employees retire. These take the form of either
defined contribution or defined benefit plans.

Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make further contributions and the
corresponding expense is recognised in profit or loss for the period. All defined benefit plans concern France.

**6.23.1 Change in the present value of the net defined benefit obligation**

Changes in the Group’s net defined benefit obligation break down as follows, taking into account the related plan assets
totalling €478 thousand as of December 2013.

Financial income from plan assets................................................................. 21 12
Curtailments and settlements system............................................................. 221 77
**Income (Expense) recognised in profit or loss...........................................** **(163)** **(275)**

This impact is recognised in full in profit or loss from recurring operations under “Personnel expenses”.

Revised IAS 19 has had a minimal impact on the measurement of the Group’s employee benefit obligations for 2013.

The only impact relates to financial income generated on plan assets (these assets concern approximately 10% of the
lump sum retirement indemnity benefit obligation) which is identical to the rate used to discount liabilities, i.e., yield
equivalent to the discount rate.

**6.23.3 Actuarial assumptions**

All of the Group’s various employee benefit obligations are regularly reviewed by actuaries in accordance with IFRS
standards using the projected unit credit method based on salaries at retirement.

All actuarial gains and losses and adjustments relating to the limitation are recognised in the reporting period in which
they occur in accordance with Revised IAS 19.

Actuarial assumptions (i.e., the probability that active employees will continue to work in the Group, mortality rates,
retirement age, assumptions regarding future salary increases, etc.) depend on the demographic and economic conditions
in the countries in which the different plans have been set up.

Discount rates used to determine the present value of benefit obligations are based either on the government bond rate or
on the yield on investment grade corporate bonds that are traded in an active market with maturities that match the
duration of the benefit obligation. In the eurozone, discount rates have been calculated on software developed by
independent actuaries.

**_6.28.1.1 Introduction_**

The Group has exposure to the following risks arising on its financial instruments:

- Credit risk

F-75


-----

- Liquidity risk

- Market risk

This note presents information on the Group’s exposure to each of the above-mentioned risks, and its objectives, policies
and procedures for measuring and managing risk, and capital management.

**_6.28.1.2 Risk management framework_**

The Supervisory Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management
framework.

The Group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set
appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to predetermined limits. Risk management
policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The
Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a rigorous and effective control
environment in which all employees understand their roles and responsibilities.

The Audit Committee oversees implementation of Group risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.

**6.28.2 Credit risk**

Credit risk is managed at Group level. It is the risk of financial loss for the Group if a client or counterparty should fail to
meet its contractual payment obligations.

Credit risk concerns cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial
institutions, as well as exposure to customer credit risk on outstanding receivables.

In the specialised clinical pathology business, the collection of receivables from direct patients, which are more than
35 days overdue, is handled by a debt collection company acting solely as a collection agent on behalf of Cerba.
Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the basis of historical data.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit management processes.

The Group entered into a factoring arrangement in February 2012 but this contract had not been fully used at year-end.
Its contractual conditions do not make it possible to conclude that the main risks and rewards related to the assigned
receivables have actually been transferred to the factor as the related credit risk is not transferred. The trade receivables
are therefore retained in the financial statements and stand at €54 million at 31 December 2013.

The carrying amount of loans and receivables represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.

**_6.28.2.1 Trade and other receivables_**

The Group believes that it is neither exposed to material credit risk nor to over dependence on a specific customer due to
its broad customer base, with customers located mainly in Europe.

**_6.28.2.2 Impairment losses_**

Cumulative impairment of trade and other receivables dropped 13% year on year to €3,257 million (2012:
€3,742 million). Provisions for impairment are mainly related to Cerba’s operations.

**6.28.3 Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk of the Group encountering difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled in cash or other financial assets. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure,
as far as possible, that it always has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and
“challenging” conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or damaging the Group’s reputation.

The following are the undiscounted contractual cash flows required to settle financial liabilities, including estimated
interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements:

**6.28.4 Market risk**

Market risk includes the risk of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity
instrument prices affecting the Group’s profit or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk
management is to contain market risk exposures within acceptable thresholds, while optimising returns.

**_6.28.4.1 Currency risk_**

The Group’s financial performance is not materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations since a significant portion of
operations takes place within the eurozone and income and expenses are generally denominated in the same currency.

The following exchange rates were used during the period for the main currencies:

**Exchange rate** **Average rate** **Exchange rate** **Average rate**
**at 31 December** **at 31 December** **at 31 December** **at 31 December**

**2013** **2012**
AUD Australian Dollar.......................... 1,5423 1,3770 1,2712 1,2413
USD US Dollar...................................... 1,3791 1,3282 1,3194 1,2856
ZAR Rand.............................................. 14,5660 12,8308 11,1727 10,55455


**_6.28.4.2 Interest rate risk_**

Most of the Group’s financing has been contracted at fixed rates and notably the high-yield bond issue of
31 January 2013.

Therefore, the Group is less exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its floating interest rate bank loans than in
previous years.

The Group contracts interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate risk. Only Laboratoire Cerba is still concerned as
Cerba European Lab unwound its positions following refinancing of the Group’s debt in early 2013.

At 31 December 2013, the Group had hedged a €13 million property lease with pay-fixed interest rate swaps.

The carrying amount of the derivative financial instruments used to hedge interest rate risk is presented below:

**Notional**

**(In thousands of euro)** **Termination date** **principal** **Fair value** **Fair value**

**31 December 2013** **31 December 2012**
**Pay fixed-rate swap**
3-month Euribor—1.9790% ............... 30/09/2013 50,000 (913)
3-month Euribor—1.60% ................... 30/09/2013 190,000 (2,047)
3-month Euribor—1.25% ................... 30/09/2013 40,000 (325)
3-month Euribor—4.16% ................... 11/01/2019 10,886 (821) (1,143)
3-month Euribor—2.195% ................. 27/07/2023 2,076 (77) (135)
**Total pay fixed-rate swap.................** **292,962** **(898)** **(4,563)**
**A-month Euribor pay**
**Swap + Margin for 3-month**
**Euribor**
1-month Euribor + 0.36% against
E3M ................................................ 30/09/2014 100,000 (1,028)
1-month Euribor + 1.2850% against
E3M ................................................ 30/09/2014 100,000 (892)
**Total pay floating-rate swap** ............ **200,000** **(1,920)**
**Total derivative instruments............** **(898)** **(6,483)**

These interest rate swaps are economic hedges of interest rate risk on loans and borrowings; they have not been
designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

Following the refinancing operation on 31 January 2013, most of the hedging contracts (for a nominal amount of
€480 million) were terminated. The cash outflow linked to this operation amounted to €4.4 million, generating a profit of
€0.8 million due to changes in the fair value of these swaps in January 2013.

**6.28.5 Capital management**

The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base to ensure the Group’s independence and support future
development of the business. Capital consists of ordinary shares, non-redeemable preference shares and retained
earnings. The Supervisory Board monitors the return on equity.

**6.28.6 Carrying amounts and fair values**

**_6.28.6.1 Fair values compared with carrying amounts_**

The table below shows the fair values of financial assets and liabilities and the carrying amounts reported in the statement
of financial position:

**Financial liabilities...........** **898** **525,700** **526,598** **6,483** **461,810** **468,293**

The fair value of trade receivables and trade payables is the amount reported in the statement of financial position, given
the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The same applies to other receivables and payables.

The fair value of swaps corresponds to their valuation by their issuing bank. Financial liabilities are recognised at
amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s bank loans are contracted at variable rates based on
Euribor and their fair value is deemed to correspond to their value at the closing date.

**_6.28.6.2 Fair value hierarchy_**

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been
defined as follows:

- Level 1: fair value is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

- Level 2: fair value is measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e. inferred from observable prices).

F-79

- Level 3: fair value is measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).

**6.28.7 Operating Leases**

Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases at 31 December 2013 are shown in the following
table:

**More than**

**(In thousands of euro)** **31 December 2013** **< 1 year** **1 to 5 years** **5 years**

**Total** ............................................................................ **16,893** **3,425** **11,848** **1,620**

Operating leases are entered into at market rates and accounted for as operating leases (see Note 6.4.5).

The Group uses operating leases for industrial equipment (mainly vehicles and transport equipment) when there is no
economic justification for acquiring the assets in question.

The Group has no contingent lease commitments or sub-letting agreements.

Given the Group’s structure, key management compensation has not been disclosed as it would mean revealing
individual salaries.

**6.32** **Subsequent events**

On 13 January 2014, Mr. Jean-Luc Dourson and Biopart (a company wholly-owned by Mr. Dourson) initiated
extra-judicial proceedings against CEL before the Paris Commercial Court (tribunal de commerce de Paris). They are
mainly seeking rescission of the Sale Agreement of 6 June 2011, under the terms of which LLAM SA (owner of
Luxembourg-based Ketterthill laboratory) was acquired; and the contracts entered into in execution of said Agreement.

They claim that CEL did not fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and that consequently, rescission may be granted
solely due to the fault of CEL, pursuant to Article 1184 of the French Civil Code.

Both the Group and its legal counsel consider these demands to be unfounded and have that there are excellent arguments
that can be used to convince the Court to throw out all of the aforementioned requests.

Consequently, no provision has been set aside in the accounts for 2013.

**Cerba European Lab**

**Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated**
**financial statements**
For the year ended December 31, 2012

To the Shareholders,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your article of association and your annual general meeting, we
hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2012, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of CERBA EUROPEAN LAB

- the justification of our assessments,

- the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. Our role is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

**1 Opinion on the consolidated financial statements**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of
selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the
financial position of the group at December 31, 2012 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**2 Justification of our assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) relating to
the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matter:

**_Accounting estimate_**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, your company is required to make a number of estimates and
assumptions that affect the value of certain assets and liabilities, expense and revenue items. The accounting estimates
used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2012 are described in the note 6.3.5
“Use of estimates and judgments” to the consolidated financial statements.

In particular your company performed impairment tests on goodwill as of December 31, 2012 based on the methods
described in the note 6.6 “Goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed the methods used to
carry out these impairment tests as well as the corresponding assumptions applied by your company in order to determine
the values in use and we have verified that the note to the consolidated financial statements provides appropriate
disclosure.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore
contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

**3 Specific verification**

As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified the
information presented in the group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

**6 Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**6.1** **Reporting entity**

Financière Gaillon 12 SAS merged with Cerba European Lab on 27 June 2012. The merger was backdated to
1 January 2012 and the new entity was renamed Cerba European Lab on 2 July 2012.

Cerba European Lab (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) is a French simplified joint-stock company (société par
_actions simplifiée) with a Management Board and Supervisory Board, headquartered in France at 7/11 Rue de l’Equerre,_
95310 Saint- Ouen-l’Aumône.

The Company was created on 8 June 2010 following the acquisition of the Cerba European Lab Group.

The Company’s first financial reporting period began on 8 June 2010 and ended on 14 July 2010. Its second reporting
period was an extraordinary seventeen-and-a-half-month period, from 15 July 2010 to 31 December 2011.

The Group is a leading European player in medical biology with strong positions in first intention healing and highly
specialised tests including central laboratory facilities for clinical trials.

Cerberus Nightingale 2 SA holds a 76.66% stake in the Company.

**6.2** **Significant events**

The Group continued its policy of external growth. It acquired the following interests during the year (see Note 6.6):

- Laboratoire LABM de Larrard (85.37%) on 1 April 2012; further to the acquisition date, the Group raised its interest
in LABM de Larrard to 90.1%;

- Laboratoire GD BIO (100%) on 30 June 2012;

- Laboratoire Petite Ile (100%) on 1 January 2012;

- Laboratoire MedicAnalyses (100%) on 1 July 2012;

- Laboratoire Notre-Dame (51%) on 18 October 2012;

- Laboratoire L Loriot (100%) on 10 December 2012;

- Laboratoire Plaine des Cafres (70%) on 10 December 2012.

The Group also acquired various business premises, the largest of which for €3.1 million based in Dénain, France.

The Group was also reorganised during the year.

The following were transferred onto the books of other entities:

- Biolec and Labo des Fêtes into Centre Biologique du Chemin Vert (CBCV);

- Medicanalyses into Laboratoire de Larrard;

- Alphabio into Biopyrénées;

- Eurolab and Vignoli into Biotop;

- Douaisis and Biometropole into Biolille;

- Financière Bruno Flechet into Cerba;

- Laboratoire du Centre into Bioreunion;

- Labo Technical Equipment into Llam.

F-96


-----

- Laboratoire LABM de Larrard was merged into Bioadour under the simplified merger procedure (fusion simplifiée).

The Group obtained a new €70 million credit facility for its external growth operations. No amounts had been drawn
down under this facility during the year, and the entire amount remains available as of 31 December 2012.

Through Cerba European Lab (formerly Financière Gaillon 12), the Group received an initial advance from Cerberus
Nightingale 2 in the amount of €10 million on 6 January 2012, a second advance of €3 million on 21 September 2012 and
a third advance of €2 million on 23 December 2012. A total of €8.1 million of this advance was converted into equity on
11 December 2012.

This remaining advance of €6.9 million is repayable in March 2013. If the advances are not fully repaid at the planned
date, the terms and conditions applicable will be identical to those applied to the €12 million convertible bonds issued on
21 July 2010 and which mature on 21 July 2025.

On 11 December 2012, the Group undertook a €158.1 million capital increase through the conversion into equity of the
bulk of the convertible bonds. The outstanding convertible bonds amount to €9.7 million, breaking down as €4.3 million
in equity and €5.4 million in debt.

Laboratoire Cerba set up a factoring contract without credit insurance for its trade receivables with effect from
24 February 2012 (see section 6.4.2.1).

On 31 January 2013, the Group completed a successful issue of €365 million worth of high-yield bonds (see Note 6.31,
Subsequent events) which it used to refinance debt issued in July 2010 (senior bank loan and mezzanine debt) and
unwind the swap. In accordance with IAS 39, the costs relating to the July 2010 debt issuance are amortised over the
term of the loan using the effective interest method.

As of 31 December 2012, the Group considered that the refinancing transaction described above was probable.
Accordingly, the new maturity date of the bonds, used for the purposes of calculating the effective interest rate, was set at
31 January 2013. This new assumption led the Group to recognise an additional pre-tax charge of €11.6 million in 2012
(€10.4 million after tax), corresponding to the unamortised portion of the initial issuance costs. These costs had no impact
on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

**6.3** **Basis of preparation**

**6.3.1 Statement of compliance**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 have been prepared in accordance
with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the IASB, as approved by the European Union at
31 December 2012. A detailed presentation of these standards is available on the European Commission’s website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm.

**_Revised standards, amendments and interpretations applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after_**
**_1 January 2012_**

The new accounting standards and interpretations listed below, applied by the Group for the first time in the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

- Amendments to IFRS 7—Financial Instruments: Disclosures—Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,
concerning disclosures in connection with the transfer of assets, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or
after 1 July 2011. These amendments did not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements at 31 December 2012.

**_New standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB but not yet applicable or not early-adopted by_**
**_the Group:_**

**_•_** Amendments to IAS 12—Income Taxes—Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets, applicable for accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012.

- Amendments to IAS 1—Presentation of Financial Statements—Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive
Income (OCI).

- Amendments to IAS 19—Employee Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans.

F-97


-----

- IFRS 9—Financial Instruments—Phase I: Classification and Measurement.

- IFRS 10—Consolidated Financial Statements.

- IFRS 11—Joint Arrangements.

- IFRS 12—Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.

- IFRS 13—Fair Value Measurement.

- Revised IAS 27—Separate Financial Statements.

- IAS 28—Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.

- The IFRS annual improvements 2009-2011 cycle.

- Amendments to transition guidance for IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12.

The Group is currently analysing the impact on its consolidated financial statements of the standards published by the
IASB at 31 December 2012 but not yet adopted by the EU, however it does not expect the impact to be material.

**6.3.2 Comparability of financial statements**

The accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2012 are identical to those
used for the consolidated statements at 31 December 2011 with the following exception: since 1 January 2012, the
French tax on value added (contribution sur la valeur ajoutée—CVAE) has been recognised as income tax expense in
application of IAS 12 (see 6.4.14). This tax was previously recorded as an operating expense.

Certain changes have also been made to the manner in which financial instruments are presented and the Group has
restated prior periods for comparability in accordance with IAS 8—Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors (see Note 6.29).

**6.3.3 Basis of measurement**

The annual consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost principle, except for derivative
instruments, which are measured at fair value.

**6.3.4 Functional and presentation currency**

The annual consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, the Company’s functional currency,
and rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise specified.

**6.3.5 Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.

They are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The impacts of changes to estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimates are revised and for all future periods affected.

Estimates and assumptions mainly concern:

- the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill (the related assumptions are presented in notes 6.4.3.1
and 6.6);

- obligations under defined benefit plans (assumptions presented in Note 6.17);

- the measurement of deferred tax assets (see Note 6.10).

-----

**6.4** **Significant accounting policies**

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial
statements and by all Group entities.

**6.4.1 Basis of consolidation**

The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements include those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries for
the period ended 31 December 2012. All of the subsidiaries close their accounts on 31 December, except for LBS
(31 October) and CRI (30 November).

**_6.4.1.1 Business combinations_**

Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which
control was transferred to the Group.

The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

- the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus

- the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus

- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree; less

- the net recognised amount (generally the fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Contingent consideration is recognised in equity if the contingent payment is settled by delivery of a fixed number of the
acquirer’s equity instruments; in all other cases, it is recognised in liabilities related to business combinations. Contingent
consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. If the
contingent consideration was originally recognised as a liability, any subsequent adjustments are recognised in profit or
loss unless such adjustments are made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are related to facts and circumstances
existing at the acquisition date. Purchased goodwill is accounted for as a business combination.

**_6.4.1.2 Acquisitions of non-controlling interests_**

Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners.
Therefore, no goodwill is recognised. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not
involve the loss of control are determined based on the proportionate interest in the net assets of the subsidiary.

**_6.4.1.3 Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

French legislation requires laboratories to be incorporated as private practice companies (Société d’Exercice Libéral—
_SEL) and the clinical pathologists operating the private practice companies to hold at least 50% of the voting rights at_
shareholders’ annual general meetings. In strict compliance with these regulations, the Group has created a capital
structure to meet these obligations and hold the majority of the related financial interests (see Note 6.5). Moreover,
specific clauses, especially concerning the governance structure, are included in the articles of association and
shareholders agreements.

Although the Group does not hold the majority of voting rights in the private practice companies, the above-mentioned
mechanisms allow it to obtain the majority of the economic benefits derived from the activities of these companies and
also to demonstrate the existence of de facto control in full compliance with French legislation, therefore enabling the
French entities to be fully consolidated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

F-99


-----

**_6.4.1.4 Loss of control_**

Upon loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and
the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any profit or loss arising on the loss of control is recognised in
profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in its former subsidiary, said interest is measured at fair value at the date
that control is relinquished. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an available-for-sale
financial asset, depending on the level of influence retained.

**_6.4.1.5 Transactions eliminated in consolidation_**

Intra-group balances and transactions and any income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated
in the consolidated financial statements.

**_6.4.1.6 Foreign currency transactions_**

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies of the respective Group
entities at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at
the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the closing exchange rate.

Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in profit or loss.

**_6.4.1.7 Foreign operations_**

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations—including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions—
whose functional currency is not the euro, are translated into euros at the closing exchange rate, and their statements of
comprehensive income are translated into euros using average exchange rates for the period.

The foreign currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognised in “Other
comprehensive income”. They are carried in the foreign currency translation reserve in consolidated equity until the
related investments are sold or wound up.

**6.4.2 Financial instruments**

**_6.4.2.1 Non-derivative financial assets_**

The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date they originated. All other financial assets are recognised
initially on the transaction date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by
the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and
only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Factoring contract_

Receivables assigned to third parties under factoring agreements are derecognised when substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership are transferred to these third parties and, more particularly, when the factoring company bears the
risks of non-recoverability and late payment.

_Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently remeasured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.

F-100


-----

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three months or less from the
acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their value, and which are used by the Group in the
management of its short-term commitments.

**_6.4.2.2 Non-derivative financial liabilities_**

The Group initially recognises debt securities and subordinated liabilities on the date they originated. All other financial
liabilities (including liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the transaction
date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations have been discharged, cancelled or expired.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities as other financial liabilities. Such financial liabilities are
recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently remeasured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other payables.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as
a component of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

**_6.4.2.3 Share capital_**

_Ordinary shares_

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of
any tax effect.

_Preference shares_

Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable, or redeemable at the Company’s discretion only,
and the distribution of any dividends is also discretionary. Dividends thereon are deducted directly from equity once they
have been approved by the Company’s shareholders at their general meeting.

All of the preference shares issued by the Group meet the definition of equity instruments.

_Share-based payment_

On 21 July 2010, the Company issued shares with warrants to senior executives and some Group employees.

The issue was recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as a share-based payment and the warrants were measured at fair
value on the grant date.

The fair value of stock options is based on (i) the exercise price and the expected life of the option; (ii) the price of the
underlying stock at the grant date; (iii) the expected volatility in the share price; (iv) forecast dividends; and (v) the
risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.

This method results in a fair value of warrants that is equal to their issue price. The shares with warrants have therefore
been classified as equity at their issue cost. Since the issue price is equal to the grant-date fair value, the corresponding
expense in the income statement is nil.

**_6.4.2.4 Derivative financial instruments_**

Hybrid financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible bonds denominated in euros that can be converted
into a fixed number of shares.

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that
does not have a conversion option, by discounting the contractual cash flows at a market rate. The equity component is
recognised initially for the amount of the difference between the proceeds from the issue of the convertible bonds and the

F-101


-----

fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity
components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

The liability component of a hybrid financial instrument is subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. The equity component of a hybrid financial instrument is not remeasured subsequent to initial
recognition.

Interest and any gains and losses related to the financial liability are recognised in profit or loss. Upon conversion of the
bonds, the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised.

**_6.4.2.5 Derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps)_**

The Group has contracted interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risk exposure. They are not eligible for hedge
accounting under IAS 39 and consequently, any fair value adjustments are recognised in profit or loss.

**6.4.3 Goodwill and intangible assets**

**_6.4.3.1 Goodwill_**

For initial recognition of goodwill, see Note 6.4.1.1.

F-102


-----

_Subsequent measurement_

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash- generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs
that are expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combination.

The CGUs or group of CGUs identified by the Group are as follows:

- Specialised clinical pathology CGU: this activity involves complex clinical testing and/or testing requiring specific
equipment that clients (hospitals, clinics, private or community laboratories) do not have.

- France private clinical laboratory testing CGU and Belux private clinical laboratory testing CGU.

- Clinical trial CGU: conducting clinical trials (logistics, analyses, results) for pharmaceutical companies and
biotechnology firms during the drug development phase.

Business goodwill acquired during the period is recognised as part of goodwill.

**_6.4.3.2 Research and development_**

Expenditure on research activities to gain new scientific and technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in
profit or loss as incurred.

Development expenditure is expensed if the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset as defined by IAS 38, are
not met.

**_6.4.3.3 Other intangible assets_**

The intangible assets acquired by the Group that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

They include customer contractual relationships and order books acquired in business combinations.

**_6.4.3.4 Subsequent expenditure_**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset
to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

**_6.4.3.5 Amortisation_**

Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from the date
that they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

- Patents and trademarks 10 years

- Software 1 - 3 years

- Contractual customer relationships (specialised clinical pathology CGU) 19 years

- Order books (clinical trials CGU) 4 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted where
appropriate.

**6.4.4 Property, plant and equipment**

**_6.4.4.1 Recognition and measurement_**

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses.

F-103


-----

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When components of property, plant
and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant
and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the difference between the net
proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.

**_6.4.4.2 Subsequent costs_**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the
expenditure will flow to the Group. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

**_6.4.4.3 Depreciation_**

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
component. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably
certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and ready for use or, in the
case of self-constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

- Buildings 20 years

- Plant and equipment 5 - 10 years

- Fixtures and fittings 5 - 10 years

- Equipment and tooling 5 years

- Transport equipment 4 - 5 years

- Office and IT equipment 3 - 5 years

- Furniture 5 - 10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted where
appropriate.

**6.4.5 Leased assets**

Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments.

The asset is subsequently accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to this type of asset.

Other leases are operating leases and are not recognised as such in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, and as a reduction in rental
expense over the term of the lease.

Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of
the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period over the lease term so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

**6.4.6 Inventories**

Finished goods inventories, mainly comprising reagents and consumables, are recognised at purchase cost, plus any
directly attributable costs. They are measured on a VAT-inclusive basis less the applicable pro rata VAT amounts.

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in
first-out method.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of
completion and selling expenses.

F-104


-----

**6.4.7 Impairment**

**_6.4.7.1 Non-derivative financial assets_**

A financial asset not classified as at fair value is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective
evidence that it may be impaired as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset
giving rise to a loss event with an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset that can be estimated reliably.

_Financial assets measured at amortised cost_

The Group considers evidence of impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost (loans and receivables) both
individually and collectively.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit management processes.
Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the basis of historical data but provisions for doubtful debts are
booked on a case by case basis. In the specialised clinical pathology business, receivables from direct patients which are
more than 35 days overdue are handled by a debt collection company.

In assessing collective impairment of receivables, the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, payment
patterns and the amount of losses incurred in the past, adjusted based on management’s assessment of whether current
economic and credit conditions are such that actual losses are likely to be greater or less than those suggested by
historical trends.

An impairment loss on a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying
amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss under
“Net change in amortisation and impairment” with a matching entry in an allowance account for loans and receivables.
Any subsequent decrease in the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

**_6.4.7.2 Non-financial assets_**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at
each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s
recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and indefinite- lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An
impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable
amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Assets are
grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the CGUs to
which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the
lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. CGUs are aggregated within operating
segments. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination.

Goodwill impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are first
allocated against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (or group of CGUs), and then against the
carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

**6.4.8 Employee benefits**

In accordance with the laws and practices of the countries in which it operates, the Group grants its employees
post-employment benefits (pension plans) and other long-term benefits (long-service bonuses).

F-105


-----

**_6.4.8.1 Defined benefit plans_**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the
amount of future benefits vested by employees in return for services provided in the current and prior periods, less any
unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of plan assets. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA
credit-rated bonds with similar maturities to the Group’s obligations denominated in the currency in which the benefits
are expected to be paid.

Calculations are performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The Group recognises
all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in “Other comprehensive income”.

**_6.4.8.2 Other long-term employee benefits_**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than pension plans is equal to the amount of
future benefits vested by employees in return for services provided in the current and prior periods. Other employee
benefits mainly comprise seniority bonuses.

Actuarial gains/losses as well as the past services costs related to the long-term employee benefits other than pensions are
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**_6.4.8.3 Short-term employee benefits_**

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid in short-term cash bonuses or incentive- based
profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay the amount as a result of past
service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**6.4.9 Provisions**

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can
be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised
under finance costs.

**_6.4.9.1 Restructuring provisions_**

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has (i) approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and
(ii) the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provisioned.

**6.4.10 Net sales**

Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual volume discounts for hospitals.

Specialised clinical pathology and private clinical testing operations are carried out in clinical laboratories. Revenue
related to analyses/tests carried out is recognised when the report is validated by the clinical pathologist (on the date
results are given to the client).

Clinical trials are governed by contractual agreements providing for specific invoicing arrangements at each stage.
Revenue is recognised using the percentage-of-completion method. Percentage of completion is measured on the basis of
work performed.

**6.4.11 Government grants**

The French government subsidises screening for Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). It has contributed €8 per test
for tests performed since 1 January 2011.

This subsidy is recognised as other income once the Group is eligible to receive it (when the tests have been performed).

F-106


-----

**6.4.12 Other income and expenses**

Other income and other expenses include both recurring and non-recurring income and expenses. Non-recurring items
comprise non-recurring income and expenses, which due to their nature, amount or frequency generally correspond to
major one-off or unusual events.

**6.4.13 Financial income and expense**

Net finance costs comprise:

- interest expense relating to financial debt;

- gains and losses on interest rate derivatives (rate swaps) used to hedge interest rate risk on the Group’s debt;

- income from cash and cash equivalents, which comprises interest paid on cash investments and cash equivalents.

Other financial income and expense mainly comprise foreign exchange gains and losses and changes in the fair value of
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

**6.4.14 Income tax**

Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss unless they
relate to a business combination, or to items that are recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is (i) the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable profit or tax loss for the period, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and (ii) any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and
tax base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit;

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures insofar as it is probable that they will
not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the year-end and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Company takes into account the impact of any uncertain tax
positions and any additional taxes and interest that may be due.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities
and they relate to taxes levied by the same authority, either on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities that
intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, and realise their tax assets and settle their tax liabilities
simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is only recognised for unused tax credits, tax losses and deductible temporary differences to the
extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets
are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it is no longer probable that taxable profit will be available against
which they can be used.

The French Finance Act of 2010 eliminated business tax (taxe professionnelle) as of 2010 and replaced it with two new
taxes: the property business tax (cotisation des entreprises—CFE) and the French tax on value added (CVAE). In
accordance with the CNC opinion dated 14 January 2010, the Group has concluded that French tax on value added falls
within the scope of IAS 12 and is therefore recognised as income tax. A deferred tax liability related to the CVAE has
been recognised.

The €25.3 million increase in the gross value of goodwill includes goodwill on new acquisitions (€22 million) and
business goodwill relating to the acquisition of Dénain by Biolille for €3.1 million.

F-110


-----

In accordance with IAS 8, the carrying amount at 31 December 2011 was adjusted in an amount of €10.7 million in order
to reflect:

- the recognition of a CVAE deferred tax liability for €1.2 million (see Note 6.10); and

- the reclassification of existing business goodwill for €9.5 million, which was previously included in “other
intangible assets” (see Note 6.7).

Goodwill broken down by CGU is as follows:

**Carrying amount at** **Change** **Carrying amount at**
**(In millions of euros)** **31 December 2011** **in scope** **Other** **Impairment** **31 December 2012**

Specialised clinical pathology
CGU......................................... 172.3 (48.5) 123.8
France clinical laboratory testing
CGU......................................... 138.1 25.3 3.3 166.6
Belux clinical laboratory testing
CGU......................................... 193.8 2.4 196.2
Clinical trial CGU........................ 74.9 74.9
**Total** ............................................ **579.1** **25.3** **5.6** **(48.5)** **561.5**


In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill was tested for impairment at 30 June 2012 and at 31 December 2012, further to an
indication of impairment having been identified for one CGU. The impairment tests were based on the value in use of
each CGU calculated using the discounted cash flow method.

The main assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of the CGUs as of 31 December 2012 were
the following:

**Cash flow** **Long-term**
**Cash generating units** **projection period** **Discount rate** **growth rate**

Specialised clinical pathology CGU ........................................ 6 years 8.00% 2.00%
France clinical laboratory testing CGU ................................... 6 years 8.00% 2.50%
Belux clinical laboratory testing CGU..................................... 6 years 8.00% 2.50%
Clinical trial CGU.................................................................... 6 years 10.00% 3.50%

Cash flows were discounted based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated on the basis of the
expected return and market risk for each CGU.

The terminal value is calculated by discounting cash flows to perpetuity, based on normalised cash flows and a perpetuity
growth rate, taking into account of market development potential and competitive position. The discounted cash flows
are compared to the sum of the goodwill and the operating assets allocated to the CGU (intangible assets, items of
property, plant and equipment and components of working capital, net of deferred tax liabilities). The cash flows are
taken from the six-year business plan validated by management based on markets conditions in December 2012.

At 30 June 2012, an impairment loss of €48.5 million was recognised on the specialised clinical pathology CGU
following impairment testing. Since then, no evidence of impairment has been identified.

F-111


-----

A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the clinical trials CGU—the CGU most exposed to a risk of impairment—
and the terminal value is equal to the sum of goodwill values discounted using a rate of 10.75%, or a long-term growth
rate of 2.48%.

**6.7** **Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets include customer contractual relationships and order books identified when the Group was
acquired by Cerba European Lab (formerly Financière Gaillon 12).

calculated as of 21 July 2010 and capitalised annually (Art. 22.1 of the Articles of association).

F-116


-----

 - The Series A and B preference dividends may be adjusted in the event of a market floatation or a loss of controlling
interest (Art. 22.2 of the Articles of association).

 - No maturity date.

**6.15.2 Ordinary shares**

Each ordinary share carries one voting right at the general meetings of shareholders. Each share entitles its owner to

**6.15.3 Shares with warrants**

On 21 July 2010, Cerba European Lab (formerly Financière Gaillon 12) issued 16 million shares with warrants for an
aggregate nominal value of €160,000. The share premium amounted to €15.84 million and the warrants to €0.79 million.

Each share has two warrants attached: warrant 1 valued at €0.015625 and warrant 2 at €0.03375.

Shares with warrants are reserved for senior executives and some Group company managers, designated by the
Commitments Board. The shares with warrants were issued at fair value as determined by an expert.

They were measured at the grant-date fair value, which corresponds to their issue price. Consequently, no expense was
recognised under IFRS 2.

In accordance with IAS 8, financial liabilities were restated at 31 December 2011 in order to take into account the
non-material adjustments on the application of the effective interest rate to the various bank borrowing facilities (impact
of €0.8 million).

The factoring debt comprises the liability flow with Factor Natixis under the factoring agreement dated 24 February 2012
(see notes 6.4.2.1 and 6.27.2).

Financing arrangements set up when the Group was created were as follows:

- Convertible and non-convertible bonds, most of which bear interest at 10%, maturing on 21 July 2025. Interest is
capitalised annually. The majority of convertible bonds were converted into shares following the decision of the
General Shareholders’ Meeting of 11 December 2012 to increase the share capital of the holding company.

- A bond with warrants (mezzanine) expiring on 31 July 2018. This bond has a fixed interest rate portion (6.75%) and
a floating rate portion (4.75% plus 12-month Euribor). Interest from the fixed-rate portion is capitalised, while
floating-rate interest is paid quarterly.

- Two tranches of floating rate bank loans. Interest is paid monthly. The first tranche (A) is repayable based on
half-yearly repayments until maturity in 31 January 2017, with the outstanding amount under the loan at

F-118


-----

31 December 2012 (€86,172 thousand) bearing interest at a floating rate of 1-month Euribor plus a margin of 4.5%.
The second tranche (B) is repayable in full on 31 January 2018, with the outstanding amount under the loan at
31 December 2012 (€101,008 thousand) bearing interest at floating rate of 1-month Euribor plus a margin of 5%.

- The Group also has a €70 million capex facility, €58,903 thousand of which had been drawn down at
31 December 2012, which bears interest at a floating rate. This facility is repayable in seven half-yearly instalments,
the first of which is due in July 2014. The undrawn portion is subject to a 1.80% commitment fee.

- The Group has a second €70 million capex facility, which has not been drawn down and is subject to a 1.80%
commitment fee.

- The Group also has a €10 million revolving credit facility, which has not been drawn down and is subject to a 1.80%
commitment fee.

The Group’s subsidiaries have local medium-term credit facilities.

This analysis does not take account of interest rate hedging instruments.

**6.16.2 Debt covenants**

The main financial liabilities are subject to certain conditions applied to the consolidated financial statements and notably
the ratio of net debt to gross operating profit (or EBITDA).

Following the refinancing operation of January 2013, the debt covenants relating to the Group’s borrowings were no
longer applicable (see notes 6.2, 6.16.1 and 6.31).

Further to the January 2013 bond issue, the company must comply with three new consolidated debt covenants (on a
proforma basis): a net debt ratio and interest coverage ratio on its high-yield bonds and interest expense.

**6.27.1 Financial risk management**

**_6.27.1.1 Introduction_**

The Group has exposure to the following risks arising on its financial instruments:

- Credit risk

- Liquidity risk

- Market risk

This note presents information on the Group’s exposure to each of the above- mentioned risks, and its objectives, policies
and procedures for measuring and managing risk, and capital management.

**_6.27.1.2 Risk management framework_**

The Supervisory Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management
framework.

The Group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set
appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to predetermined limits. Risk management
policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The
Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a rigorous and effective control
environment in which all employees understand their roles and responsibilities.

The Audit Committee oversees implementation of Group risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.

**6.27.2 Credit risk**

Credit risk is managed at Group level. It is the risk of financial loss for the Group if a client or counterparty should fail to
meet its contractual payment obligations.

Credit risk concerns cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial
institutions, as well as exposure to customer credit risk on outstanding receivables.

In the specialised clinical pathology business, the collection of receivables from direct patients, which are more than
35 days overdue, is handled by a debt collection company acting solely as a collection agent on behalf of Cerba.
Impairment policies for receivables are implemented on the basis of historical data.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit management processes.

The Group put in place a factoring agreement in February 2012. Its contractual conditions do not make it possible to
conclude that the main risks and rewards related to the assigned receivables have actually been transferred to the factor as
the related credit risk is not transferred. The trade receivables are therefore retained in the financial statements and stand
at €59 million at 31 December 2012, and include €13.9 million transferred to the third party factor.

The carrying amount of loans and receivables represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.

**Total receivables, gross..............** **64,060** **60,882** **2,106** **1,073**

**_6.27.2.1 Trade and other receivables_**

The Group believes that it is neither exposed to material credit risk nor to over dependence on a specific customer due to
its broad customer base, with customers located mainly in Europe.

**_6.27.2.2 Impairment losses_**

At 31 December 2012, impairment allowances on trade and other receivables amounted to €3,742 thousand, broadly in
line with the end-2011 amount of €3,624 thousand. Provisions for impairment are mainly related to Cerba’s operations.

**6.27.3 Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk of the Group encountering difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled in cash or other financial assets. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure,
as far as possible, that it always has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and
“challenging” conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or damaging the Group’s reputation.

The following are the undiscounted contractual cash flows required to settle financial liabilities, including estimated

(1) The first column refers to the carrying amount

For loans and borrowings at floating rates, interest payments were calculated on the basis of floating rates at the reporting
date, i.e., margin plus+ 1-month Euribor at 0.109% for 2012 and margin plus+ 1-month Euribor at 1.197% for 2011.

**6.27.4 Market risk**

Market risk includes the risk of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity
instrument prices affecting the Group’s profit or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk
management is to contain market risk exposures within acceptable thresholds, while optimising returns.

**_6.27.4.1 Currency risk_**

The Group’s financial performance is not materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations since a significant portion of
operations takes place within the eurozone and income and expenses are generally denominated in the same currency.

The following exchange rates were used during the period for the main currencies:

**Average rate**

**Exchange rate at** **Average rate** **Exchange rate at** **from 1 January to**

ZAR Rand ........................... 11.1727 10.5545 10.483 10.093


**_6.27.4.2 Interest rate risk_**

Some of the loans taken out by the Group bear interest at floating rates.

The Group contracts interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate risk. This only concerns Laboratoire Cerba and
Cerba European Lab.

The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its floating interest rate bank loans. At 31 December 2012, the
Group hedged €304 million of its floating-rate loans with pay fixed-rate swaps (versus €301 million at
31 December 2011).

The carrying amount of the derivative financial instruments used to hedge interest rate risk is presented below:

These interest rate swaps are economic hedges of interest rate risk on loans and borrowings; they have not been
designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

Following the refinancing operation on 31 January 2013, most of the hedging contracts (for a nominal amount of
€480 million) were terminated. The cash outflow linked to this operation amounted to €4.4 million, generating a profit of
€0.8 million due to changes in the fair value of these swaps in January 2013.

**6.27.5 Capital management**

The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base to ensure the Group’s independence and support future
development of the business. Capital consists of ordinary shares, non-redeemable preference shares and retained
earnings. The Supervisory Board monitors the return on equity.

**6.27.6 Carrying amounts and fair values**

-----

The fair value of trade receivables and trade payables is the amount reported in the statement of financial position, given
the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The same applies to other receivables and payables.

The fair value of swaps corresponds to their valuation by their issuing bank. Financial liabilities are recognised at
amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s bank loans are contracted at variable rates based on
Euribor and their fair value is deemed to correspond to their value at the closing date.

**_6.27.6.2 Fair value hierarchy_**

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been
defined as follows:

- Level 1: fair value is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

- Level 2: fair value is measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e. inferred from observable prices).

- Level 3: fair value is measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).

**Financiere Gaillon 12**

**Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements**
For the period from July 15, 2010 to December 31, 2011

To the Shareholders

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your articles of association and your Shareholders’meeting, we
hereby report to you, for the period from July 15, 2010 to December 31, 2011, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of FINANCIÈRE GAILLON 12;

- the justification of our assessments;

- the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Management Board. Our role is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

**I—Opinion on the consolidated financial statements**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of
selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2011 and of the results of its operations for the period then ended in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**II—Justification of our assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (“code de commerce”) relating to
the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matter:

**_Accounting estimates_**

In preparing its financial statements, your company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the value of certain
assets, liabilities, incomes and charges. These estimates are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements as of December 31, 2011 as described in Note 6.2.4 “Use of estimates and judgements” to the consolidated
financial statements.

Specifically, your company carried out impairment tests on goodwill in accordance with the methods described in
Note 6.10 “Goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements. We reviewed the methods applied to implement these
impairment tests and also the assumptions and estimates applied by the company to determine the values in use, and
verified that the above-mentioned note provide appropriate disclosure.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore
contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

**III—Specific verification**

As required by law, we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information
presented in the Group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

Neuilly-sur-Seine and Paris, on 3 May 2012

**6 Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**6.1** **Reporting entity**

Financière Gaillon 12 is a French private limited liability company (Société par Actions Simplifiée) with a Management
Board and Supervisory Board, domiciled in France. The address of the Company’s registered office is 7/11 Rue de
l’Equerre 95310-Saint Ouen l’Aumône.

Financière Gaillon 12 SAS (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) was created on 8 June 2010 in connection with the
takeover of Cerba European Lab.

The Company’s first financial reporting period began on 8 June 2010 and ended on 14 July 2010.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company at and for the year ended 31 December 2011 comprise the
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group” and individually as “Group
entities”). The Group is a leading European player in medical biology, with a market positioning in clinical laboratory
testing, specialised clinical pathology and clinical trials.

The Group’s first consolidated financial statements are based on an extraordinary seventeen-and-a-half-month period,
from 15 July 2010 to 31 December 2011. Consequently, no comparative financial statements are presented.

Cerberus Nightingale 2 S.A. holds an 81.53% stake in the Company.

**6.2** **Basis of preparation**

**6.2.1 Statement of compliance**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the IASB, as approved by the European Union at 31 December 2011. A detailed
presentation is available on the following website: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_fr.htm.

As the Group is not concerned by the European Union’s exclusion of IAS 39 on Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement, these consolidated financial statements are also compliant with the IFRS issued by the IASB.

**IFRS revisions, amendments and interpretations applicable as of 1 January 2011:**

The new standards and interpretations applicable as of 1 January 2011 as well as improvements to IFRS issued in
May 2010 (listed below) were applied by the Group in its first consolidated financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2011, but had no impact on the latter:

- Revised version of IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”—State- Controlled Entities and the Definition of a
Related Party;

- Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation”—Classification of Rights Issues”;

- Amendments to IFRIC 14 “IAS 19—The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and
their Interaction”—Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement;

- IFRIC 19 “Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments”;

- Improvements to IFRS published in May 2010.

**New IFRS, revisions of IFRS and interpretations published by the IASB but not yet applicable or not applied**
**early by the Group:**

- Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”—Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive
Income;

- Amendments to IAS 12 “Income taxes”—Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets;

- Amendments to IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”—Defined Benefit Plans;

F-145


-----

- Amendments to IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments—Disclosures”—Transfers of Financial Assets;

- Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments—Presentation” and IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments—Disclosures”—
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities;

- IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”—Classification and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities;

- IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”;

- IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements”;

- IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”;

- IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”;

- Revised IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements”;

- Revised IAS 28 “Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures”;

- IFRIC 20 “Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine”.

The Group is currently evaluating the impact of the first-time adoption of these new texts.

The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Supervisory Board on 6 April 2012.

They will be submitted for approval at the Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting on 29 June 2012.

**6.2.2 Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial
instruments, which are measured at fair value.

**6.2.3 Functional and presentation currency**

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial
information presented in euros has been rounded to the nearest thousand, except where otherwise specified.

**6.2.4 Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

Assumptions and estimates mainly concern:

- The measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill (assumptions described in paragraph “6.4 Goodwill”;

- The measurement of obligations related to defined benefit plans (assumptions described in paragraph
“6.20 Employee Benefits”;

- The measurement of deferred tax assets (see Note 6.14.3).

**6.3** **Significant accounting policies**

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial
statements, and have been applied systematically by all Group entities.

F-146


-----

**6.3.1 Basis of consolidation**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements include those of the parent company and all its subsidiaries at and for the
year ended 31 December 2011. The reporting date for all subsidiaries is 31 December.

**_6.3.1.1 Business combinations_**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which
control is transferred to the Group.

The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

- the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus

- the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, plus

- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquire, less

- the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is
classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent
changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

**_6.3.1.2 Acquisitions of non-controlling interests_**

Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and
therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do
not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.

**_6.3.1.3 Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

French legislation requires laboratories to be incorporated as private practice companies (Société d’Exercice Libéral—
SEL) and the clinical pathologists operating the private practice companies to hold over 50% of voting rights at
Shareholders’ Annual General Meetings. In strict compliance with these regulatory constraints, the Group has set up a
capital structure to meet these obligations and hold the majority of the economic interests. Moreover, specific clauses,
namely with regard to governance, are included in the articles of association and shareholder agreements.

Although the Group does not hold the majority of voting rights in the private practice companies, the above-mentioned
mechanisms allow it to obtain the majority of the economic benefits and also to demonstrate the existence of control,
while being in full compliance with French legislation, therefore enabling the French entities to be fully consolidated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

**_6.3.1.4 Loss of control_**

On the loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests
and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any profit or loss arising on the loss of control is recognised
in the income statement. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair
value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an
available-for-sale financial asset depending on the level of influence retained.

F-147


-----

**_6.3.1.5 Transactions eliminated on consolidation_**

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated
in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

**_6.3.1.6 Foreign currency transactions_**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies of the respective Group entities at the
exchange rates effective at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
at the reporting date are converted into the functional currency using the exchange rate effective at that date.

Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in profit or loss.

**_6.3.1.7 Foreign operations_**

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are
translated into euros using the exchange rate effective at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign
operations are translated into euros using the average exchange rates for the financial year.

Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in other items of comprehensive income, and are presented in the
foreign currency translation reserve in equity. When a foreign operation is sold and there is a loss of control, the
cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to the foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss.

**6.3.2 Financial instruments**

**_6.3.2.1 Non-derivative financial assets_**

The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date that they are originated. All other financial assets are
recognised initially on the transaction date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions
of the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in such transferred financial assets that is created or retained
by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and
only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial
recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any
impairment losses.

Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three months or less from the
acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and which are used by the Group in
the management of its short-term commitments.

**_6.3.2.2 Non-derivative financial liabilities_**

The Group initially recognises debt securities and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are originated. All other
financial liabilities (including liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the
trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.

F-148


-----

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities under the other financial liabilities category. Such financial
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial
recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other payables.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as
a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows.

**_6.3.2.3 Share capital_**

_Ordinary shares_

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of
any tax effects.

_Preference shares_

Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable, or redeemable only at the Company’s option, and
any dividends are discretionary. Dividends thereon are deducted directly from equity after approval by the Company’s
shareholders at their general meeting.

All the preference shares issued by the Group meet the definition of equity instruments.

_Share-based payment_

On 21 July 2010, the Company issued shares with warrants. The shares with warrants were granted to senior executives
and some Group employees.

The issues were recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. In accordance
with IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” the warrants were measured at fair value on the grant date.

The fair value measurement of stock options takes into account the exercise price and the expected life of the option, the
price of the underlying stock at the grant date, the expected volatility of the stock price, the expected dividends on the
stock and the risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.

This method makes it possible to determine a fair value of warrants that is equal to their issue price. The shares with
warrants are therefore classified as equity at their issue cost. Since the issue price is equal to the grant-date fair value, the
corresponding expense in the income statement is nil.

**_6.3.2.4 Compound financial instruments_**

Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible bonds denominated in euros that can be
converted into a fixed number of shares at the option of the holder.

The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability
that does not have a conversion option, by discounting the contractual cash flows based on a market rate. The equity
component is recognised initially as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible bonds and
the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity
components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured
subsequent to initial recognition.

Interest and any gains and losses related to the financial liability are recognised in profit or loss. On conversion, the
financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised.

**_6.3.2.5 Derivative financial instruments_**

The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. The derivative financial
instruments held are interest rate swaps. The derivative financial instruments are not designated as hedging instruments in

F-149


-----

a hedging relationship as set out in IAS 39. Consequently, changes in their fair value are directly recognised in profit
or loss.

**6.3.3 Property, plant and equipment**

**_6.3.3.1 Recognition and measurement_**

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When components of property, plant
and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant
and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the difference between the net
proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.

F-150


-----

**_6.3.3.2 Subsequent costs_**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the
expenditure will flow to the Group. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

**_6.3.3.3 Depreciation_**

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the estimated useful
lives of each component. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is
reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and are ready for use, or in
respect of self-constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

- Buildings 20 years

- Plant and equipment 5 - 10 years

- Fixtures and fittings 5 - 10 years

- Equipment and tooling 5 years

- Transport equipment 4 - 5 years

- Office and IT equipment 3 - 5 years

- Furniture 5 - 10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted where
appropriate.

**6.3.4 Intangible assets and goodwill**

**_6.3.4.1 Goodwill_**

Goodwill that arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets. For the measurement of
goodwill at initial recognition, see Notes 6.5 and 6.10.

_Subsequent measurement_

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) or Group(s) of CGUs
that are expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combination.

The CGUs or group of CGUs identified by the Group are as follows:

- Specialised clinical pathology CGU: this involves performing complex clinical testing and/or testing requiring
specific equipment that clients (hospitals, clinics, private or community laboratories) do not have.

- France private clinical laboratory testing CGU and Belux private clinical laboratory testing CGU.

- Clinical trial CGU: this involves conducting clinical trials (logistics, analyses, results) for pharmaceutical companies
and biotechnology firms during the drug development phase.

**_6.3.4.2 Research and development_**

Expenditure on research activities to gain new scientific and technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in
profit or loss as incurred.

Development expenditure is expensed insofar as the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset, defined by IAS 38, are
not met.

F-151


-----

**_6.3.4.3 Other intangible assets_**

Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

They include customer relationships and order books identified when business combinations were concluded during
the year.

**_6.3.4.4 Subsequent expenditure_**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset
to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

**_6.3.4.5 Amortisation_**

Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over their estimated useful
lives, from the date that they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:

- Patents and trademarks 10 years

- Software 1 to 3 years

- Customer relationships (Specialised clinical pathology CGU) 19 years

- Order book (Clinical trials CGU) 4 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted where
appropriate.

**6.3.5 Leased assets**

Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to
the asset.

Other leases are operating leases and are not recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position.

_Lease payments_

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, and as a reduction of rental
expense over the term of the lease.

Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of
the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

**6.3.6 Inventories**

Finished goods inventories, mainly comprising reagents and consumables, are recognised at their acquisition-date cost,
plus any directly attributable costs. They are measured on a VAT-inclusive basis less the applicable pro rata
VAT amounts.

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in
first-out method.

F-152


-----

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of
completion and selling expenses.

**6.3.7 Impairment**

**_6.3.7.1 Non-derivative financial assets_**

A financial asset not classified as at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence of
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and the loss event(s)
have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset that can be estimated reliably.

_Financial assets measured at amortised cost_

The Group considers evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost (loans and receivables) at
both a specific asset and collective level.

The high volumes and low unit values of the invoices issued by the Group require specific credit management processes.
Impairment policies for receivables have been implemented on the basis of historical trends. However, impairment
allowances are allocated specifically. In specialised clinical pathology laboratories, the collection of receivables from
direct patients, which are more than 35 days overdue, is handled by a debt collection company.

In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, the timing of collection
and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted based on management’s judgement as to whether current economic and credit
conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or less than those suggested by historical trends.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Losses are recognised in profit or loss under
“Net change in amortisation and impairment” and are recorded in an allowance account for loans and receivables. When
an event occurring after the impairment was recognised causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

**_6.3.7.2 Non-financial assets_**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at
each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s
recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An
impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash- generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable
amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Assets are
grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the CGUs to
which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the
lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination
is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying
amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

**6.3.8 Employee benefits**

In accordance with the laws and practices of the countries in which it operates, the Group grants its employees
post-employment benefits (pension plans) and other long-term benefits (long-service bonuses).

F-153


-----

**_6.3.8.1 Defined benefit plans_**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the
amount of future benefit that employees have vested in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The
benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of plan assets
are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates
approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are
expected to be paid.

The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The Group
recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income.

**_6.3.8.2 Other long-term employee benefits_**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than pension plans is the amount of future
benefits vested by employees in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The benefits mainly comprise
seniority bonuses.

**_6.3.8.3 Short-term employee benefits_**

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid in short-term cash bonuses or incentive- based
profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay the amount as a result of past
service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**6.3.9 Provisions**

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can
be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised
under finance costs.

**_6.3.9.1 Restructuring_**

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the
restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provisioned.

**6.3.10 Revenue**

**_6.3.10.1 Services_**

Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and any contractual volume discounts for hospitals.

Specialised clinical pathology and private clinical testing operations are carried out via clinical laboratories. Revenue
related to analyses/tests carried out is recognised when the report is validated by the clinical pathologist (date results are
handed over to the client).

Clinical trials are governed by contractual agreements providing for specific invoicing at each stage. Revenue is
recognised using the percentage-of- completion method. Percentage of completion is measured on the basis of
work performed.

**6.3.11 Government grants**

The French government subsidises screening for Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). It contributed €5 for each
test until 31 December 2010 and has contributed €8 for tests performed since 1 January 2011.

This grant is recognised as other income once the Group is eligible to receive it (when the tests have been performed).

F-154


-----

**6.3.12 Finance income and finance costs**

Net finance costs comprise:

- gross finance costs, including interest expense and gains and losses on interest-rate derivatives allocated to gross
financial debt when they qualify for hedge accounting;

- income from cash and cash equivalents, which comprises the return on cash investments and cash equivalents.

Other financial income and expense mainly comprise foreign exchange gains and losses and changes in fair value of
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

**6.3.13 Income tax**

Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss unless it relates
to a business combination, or to items that are recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable profit or tax loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. Deferred tax is not
recognised for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit;

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that it is probable that
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Company takes into account the impact of uncertain tax
positions and any additional taxes and interest that may be due.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets
and they relate to taxes levied by the same authority, either on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities that
intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, and realise their tax assets and settle their tax liabilities
simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax credits, tax losses and deductible temporary differences to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that taxable profit will
be realised.

The Group found that the tax changes introduced by the 2010 French Finance Law mainly consist of changes to the way
French regional tax is calculated, without affecting the nature of the tax. The Group therefore found that there is no
reason to apply a different accounting treatment from that used for business tax (taxe professionnelle) to the French value
added business tax (CVAE) and property business tax (CFE). Consequently, these two taxes are classified under
operating expenses.

- _Transmission Universelle de Patrimoine (merger by dissolution, without liquidation, and transfer of all assets_
and liabilities)

Companies acquired in 2011 through the transfer of assets and liabilities and dissolution without liquidation have been
presented in the consolidation scope as they were acquired during the financial year, with the exception of Genazur,
Bioanalyse and Latour.

**6.5** **Change in consolidation scope**

On 21 July 2010 Financière Gaillon 12 (FG12) fully acquired Cerba European Lab (CEL). CEL is a leading European
player in medical biology, with a market positioning in private clinical testing, specialised clinical pathology and clinical
trials.

Goodwill was recognised as follows on the purchase of the CEL Group:

F-156

**(In millions of euro)** **CEL**
**Net assets acquired (liabilities assumed)** ............................................................................................................ **(360.4)**

**Acquisition price ..................................................................................................................................................** **137.3**
**Goodwill................................................................................................................................................................** **409.6**

Customer relationships have been recognised for the specialised clinical pathology activity and the order book relating to
the clinical trials activity has been measured.

The fair value of customer relationships and the order book acquired in the business combination was determined using
the multiple-period excess earnings method.

Under this approach, the excess earnings attributable to assets are measured by calculating the following:

- Operating margin after tax attributable to the assets or EBIT;

- Capital expense on intangible assets and plant, property and equipment required for operations (working capital
requirement, pre-existing plant, property and equipment, intangible assets and human capital).

Expenses in respect of this takeover were recognised in operating expenses and amounted to €10.7 million.

**6.5.1 Acquisition of the entire share capital of the LLAM group**

On 30 June 2011, Financière Gaillon 12 (FG12) fully acquired the private laboratory LLAM—Laboratoire
Luxembourgeois d’Analyses Médicales.

Goodwill was recognised as follows on the purchase of the LLAM Group:

**(In millions of euro)** **LLAM**
**Net assets acquired ..............................................................................................................................................** **1.2**
Cancellation of commercial goodwill.................................................................................................................... (2.6)
**Net assets acquired (liabilities assumed) restated at fair value........................................................................** **(1.4)**

**Acquisition price ..................................................................................................................................................** **62.5**
**Goodwill................................................................................................................................................................** **63.9**

LLAM Group’s contribution to CEL Group revenue and profit for the year was €14.1 million and €3.3 million
respectively.

**6.5.2 Other acquisitions of controlling interests**

The Group’s other acquisitions of controlling interests for the period concerned private clinical laboratories in France and
Belux. The takeovers, taken individually, had no material impact.

The breakdown of goodwill related to these acquisitions is presented in Note 6.10.

The allocation of goodwill to CGUs was as follows:

**Goodwill at** **Change in** **Goodwill at**
**Cash generating units** **15 July 2010** **consolidation scope** **Impairment** **31 December 2011**

Belux clinical laboratory testing CGU 193.8 193.8
Clinical trial CGU............................... 74.9 74.9
**568.3** **568.3**


Impairment tests performed in accordance with IAS 36 were based on the value in use of each CGU calculated using the
Discounted Cash Flow method.

The main assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of the CGUs were as follows:

**Cash flow** **Long-term**
**Cash generating units** **projection period** **Discount rate** **growth rate**

Specialised clinical pathology CGU ........................................ 6 years 9.00% 2.50%
France clinical laboratory testing CGU ................................... 6 years 9.00% 2.50%
Belux clinical laboratory testing CGU..................................... 6 years 9.40% 2.50%
Clinical trial CGU.................................................................... 6 years 10.50% 3.50%

Cash flows were discounted based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated on the basis of expected
return and market risk for each CGU.

The impairment tests performed cover the goodwill presented in this note as well as all operating assets allocated to the
CGUs (intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and components of working capital, net of deferred tax
liabilities).

At year end 2011, the tests showed no impairment loss.

The impairment tests showed that globally the carrying amounts of the tested assets reflect their recoverable value. The
CGU with the lowest ratio of carrying amounts equal to recoverable value is specialised clinical pathology. The
recoverable amount of this CGU would be identical to its carrying amount if the long-term growth rate were 2% and the
discount rate 9.2%.

**6.18.1 Preference shares**

The Series A and B preference shares issued by FG12 in July 2010 have the following features:

- No voting rights (Art. 19.4 of the articles of association);

- No rights to profit (except for the preference dividend), company assets, reserves, distributions and liquidating
dividends (Art. 22.1 of the articles of association);

- Cumulative annual preference dividend equal to 10% of the subscription value of each Series A and B share
calculated as of 21 July 2010 and capitalised annually (Art. 22.1 of the articles of association);

- The Series A and B preference dividends may be adjusted in the event of a market floatation or a loss of controlling
interest (Art. 22.2 of the articles of association);

- No maturity date.

**6.18.2 Ordinary shares**

Each ordinary share carries one voting right at the general meetings of shareholders. Each share entitles its owner to
receive a share of profit, company assets, reserves, distributions and liquidating dividends.

**6.18.3 Warrants**

On 21 July 2010, FG12 issued 16 million shares with warrants for an aggregate nominal value of €160 thousand. Share
premium amounted to €15,840 thousand and warrants to €790 thousand.

F-163


-----

Each share has two warrants attached: warrant 1 valued at € 0.015625 and warrant 2 at €0.03375.

Shares with warrants are reserved for senior executives and some Group company managers, designated by the
Commitments Board. The shares with warrants were issued at fair value as determined by an expert. The warrants were
measured at the grant-date fair value, which corresponds to their issue price. Since the issue price is equal to the
grant-date fair value, no expense was recognised under IFRS 2.

**6.18.4 Dividends**

While all subsidiaries have a 12-month financial year ending on 31 December, FG12’s first financial period lasted for
18 months. Consequently, the dividends paid by the subsidiaries in 2011 from profit for financial year 2010 were
eliminated, but have been recognised in the income statement for the 18-month period from 15 July 2010 to
31 December 2011.

The financing set up when the Group was created was as follows:

- convertible and non-convertible bonds, most of which bear interest at 10%, expiring on 21 July 2025. Interest is
capitalised annually.

- a bond with warrants (mezzanine) expiring on 31 July 2018. This bond has a fixed interest rate portion (6.75%) and a
floating rate portion (4.75% + 12-month Euribor). Interest from the fixed-rate portion is capitalised, while floating
rate interest is paid quarterly.

- Two tranches of floating rate bank loans. Interest payments are due monthly. The first tranche (A) is repaid based on
a half-yearly repayment schedule until 31 January 2017. The second tranche (B) is repayable in full on
31 January 2018.

- The Group also has a Capex facility of €70 million, €41,589 thousand of which had been used at 31 December 2011,
bearing interest at a variable rate. This credit facility is repayable in seven half-yearly instalments, the first of which
is due on 31 January 2014. It bears interest at a floating rate. The non-utilised portion is subject to a 1.80%
commitment fee.

- The Group also has a revolving credit facility of €10 million, which has not been used and is subject to a 1.80%
commitment fee.

The Group’s subsidiaries have local medium-term credit facilities.

**6.24.1 Financial risk management**

**_6.24.1.1 Introduction_**

The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:

- Credit risk;

- Liquidity risk;

- Market risk;

This note presents information on the Group’s exposure to each of the above- mentioned risks, and the Group’s
objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk, along with capital management.

**_6.24.1.2 Risk management framework_**

The Supervisory Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management
framework.

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set
appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems
are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training
and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a stringent and constructive control environment in which all
employees understand their roles and obligations.

The Group’s Audit Committee oversees management’s implementation of the Group’s risk management policies and
procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.

F-167


-----

**6.24.2 Credit risk**

Credit risk is managed at Group level.

Credit risk concerns cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial
institutions, as well as exposure to customer credit risk, including outstanding receivables.

The carrying amount of loans and receivables represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.

The high volumes and low unit values of invoices issued by the Group require specific credit management processes.
Impairment policies for receivables have been implemented on the basis of historical trends. However, impairment
allowances are allocated specifically. In specialised clinical pathology laboratories, the collection of receivables from
direct patients more than 35 days overdue is handled by a debt collection company acting solely as a collection agent on
behalf of Cerba.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk
at the reporting date was as follows:

**Maturities of receivables**
**(In thousands of euro)** **31 December 2011** **< 1 year** **1 to 5 years** **Over 5 years**
Trade receivables................................................... 56,765 53,141 3,624 0
Social security receivables..................................... 183 183 0 0
Tax receivables...................................................... 2,967 2,967 0 0
Other receivables ................................................... 3,936 2,400 463 1,073
Advances and downpayments paid........................ 217 217 0 0
Deferred tax assets................................................. 913 913 0 0
Prepaid expenses.................................................... 5,912 5,912 0 0
**Gross total ............................................................** **70,893** **65,733** **4,087** **1,073**

**_6.24.2.1 Trade and other receivables_**

The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date was low. The Group’s
customers are mainly located in Europe. Provisions for impairment mainly concerned Cerba’s operations.

**_6.24.2.2 Impairment losses_**

The movement in impairment of trade and other receivables has been very slight since 30 June 2010 (€3,624 thousand at
31 December 2011 compared with €3,046 thousand at 30 June 2010). There is no provision for the impairment of other
receivables.

**6.24.3 Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to
ensure, as far as possible, that it always has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The following are the undiscounted contractual cash flows in respect of financial liabilities, including estimated interest
payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements:

**6.24.4 Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity instrument
prices will affect the Group’s profit or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is
to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns.

**_6.24.4.1 Currency risk_**

The Group’s financial performance is not materially influenced by exchange rate fluctuations since a significant portion
of operations takes place within the euro-zone and costs and income are generally denominated in the same currency.

The following exchange rates were applied during the year for the main currencies:

**Exchange rate at**

**31 December** **Average rate**
AUD Australian dollar............................................................................................ 1.2723 1.34816
USD United States dollar........................................................................................ 1.2939 1.39171
ZAR South African rand......................................................................................... 10.483 10.093

**_6.24.4.2 Interest rate risk_**

Some of the loans taken out by the Group bear interest at floating rates.

The Group enters into interest rate swaps to hedge against the variability of cash flows attributable to interest rate risk.

At 31 December 2011, the FG12 Group was exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its floating interest rate bank loans
and bonds with warrants. At 31 December 2011, the Group hedged €280 million of its floating rate loans and borrowings
with pay fixed-rate swaps.

The carrying amount of the derivative financial instruments used for interest rate risk management is presented below:

**Notional** **Termination** **Fair value at**
**principal** **date** **31 December 2011**

**Pay fixed-rate swap**
3-month Euribor—2.1975% ................................................................ 11,000 05/01/2012 (18)
3-month Euribor—1.9790% ................................................................ 50,000 30/09/2013 (856)
3-month Euribor—1.6% ...................................................................... 190,000 30/09/2013 (1,919)
3-month Euribor—1.25% .................................................................... 40,000 30/09/2013 (158)
3-month Euribor—4.16% .................................................................... 8,078 11/01/2019 (958)
3-month Euribor—2.195% .................................................................. 2,076 26/07/2023 (26)
**Total pay fixed-rate swap..................................................................** **301,154** **(3,935)**
**1-month Euribor pay swap + margin for 3-month Euribor**
1-month Euribor + 0.1730% for 3-month Euribor............................... 100,000 31/03/2012 (327)
1-month Euribor + 0.1725% for 3-month Euribor............................... 100,000 31/03/2012 (57)
1-month Euribor + 0.23% for 3-month Euribor................................... 36,000 31/03/2012 (111)
**Total pay floating-rate swap** ............................................................. **236,000** **(495)**
**Total derivative instruments.............................................................** **(4,430)**


These interest rate swaps are economic hedges of interest rate risk on loans and borrowings; they have not been
designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for floating rate instruments;

An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased interest expense by less than
€200 thousand.

**6.24.5 Capital management**

The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to ensure the Group’s independence and support future
development of the business. Capital consists of ordinary shares, non-redeemable preference shares and retained
earnings. The Supervisory Board monitors the return on equity.

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, and the carrying amounts reported in the statement of financial position,
are as follows:

Other current debt and liabilities.................................................... 4,431 39,595 44,026
**Financial liabilities.......................................................................** **4,431** **75,941** **80,372**


The fair value of trade receivables and trade payables is the amount reported in the balance sheet, given the short-term
nature of these assets and liabilities. The same applies to other receivables and payables.

The fair value of swaps corresponds to their valuation by their issuing bank.

**_6.24.6.2 Fair value hierarchy_**

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been
defined as follows:

- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

**Breakdown by category**
**(In thousands of euro)** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Total**
Liabilities
Derivative instruments........................................................................................ 4,431 4,431
**Total financial liabilities...................................................................................** **0** **4,431** **0** **4,431**

**6.25** **Operating leases**

Operating leases are entered into at the market rate and are not reported as assets at present. The Group intends to
implement procedures in 2012 to enable it to allocate future minimum lease payments.

Lease expenses amounted to €695 thousand at 31 December 2011.

**Statutory auditor’s review report on the consolidated condensed financial statements**
Nine-month period from 1 January to 30 September 2014

To the Chairman,

As statutory auditors of Novescia SAS and following your request in connection with the ongoing process to sell the
group, we conducted a review of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of your company for the ninemonth period from 1 January to 30 September 2014 (“Consolidated Financial Statements”).

These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the responsibility of the Chairman. Our responsibility
is to express a conclusion on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on our review.

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. A review consists primarily of
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other
review procedures. A review is substantially less comprehensive in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
professional standards applicable in France. Consequently, it does not enable us to obtain the same level of assurance that
the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole are free of material misstatements.

Based on our review, no matters have come to our attention that would cause us to believe that the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting
policies set out in the notes to the financial statements.

Without calling into question our conclusion expressed above, we draw your attention to:

- the introduction to the notes specifying that the Consolidated Financial Statements are established in the context of
sale process of the group and, consequently are not prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - the International Financial
Reporting Standard adopted by the European Union for interim financial reporting;

- note 2.3.5 to the explanatory notes specifying the impact of adjustments made following the leases and instruments
agreements’ analysis.

The information contained in this report applies to the context described above and may not be used or disclosed for
other purposes. We decline all responsibility with regard to any third parties to whom the information herein may be
disclosed or communicated.

This report is governed by French law. French courts are solely competent to rule on any dispute, claim or litigation
which may result from our engagement letter or this report, or on any matters pertaining thereto. Both parties hereby
waive all rights to object to any legal proceedings brought before a French court or to claim that the courts in question do
not have jurisdiction over such proceedings.

# Explanatory notes


F-185

**1.1. General information and significant events**

**Introduction**

These financial statements were prepared in the context of the ongoing disposal process of Novescia’s group.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements comprise a consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income
statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of cash flows, consolidated
statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, and explanatory notes and are only related to the period from 1 January to
30 September 2014.

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the disclosures required by IAS 34 “Interim
Financial Reporting”, one of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union.

**1.1.** **General information**

Novescia is a limited liability company incorporated in France. Its registered office is located at 73-77 rue de Sèvres 92100 Boulogne Billancourt.

Novescia’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position of Novescia SAS and its
subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as “the Group”, together with its investments in associates for the period from
1 January to 30 September 2014.

Novescia SAS’s business purpose covers all financial activities performed directly or via third parties, for itself or on
behalf of third parties. It is the parent company of a group which operates in the field of medical diagnostics (clinical
laboratory testing) in France and abroad.

**1.2.** **Significant events**

On 30 January 2014, the Group sold Novescia Côte d’Azur for €9.5 million, generating a capital loss of €0.1 million.

The Group acquired Michelet on 15 July 2014 for €1.2 million, generating goodwill of €0.1 million. Michelet merged
with Novescia Loire on 1 September 2014.

**2. Accounting policies**

**2.1.** **Basis of preparation and accounting standards of interim consolidated financial statements**

The Group has prepared the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the measurement
and recognition principles described in the consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended
31 December 2013, except elements presented in the note 2.3.5 of this document.

The standards applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and that will be applied in the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 prepared in accordance with the international accounting
standards adopted by the European Union will not have significant impact on these consolidated financial statements and
would be without any significant impact on these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, especially taken
into consideration the fact that IFRS 10, 11 and 12 are applied by the Group since the year ended 31 December 2012.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros after rounding.

**2.2.** **Basis of consolidation**

Companies that the Group controls exclusively, directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated.

Acquisitions or disposals during the period are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements from the date that
significant influence or exclusive control commences until the date that significant influence or exclusive control ceases.
Consolidation is based on the financial statements prepared at 30 September 2014.

F-186


-----

**2.3.** **Measurement policies and methods**

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting and
valuation principles presented in the consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended 31 December
2013, except elements presented in the note 2.3.6 of this document.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group’s and subsidiaries’ management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet,
expense and income in the income statement and information in the notes.

The Group’s management makes these estimates and assessments continuously on the basis of past experience and
various other factors considered reasonable. Amounts reported in future financial statements may differ from these
estimates due to changes in assumptions or circumstances.

The main accounting estimates and judgments made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements
are those used to measure items including goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, deferred taxes,
provisions for retirement obligations and provisions for litigation.

**2.3.1. Business combinations**

The revised version of IFRS 3 requires the application of the purchase method for business combinations, which entails
measuring the assets, liabilities and contingent (non-controlling) interests of the acquiree at fair value.

Goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any previously held
interests in the acquiree) less the net recognized amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The acquisition cost is the sum of the consideration transferred, measured at the acquisition-date fair value, and the
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer has to decide how to
measure the portion of the target not acquired, either at fair value or at the amount of its proportionate share of revalued
equity. Acquisition costs are expensed in the period (under “restructuring costs”) during which the related services are
rendered.

Two types of intangible assets have been identified and measured at fair value, namely, lease rights and preferred service
agreements with private health care facilities (clinic contracts).

Negative goodwill is recognized directly in the income statement.

Goodwill is not amortized. The Group performs impairment tests at least once a year at the reporting date and whenever
there is an indication of impairment. When special circumstances (major, structural changes in the technical, regulatory
or market environment, insufficient profitability, etc.) call for it, goodwill impairment is recognized in accordance with
the methodology described below. Such impairment is not reversible.

**2.3.2. Impairment**

Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least once a year at the reporting date and
whenever there is an indication of impairment.

Amortized assets are tested for impairment whenever, due to events or circumstances, the recoverability of their carrying
amount is called into question.

Non-current assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are tested for possible reversal of impairment at each
reporting date.

Goodwill is tested for impairment, which may lead, where appropriate, to writing down the carrying amount to
recoverable value, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The impairment loss is recognized
in “Other non-recurring income and expenses” under “Goodwill impairment.”

Value in use is the present value of the sum of future cash flows before tax and financial items from continuing use of an
asset or CGU and the cash generated by ultimate disposal of the asset.

The discount rate reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset or group
of assets.

F-187


-----

The asset is assessed in its current condition, regardless of the cash flows that may be generated by investments to
improve performance or capacity.

**2.3.3. Intangible assets**

Intangible assets comprise clinic contracts and lease rights resulting from the fair value measurement of company assets
when first consolidated.

The value of clinic contracts in each region was determined using the excess earnings method.

The value of the lease rights of each laboratory was determined using the rental cost method.

Clinic contracts are amortized over a period of 17 years (estimated life of the contracts) and leasehold rights over a
period of 10 to 18 years depending on their capitalization period. Intangible assets also include software, which is
amortized over a period of 3 years.

**2.3.4. Property, plant and equipment**

The Group does not own any real estate. Consequently, it leases the buildings it uses for business purposes. Depreciation
is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each asset according to the following schedule:

- Fixtures and fittings 8 years

- Furniture 8 years

- Equipment and machinery 5 years

- IT equipment 3 years

**2.3.5. Leases**

In accordance with IAS 17 “finance leases”, assets held under leases are capitalized with an offsetting entry under
financial liabilities, when the leases effectively transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets
to the Group.

Leases that do not transfer risks and rewards to the Group are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are
expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

In the first half of 2014, the group analyzed its equipment leases and changed the accounting treatment for:

- leases previously accounted for as operating leases, which have been treated as finance leases in this condensed
consolidated financial statements;

- medical equipment lease arrangements, which do not have the legal form of a lease but must be accounted for as
such in accordance with IFRIC 4. The analysis involved separating the portion of lease payments due for equipment
use from payments due for any other aspects of the arrangement. It also involved determining, in accordance with
IAS 17 criteria, whether the equipment lease part of the arrangement should be accounted for as an operating or
finance lease.
As a result of the analysis, the medical equipment lease arrangements have been restated as “finance leases”.

The main effects of the restatement entries on the interim consolidated financial statements are as follows:

- In the income statement, a decrease in the cost of medical purchases (€0.5 million) and lease expenses (€1.3 million)
and an increase in asset amortization and depreciation (€1.6 million) and financial expense (€0.1 million).

- In the balance sheet, an increase in property, plant and equipment (€5.2 million) and non-current financial liabilities
(€ 5.2 million).

In the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014, the company plans to take into
consideration these restatements on the comparative figures for 2013 and the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2013.

**2.3.6. Other non-current financial assets and liabilities**

Other non-current financial assets and liabilities mainly comprise capital subscribed and not called up, bank loans,
current account assets and liabilities and the non-current portion of security deposits received and given.

F-188


-----

**2.3.7. Inventories**

Inventories primarily comprise consumables and reagents. At the reporting date, they were measured based on the latest
purchase price.

**2.3.8. Trade receivables and other operating receivables**

Receivables and payables in euros are measured at face value.

Trade receivables are written down based on the risk of non-collection, which is estimated entity by entity. The risk is
measured based on the following analyses:

- a review of the statement of unpaid amounts generated by each laboratory’s IT system,

- a review of specific events and circumstances at each laboratory.

**2.3.9. Other current assets and liabilities**

Other current assets and liabilities include receivables and payables on disposals of assets, income receivable and accrued
expenses in connection with dividend payments.

**2.3.10. Other current financial assets and liabilities**

Other current financial assets and liabilities correspond to the current portion (less than one year) of financial assets and
liabilities.

**2.3.11. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank accounts, term deposits of three months or less and marketable
securities.

Accrued interest on term deposits is recognized under financial income.

**2.3.12. Current and non-current loans and borrowings**

Loans and borrowings are recognized at amortized cost less directly-related transaction costs in accordance with IAS 39.
Transaction costs are progressively amortized in profit and loss until the debt has been paid off.

**2.3.13. Current and non-current provisions**

A provision is recognized when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party and it is likely or certain
to result in an outflow of resources to the third party.

Current and non-current provisions are recognized essentially for administrative and industrial tribunal/employee
disputes and proceedings and retirement obligations. Provisions that inherently involve reorganizing and restructuring
operations are classified as restructuring provisions.

**2.3.14. Provision for retirement benefits**

Provisions for retirement benefits are measured based on vested rights, which reflect all the Group’s obligations vis-à-vis
its employees in terms of retirement benefits. The rights are defined by the collective bargaining agreements concerning
the Group.

They are measured using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19.

The provision for retirement benefits is re-measured annually, based on effective rights schedules, changes in the
calculation base, turnover and mortality assumptions and the discount rate.

The provisions (or assets) recognized correspond to the present value of the obligation less the fair value of plan assets
and past service cost and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. The discount rates are set based on the average
risk-free interest rate over a 5-year period.

F-189


-----

Actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in equity in the year they are measured (SORIE method).

At 30 September 2014, 75% of the estimated expense was recognized for financial year 2014.

**2.3.15. Net sales**

Novescia’s net sales are primarily generated by services covered by social security, private health insurance and patients’
payments, based on tariffs set annually by the French government.

**2.3.16. Profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation and other non-recurring income**
**and expenses**

**_2.3.16.1. Profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation_**

Profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation corresponds to the Group’s profit from recurring
operations (excluding income and expenses relating to reorganizing and restructuring operations, which are classified as
other non-recurring income and expenses), before amortization and depreciation. In accordance with IAS 1 (presentation
of financial statements), expenses and provisions included in this income statement line item are disclosed according to
their nature.

The main operating expenses include:

- Medical and other purchases essentially comprising reagents and disposable consumables;

- Personnel costs, which primarily comprise salaries and wages, biologists’ fees, non-salaried workers’ pay, social
security contributions and other personnel costs such as profit sharing and incentive bonuses, less the tax credit to
encourage competitiveness and employment (CICE);

- Other operating expenses primarily comprise professional fees (auditors, lawyers etc.) and subcontracting costs;

- Taxes and duties essentially comprise business property tax (CFE—a component of previous business tax) and
payroll taxes;

- Other operating income and expenses comprise net provisions (trade and related receivables, inventories, employee
disputes, retirement benefits etc.) and allowances for doubtful debt (share attributable to patients etc.);

- Property and equipment lease payments not subject to restatement under IAS 17, which mainly include payments for
business premises and heavy machinery (robots etc.).

**_2.3.16.2. Other non-recurring income and expenses_**

When income and expense items are material and relevant to explaining performance during the period, the company
should disclose their nature and amount separately. These items are aggregated under the line item “other non-recurring
income and expenses”.

As the Group is reorganizing its business activities around regional technical platforms, the costs of restructuring were
recognized under non-recurring expenses. Pooling resources to generate synergies through regional platforms effectively
constitutes restructuring (contract transfers for certain employees, transfer of PPE etc.). The expenses and provisions
classified by nature as relating to restructuring essentially comprise professional fees, costs related to employees not
wishing to be transferred from one site to another, significant contract termination costs and impairment losses for fixed
assets that could not be transferred.

To enhance understanding of profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation, make Group profit
comparable over several periods (avoid mixing several operations/acquisition business models) and present profit from
recurring operations before amortization and depreciation based on the “operator” business model, all acquisition-related
transaction costs have been recognized under other non-recurring expenses.

Generally, other non-current expenses and provisions include non-recurring costs such as the cost of terminating
biologists’ contracts and costs relating to the company’s redundancy plan.

F-190


-----

**2.3.17. Net finance costs**

Net finance costs essentially comprise interest expense paid to banks in connection with loans taken out to fund the
Group’s acquisitions, less income from investments and cash and cash equivalents.

**2.3.18. Other financial income and expenses**

Other financial income and expenses mainly comprise dividends received from companies that were not consolidated.

**2.3.19. Income tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes recognized by each of the Group’s consolidated tax entities.

Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base,
together with tax losses, under the liability method.

Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
the deductible temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
reporting date. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities can be offset if offsetting is legally possible, if the deferred
taxes are levied by the same tax authority and if the Group has the intention to settle current tax amounts on a net basis.

Tax expense is recognized in the income statement unless it concerns items that were directly recognized in shareholders’
equity. In this case, it is recognized in shareholders’ equity.

There is no tax consolidation in the Group.

At 30 September 2014, income tax was calculated by applying a 34.43% rate to consolidated profit before tax.

**3. CONSOLIDATION SCOPE**

At 30 September 2014, the consolidation scope comprised 21 companies compared with 22 at 31 December 2013, as
presented in the note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013:

**Disposals,**

**Change in** **Mergers,**

**Consolidation method** **31 Dec. 2013** **Acquisitions** **method** **Transfers*** **30 Sept. 2014**

Full consolidation ............................. 22 1 — 2 21
**TOTAL ............................................** **22** **1** **0** **2** **21**

The change in consolidation scope was due to the disposal of Novescia Côte d’Azur, and the acquisition of Michelet and
its subsequent merger with Novescia Loire.

**Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements**
Year ended 31 December 2013

To the Shareholders,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us at your annual general meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year
ended 31 December 2013, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Novescia SAS;

- the justification of our assessments;

- the specific verification required by law.

The consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Chairman. Our role is to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

**1 Opinion on the consolidated financial statements**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of
selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2013 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended, in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union.

**2 Justification of our assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of Article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code, we draw your attention to the
following matters:

At each year end, goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” using the
methods described in note 2.4.2 to the consolidated financial statements. We examined the methods used for the
impairment tests, along with the cash flow forecasts and assumptions and we verified that note 5.1 to the consolidated
financial statements provides appropriate disclosures thereon.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore
contributed to the opinion expressed in the first part of this report.

**3 Specific verifications**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**
**At 31 December 2013**

**1. General information and significant events**

**1.1.** **General information**

Novescia is a limited liability company incorporated in France. Its registered office is located at 73-77 rue de Sèvres 92100 Boulogne-Billancourt.

Novescia’s consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position of Novescia SAS and its subsidiaries,
hereinafter referred to as “the Group”, together with its investments in associates. The reporting date of the twelve-month
financial period was 31 December 2013.

Novescia SAS’s business purpose covers all financial activities performed directly or via third parties, for itself or on
behalf of third parties. It is the parent company of a group which operates in the field of medical diagnostics (clinical
laboratory testing) in France and abroad.

The chairman reviewed and approved the financial statements on 6 May 2014. These financial statements shall be
submitted for approval by shareholders at their annual general meeting on 26 June 2014, at which point they could
be modified.

**1.2.** **Significant events**

In February 2013, the Group sold its business operations in the Bordeaux region, Novescia Aquitaine. The sale price was
€7.1 million and the transaction generated consolidated capital gains of €1.3 million. The Group also decided to dispose
of its subsidiary, Novescia Côte d’Azur. The sale was completed on 30 January 2014 and resulted in an impairment loss
of €4.1 million.

The associated assets and liabilities are presented as specific items in the consolidated balance sheet (assets and liabilities
held for sale) in accordance with IFRS 5.

Both sales reflect the Group’s policy of divesting certain non-strategic assets or assets with poor growth potential.

The financial year was marked by the Group’s return to profitability, as a result of streamlining, reorganizing and
resource pooling implemented since late 2011. The Group also began insourcing certain specialties for which domestic
volume warranted the investment, such as Down’s Syndrome and molecular biology.

The improvement in Group profitability resulted in compliance with its bank covenants, none of which were breached.

Consequently, the 2012 reclassification of loans of €53.9 million as current liabilities was no longer required in 2013
(see § 5.3).

The tax credit to encourage competitiveness and employment (CICE) is presented as a deduction in personnel costs in
accordance with IAS 19 and IAS 20. The amount recognized for 2013 was €1.1 million.

A tax dispute regarding intercompany share transfers has been settled and the tax authorities have withdrawn the
adjustment demanded. The provision of €4 million previously recognized was fully reversed. Tax provisions now reflect
the tax normally due (€0.5 million).

**2. Accounting policies**

**2.1.** **Basis of preparation and accounting standards**

In application of European regulations, the Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
international accounting standards applicable in the European Union at 31 December 2013 (IAS/IFRS).

The Group has not made any changes in the application of these standards compared with the previous financial year, nor
has it opted for early adoption, except in the case of IFRS 10.

The Group is currently examining contracts that may merit a change in accounting treatment, such as leases, from
operating leases to finance leases. The impact of the restatement under IAS 17 would be as follows:

F-203


-----

- on the balance sheet, recognition of a long-term leased asset offset by a financial liability;

- on the income statement, cancellation of the related operating expense and recognition of asset depreciation
allowance and a financial expense corresponding to interest on the financial liability.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros after rounding.

**2.2.** **Basis of consolidation**

Companies that the Group controls exclusively, directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated. Companies over which the
Group exercises significant influence are recognized using the equity method.

Company acquisitions or disposals during the year have been accounted for in the consolidated statements from the date
that exclusive control or significant influence commences until it ceases. The consolidation is based on the financial
statements prepared at 31 December 2013.

The list of associates and consolidated subsidiaries is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

**2.3.** **Measurement policies and methods**

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost principle, except for items for which IFRS require
fair value measurement.

The preparation of financial statements requires the Group’s and subsidiaries’ management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, expense and
income in the income statement and information in the notes.

The Group’s management makes these estimates and assessments continuously on the basis of past experience and
various other factors considered reasonable. Amounts reported in future financial statements may differ from these
estimates due to changes in assumptions or circumstances.

The main accounting estimates and judgments made by management in preparing the financial statements are those used
to measure items including goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, deferred taxes, provisions for
retirement obligations and provisions for litigation.

**2.3.1. Business combinations**

The revised version of IFRS 3 requires the application of the purchase method for business combinations, which entails
measuring the assets, liabilities and contingent (non-controlling) interests of the acquiree at fair value.

Goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any previously held
interests in the acquiree) less the net recognized amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The acquisition cost is the sum of the consideration transferred, measured at the acquisition-date fair value, and the
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer has to decide how to
measure the portion of the target not acquired, either at fair value or at the amount of its proportionate share of revalued
equity. Acquisition costs are expensed in the period (under “restructuring costs”) during which the related services
are rendered.

Two types of intangible assets have been identified and measured at fair value, namely, lease rights and preferred service
agreements with private health care facilities (clinic contracts).

Negative goodwill is recognized directly in the income statement.

Under the revised version of IAS 27, acquisitions of non-controlling interests in controlled companies and share transfers
to non-controlling interests without loss of control result in the recognition of the change in equity attributable to the
parent company, reflecting the difference between the cost of acquisition or disposal and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests. For any partial or total disposal with loss of control, the Group recognizes the gain or loss on
disposal in the income statement under other operating income and expenses, along with any effect of re-measuring the
interest retained.

F-204


-----

Goodwill is not amortized. The Group performs impairment tests at least once a year at the reporting date and whenever
there is an indication of impairment. When special circumstances (major, structural changes in the technical, regulatory
or market environment, insufficient profitability, etc.) call for it, goodwill impairment is recognized in accordance with
the methodology described below. Such impairment is not reversible.

**2.3.2. Impairment**

Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least once a year at the reporting date and
whenever there is an indication of impairment.

Amortized assets are tested for impairment whenever, due to events or circumstances, the recoverability of their carrying
amount is called into question.

Non-current assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are tested for possible reversal of impairment at each
reporting date.

Goodwill is tested for impairment, which may lead, where appropriate, to writing down the carrying amount to
recoverable value, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The impairment loss is recognized
in “Other non-recurring income and expenses” under “Goodwill impairment.”

Value in use is the present value of the sum of future cash flows before tax and financial items from continuing use of an
asset or CGU and the cash generated by ultimate disposal of the asset.

The discount rate reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset or group
of assets.

The asset is assessed in its current condition, regardless of the cash flows that may be generated by investments to
improve performance or capacity.

**_2.3.2.1. Cash generating units_**

As defined in IAS 36, a cash generating unit (CGU) is “the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets”.

For Novescia, CGUs are generally determined by the company that operates the laboratory (-ies) (SEL). It is not possible
to determine CGUs more precisely than at laboratory (operating site) level, as the operating sites comprising the
laboratories (SEL) are not independent of one another in terms of cash flow.

For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is tested by aggregating the CGUs that operate in a defined region using the
same technical facilities that are in service or under construction.

The aggregation of CGUs by region is justified by the significant economic dependency of the laboratories on the
regional health agencies (ARS). All organizational decisions are made at this level.

**_2.3.2.2. Groups of cash generating units_**

At 31 December 2013, the Group tested nine groups of CGUs for goodwill impairment:

Novescia Grand Paris, Novescia Normandie, Novescia Nord, Novescia Midi- Pyrénées, Novescia Rhône-Alpes,
Novescia Loire, Novescia Bourgogne, Novescia Provence and Novescia La Réunion.

The entities in the Paris region were aggregated in one CGU because of the high number of shared processes
and activities.

Impairment testing is performed at least once a year prior to the reporting date.

Goodwill impairment of €4.1 million was recognized for Novescia Côte d’Azur due to its value on disposal at
30 January 2014.

**The other CGUs are measured according to the following assumptions:**

F-205


-----

For this measurement, future cash flows were calculated based on forecasts for financial year 2014. The forecasts were
constructed on the basis of the following two assumptions:

- a 1% increase in net sales (supported by the three-year agreement of 0.25% for the market, together with proven
capacity to outperform it);

- a 1% increase in profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation, but this assumption may be
limited if the CGU’s optimum performance depends on its limitations.

To calculate the value in use of the CGU groups, the Group used a discount rate of 9.9%.

The CGUs tested for impairment on the basis of value in use did not show any impairment.

**2.3.3. Intangible assets**

Intangible assets comprise clinic contracts and lease rights resulting from the fair value measurement of company assets
when first consolidated.

The value of clinic contracts in each region was determined using the excess earnings method.

The value of the lease rights of each laboratory was determined using the rental cost method.

Clinic contracts are amortized over a period of 17 years (estimated life of the contracts) and leasehold rights over a
period of 10 to 18 years depending on their capitalization period. Intangible assets also include software, which is
amortized over a period of 3 years.

**2.3.4. Property, plant and equipment**

The Group does not own any real estate. Consequently, it leases the buildings it uses for business purposes.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each asset according to the following
schedule:

- Fixtures and fittings 8 years

- Furniture 8 years

- Equipment and machinery 5 years

- IT equipment 3 years

The depreciation allowance is expensed in each financial year.

**2.3.5. Non-current assets (or groups of assets) held for sale, discontinued operations, sold or being sold**

The Group applies IFRS 5—Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations—which requires specific
recognition and presentation of assets (or groups of assets) held for sale, discontinued operations, and assets sold or
being sold.

Non-current assets or group of assets and associated liabilities are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is
recovered primarily through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. To meet this definition, the asset
(or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the sale must be highly probable. These assets are no longer
amortized from the time that they are defined as assets (or group of assets) held for sale. They are presented as a separate
line item on the balance sheet, without restatement of prior periods.

The loss of control of a subsidiary, or a discontinued operation, sold or being sold, is defined as a component of an entity
with cash flows independent from the rest of the entity and representing a line of business or separate, major region.
Profit from these activities is presented as a separate line item in the income statement.

**2.3.6. Leases**

In accordance with IAS 17 “finance leases”, assets held under leases are capitalized with an offsetting entry under
financial liabilities, when the leases effectively transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets
to the Group.

F-206


-----

Leases that do not transfer risks and rewards to the Group are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are
expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

**2.3.7. Other non-current financial assets and liabilities**

Other non-current financial assets and liabilities mainly comprise capital subscribed and not called up, bank loans,
current account assets and liabilities and the non-current portion of security deposits received and given.

**2.3.8. Inventories**

Inventories primarily comprise consumables and reagents. At the reporting date, they were measured based on the latest
purchase price. There are no significant differences in the measurement policies used compared with IFRS, which require
inventory measurement using the FIFO or AVCO methods.

**2.3.9. Trade receivables and other operating receivables**

Receivables and payables in euros are measured at face value.

Trade receivables are written down based on the risk of non-collection, which is estimated entity by entity. The risk is
measured based on the following analyses:

- a review of the statement of unpaid amounts generated by each laboratory’s IT system,

- a review of specific events and circumstances at each laboratory.

**2.3.10. Other current assets and liabilities**

Other current assets and liabilities include receivables and payables on disposals of assets, income receivable and accrued
expenses in connection with dividend payments.

**2.3.11. Other current financial assets and liabilities**

Other current financial assets and liabilities correspond to the current portion (less than one year) of financial assets and
liabilities.

**2.3.12. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank accounts, term deposits of three months or less and marketable
securities that meet IAS 7 criteria.

Accrued interest on term deposits is recognized under financial income.

**2.3.13. Current and non-current loans and borrowings**

Loans and borrowings are recognized at amortized cost less directly-related transaction costs in accordance with IAS 39.
Transaction costs are progressively amortized in profit and loss until the debt has been paid off.

Borrowings are defined as the sum of:

- loans from credit institutions including accrued interest;

- finance lease liabilities including accrued interest;

- other loans and borrowings and related liabilities;

- financial receivables and liabilities on current accounts.

Net cash and cash equivalents is defined as the sum of:

- cash assets and liabilities;

- marketable securities net of provisions;

F-207


-----

- financial receivables and liabilities on current accounts—cash pooling.

Net debt corresponds to the sum of borrowings less net cash and cash equivalents.

**2.3.14. Current and non-current provisions**

In accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, a provision is recognized when
the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party and it is likely or certain to result in an outflow of
resources to the third party.

Current and non-current provisions are recognized essentially for administrative and industrial tribunal/employee
disputes and proceedings and retirement obligations. Provisions that inherently involve reorganizing and restructuring
operations are classified as restructuring provisions (see note 4.5 Restructuring costs).

**2.3.15. Provision for retirement benefits**

Provisions for retirement benefits are measured based on vested rights, which reflect all the Group’s obligations vis-à-vis
its employees in terms of retirement benefits. The rights are defined by the collective bargaining agreements concerning
the Group.

They are measured using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19.

The provision for retirement benefits is re-measured annually, based on effective rights schedules, changes in the
calculation base, turnover and mortality assumptions and the discount rate.

The provisions (or assets) recognized correspond to the present value of the obligation less the fair value of plan assets
and past service cost and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. The discount rates are set based on the average
risk-free interest rate over a 5-year period.

Actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in equity in the year they are measured (SORIE method).

**2.3.16. Net sales**

Novescia’s net sales are primarily generated by services covered by social security, private health insurance and patients’
payments, based on tariffs set annually by the French government.

**2.3.17. Profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation and other non-recurring income**
**and expenses**

**_2.3.17.1. Profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation_**

Profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation corresponds to the Group’s profit from recurring
operations (excluding income and expenses relating to reorganizing and restructuring operations, which are classified as
other non-recurring income and expenses), before amortization and depreciation. In accordance with IAS 1 (presentation
of financial statements), expenses and provisions included in this income statement line item are disclosed according to
their nature.

The main operating expenses include:

- Medical and other purchases essentially comprising reagents and disposable consumables;

- Personnel costs, which primarily comprise salaries and wages, biologists’ fees, non-salaried workers’ pay, social
security contributions and other personnel costs such as profit sharing and incentive bonuses, less the tax credit to
encourage competitiveness and employment (CICE);

- Other operating expenses primarily comprise professional fees (auditors, lawyers etc.) and subcontracting costs;

- Taxes and duties essentially comprise business property tax (CFE—a component of previous business tax) and
payroll taxes;

- Other operating income and expenses comprise net provisions (trade and related receivables, inventories, employee
disputes, retirement benefits etc.) and allowances for doubtful debt (share attributable to patients etc.);

F-208


-----

- Property and equipment lease payments not subject to restatement under IAS 17, which mainly include payments for
business premises and heavy machinery (robots etc.).

**_2.3.17.2. Other non-recurring income and expenses_**

In accordance with IAS 1 (presentation of financial statements), when income and expense items are material and
relevant to explaining performance during the period, the company should disclose their nature and amount separately.
These items are aggregated under the line item “other non-recurring income and expenses”.

As the Group is reorganizing its business activities around regional technical platforms, the costs of restructuring were
recognized under non- recurring expenses. Pooling resources to generate synergies through regional platforms effectively
constitutes restructuring (contract transfers for certain employees, transfer of PPE etc.). The expenses and provisions
classified by nature as relating to restructuring essentially comprise professional fees, costs related to employees not
wishing to be transferred from one site to another, significant contract termination costs and impairment losses for fixed
assets that could not be transferred.

To enhance understanding of profit from recurring operations before amortization and depreciation, make Group profit
comparable over several periods (avoid mixing several operations/acquisition business models) and present profit from
recurring operations before amortization and depreciation based on the “operator” business model, all acquisition-related
transaction costs have been recognized under other non-recurring expenses.

Generally, other non-current expenses and provisions include non- recurring costs such as the cost of terminating
biologists’ contracts and costs relating to the company’s redundancy plan.

**2.3.18. Net finance costs**

Net finance costs essentially comprise interest expense paid to banks in connection with loans taken out to fund the
Group’s acquisitions, less income from investments and cash and cash equivalents.

**2.3.19. Other financial income and expenses**

Other financial income and expenses mainly comprise dividends received from companies that were not consolidated.

**2.3.20. Income tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes recognized by each of the Group’s consolidated tax entities.

In accordance with IAS 12 “Income tax”, deferred taxes arise from temporary differences in the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities and their tax base, together with tax losses, under the liability method.

Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
the deductible temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
reporting date. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities can be offset if offsetting is legally possible, if the deferred
taxes are levied by the same tax authority and if the Group has the intention to settle current tax amounts on a net basis.

Tax expense is recognized in the income statement unless it concerns items that were directly recognized in shareholders’
equity. In this case, it is recognized in shareholders’ equity.

There is no tax consolidation in the Group.

**_Business tax reform (French Finance Act of 2010)_**

The French Finance Act of 2010 amended business tax, replacing it with a new territorial contribution (CET). It
comprises two components:

- Property business tax (CFE) based on the rental value of property subject to property tax, with characteristics similar
to the previous business tax. It is recognized as an operating expense.

- French value added business tax (CVAE).

As the basis for calculating value added business tax (CVAE) is a net aggregate of income and expenses, the Group has
chosen to recognize CVAE as income tax under IAS 12.2.

Changes in other loans and borrowings were due to the reclassification of the non-current portion of bank loans under
non- current liabilities, as the company reported compliance with bank covenants at 31 December 2013.

**5.10.** **Assets and liabilities held for sale**

**5.11.** **Financial instruments**

**5.11.1. Interest rate risk**

At 31 December 2011, Novescia set up hedging instruments with its primary banking partners (LCL, BECM and BNP
Paribas) in order to hedge the bank loans taken out by its laboratories (acquisition-related debt) through a floating 3month Euribor to fixed-rate swap.

At 31 December 2013, the notional amount by maturity and market value (fair value) recorded for the interest rate
hedging instruments was as follows:

**31 Dec. 2013** **31 Dec. 2013**

**(In EUR)** **2014** **2015** **Beyond** **Notional amount** **Fair value**

BNP ........................................................ 25,131,290 25,131,290 25,131,290 318,872
LCL......................................................... 21,319,052 21,319,052 21,319,052 242,103
BECM..................................................... 19,830,571 19,830,571 19,830,571 238,662
Volume of interest rate hedging
transactions ......................................... 66,280,913 66,280,913 66,280,913 799,637


The “notional amount” represents the amount covered by the interest rate hedge. “Fair value” is the amount payable or
receivable when the hedges are unwound.

All interest rate transactions undertaken by the Group and listed above are hedging transactions.

In accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39, the change in the market value of these instruments at 31 December 2013 was
recognized in financial liabilities with an offsetting entry in shareholders’ equity net of deferred tax for a cumulative
amount of €0.5 million.
