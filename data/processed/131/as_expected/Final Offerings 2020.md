-----

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer
or a solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires
that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and any Initial Purchaser of the securities offered
or any affiliate of such Initial Purchaser is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall
be deemed to be made by such initial purchaser or affiliate on behalf of House of HR NV in such
jurisdiction.

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area or the
United Kingdom (each a ‘‘Relevant State’’). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the
‘‘IDD’’), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II. No key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling any in scope instrument or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in a Relevant State has been prepared. Offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in a Relevant State may be unlawful.

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any person qualifying as a consumer within the meaning of
article I.1, 2� of the Belgian Code of economic law (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de droit
_´economique) dated 28 February 2013, as amended from time to time (i.e., any natural person habitually_
resident in Belgium and acting for purposes which are outside his/her trade, business or profession).

Each person located in a Relevant State to whom any offer of Notes is made, or who receives any
communication in respect of an offer of Notes, or who initially acquires any Notes, or to whom the Notes
are otherwise made available, will be deemed to have represented, warranted, acknowledged and agreed to
and with each Initial Purchaser and the Issuer that (i) it is a ‘‘qualified investor’’ within the meaning of the
law in that Relevant State implementing Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation; and (ii) it is not a retail
investor (as defined above).

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an
offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturer, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration
the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom. In
the United Kingdom, each invitation of inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of Section 21 of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (‘‘FSMA’’)) in connection with the offer
of the securities has only been communicated or caused to be communicated and will only be
communicated or caused to be communicated in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of FSMA does not
apply to us.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, or any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any
difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy
version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties (‘‘ECPs’’) and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional clients
are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject
to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA and UK Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (‘‘EEA’’) or the
United Kingdom (each, a ‘‘Relevant State’’). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID
II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. No key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling
any in scope financial instrument or otherwise making them available to retail investors in any Relevant
State has been prepared. Offering or selling such Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in any Relevant State may be unlawful.

**Prohibition of Sales to Individual Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any individual investor.

If, despite this prohibition, an individual investor succeeds in acquiring and holding the Notes, such
individual investor will not receive any payments on the Notes.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed solely at, persons who (i) are outside
the United Kingdom, (ii) are investment professionals, as such term is defined in Article 19(5) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the ‘‘Financial
**Promotion Order’’), (iii) are persons falling within Articles 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Financial Promotion**
Order, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment banking activity
(within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the ‘‘FSMA’’)) in
connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated or caused to be
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as ‘‘relevant persons’’). This Offering

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**General**

The issuer of the Notes is House of HR NV (the ‘‘Issuer’’). The Issuer is a public limited liability company
(naamloze vennootschap/soci´et´e anonyme) organized under the laws of Belgium having its registered office
at Beversesteenweg 576, 8800 Roeselare and registered with the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises under
number 0643.887.978 RPR/RPM Ghent, section Kortrijk.

The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is the historical consolidated financial
information of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries (the ‘‘Group’’). Accordingly, unless otherwise
stated, all references to ‘‘we’’, ‘‘us’’, ‘‘our’’ or the ‘‘Group’’ in respect of historical financial statements in
this Offering Memorandum are to the Issuer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

This Offering Memorandum includes:

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group (prepared in accordance with IFRS) as of
and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the latter of which includes comparative
information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 2016 (the ‘‘Annual
**Consolidated Financial Statements’’) together with the audit reports thereon by the Group’s**
independent auditors; and

- the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Group (prepared in accordance with
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting) as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which
includes comparative information as of the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2019, which has been subjected to limited review by the Group’s independent
auditors (the ‘‘Interim Consolidated Financial Statements’’ and, together with the Annual
Consolidated Financial Statements, the ‘‘Consolidated Financial Statements’’).

Certain financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been presented for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2020. Such financial information has been computed by adding the results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 derived from the Annual Consolidated Financial
Statements to the results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 and
subtracting therefrom the results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, both
derived from the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Gritt Projects was divested during June 2020
and as a consequence the results of operations in the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the
nine months ended September 30, 2020 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 are
presented excluding the results of Gritt Projects. This divestment was not yet reflected in the results of the
operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 – therefore a correction is made to exclude the results of
Gritt Projects from the results of the fourth quarter of 2019. This data has been prepared solely for the
purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting
and has not been audited or reviewed and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for
such period or for any future period.

Certain financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been presented on the basis of our
business units’ unaudited accounts (the ‘‘business unit accounts’’). Certain of these business units,
accounts may include information from statutory audited accounts, but they are not covered by the audit
reports included in this Offering Memorandum and were prepared on a different basis from our
Consolidated Financial Statements. The business units’ accounts assume that any acquisitions undertaken
that are reported with that business unit were acquired as at January 1, 2017 and that any divestments of
business units were divested as at January 1, 2017 so that the business units’ management can track the
performance of the enlarged business unit post-acquisition on the same basis. Acquisitions may take
several months to integrate into the business unit accounts. Furthermore, the management of the business
units are also responsible for identifying normalizations that should be reflected in the business unit
accounts, both in the statutory information that is integrated from acquisitions and after such acquisition,
as well as within the existing business units operation. We believe our approach on the preparation of our
business accounts facilitates management’s ability to track its key performance indicators, since the impact
of acquisitions and normalizations that occur are eliminated. Financial information prepared on this basis
has been referred to as business unit accounts or _pro forma business unit accounts in this Offering_
Memorandum.

Certain financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been presented using unaudited statutory
or management accounts. Certain of these figures set out in this Offering Memorandum have been

VII


-----

computed by adding the revenues of all of our acquired entities to our historical statutory accounts
(prepared from 2007 to 2015 on a Belgian GAAP basis), to present the total revenues of the Group, as if it
had been operating as a consolidated group at the relevant date (See ‘‘Our Business—Our Strengths—‘‘We
_are well positioned to restart our outstanding record of both organic and external growth.’’). The historical_
financial metrics for the acquired entities have been obtained from their individual accounts, and are
therefore not comparable to our historical financial information. Some of these accounts may not been
prepared in accordance with statutory requirements or the accounting policies used by these acquired
entities may differ in substantial respects from the manner in which we have prepared our accounts. This
financial information may not reflect what our results of operations or financial condition would have been
had the Group operated as a consolidated group or reporting segment during the periods presented. A
number of estimates, judgments and assumptions were made for the purpose of allocating those items that
were not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. This financial information has been presented
for illustrative purposes and does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations had they existed
with our current consolidation perimeter would have been had we been a consolidated entity in the past,
how our financial condition will be in the future or how our operations might respond in the future to
events similar to those experienced by us in the past.

Unless otherwise indicated, the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Offering Memorandum have
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘‘IFRS’’) as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IASB’’) and adopted within in the European Union.

The Group publishes its financial statements in euros. All references to ‘‘$’’, ‘‘U.S. dollars’’, ‘‘USD’’, ‘‘US$’’
or ‘‘dollars’’ are to the lawful currency of the United States. All references to ‘‘E’’, ‘‘euro’’ or ‘‘EUR’’, are to
the lawful currency of the member states of the European Union that have adopted or adopt the single
currency in accordance with the treaty establishing the European Community, as amended. For historical
information regarding rates of exchange between the euro and U.S. dollar, see ‘‘Exchange Rate
_Information’’._

**Other Financial Measures and Ratios**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain financial measures and ratios, including EBITDA, EBITDA
Margin, _Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue,_ _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA,_ _Pro Forma Adjusted Capital_
Expenditure, Normalized Pro Forma Free Cash Flow, Gross Margin, Organic Growth, and certain leverage
and coverage ratios that are not required by, defined under, or presented in accordance with IFRS (the
‘‘Non-IFRS Measures’’).

The Non-IFRS measures are defined by the Group as follows:

- EBITDA—represents operating profit/(loss) plus the income statement line items for depreciation
and amortization, royalties and extraordinary items. The income statement line items net change in
depreciation, amortization and impairment include, among others, depreciation of tangible assets,
provisions for operational risks, disputes, pensions, bad debt, overdue receivables, if any. For a
reconciliation of EBITDA to operating profit/(loss) for the period, see footnote (2) under ‘‘Summary
_Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Pro Forma Information’’._

- EBITDA margin—represents EBITDA divided by revenue.

- _Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue—represents the revenue for the period presented adjusted to reflect_
revenue generated by businesses acquired or divested during that period as if those acquisitions or
divestments had occurred on the first day of the period. _Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for the last_
twelve months ended September 30, 2020 also includes the revenue impact from the acquisitions of
Riviera (A5.5 million) and Stevin (A19.6 million) as if they had occurred on October 1, 2019.

- _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA—represents EBITDA as adjusted for the items set forth in ‘‘Summary_
_Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Pro Forma Information’’._

- _Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure—represents the capital expenditures for the period adjusted_
to reflect capital expenditures incurred by businesses acquired as if the business was acquired on the
first day of the period.

- Normalized _Pro Forma Free Cash Flow—represents_ _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less_ _Pro Forma_
Adjusted Capital Expenditure.

- Gross Margin—represents gross profit/(loss) divided by revenue.

VIII


-----

- Organic Growth—represents revenue growth between one financial period and the comparable prior
period, excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue as follows:

  - in respect of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 (compared against the nine
months ended September 30, 2019), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by
assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019 or that divestments have taken
place as of January 1, 2019;

  - in respect of revenue for 2019 (compared against 2018), we have excluded the impact of
acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2018; and

  - in respect of revenue for 2018 (compared against 2017), we have excluded the impact of
acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2017.

We present Non-IFRS Measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by
certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance
and liquidity. The Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS Measures and ratios are
not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as
alternatives or substitutes to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with
IFRS.

Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our businesses or as measures of cash that will
be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily
on the IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement your evaluation of our
performance.

EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as used in this Offering Memorandum, are
not calculated in the same manner as ‘‘consolidated EBITDA’’ which is calculated pursuant to the
Indenture as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ or for purposes of any of our other indebtedness.
The information presented by Non-IFRS Measures is unaudited and has not been prepared in accordance
with IFRS.

**Non-Financial Operating Data**

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of the Consolidated Financial
Statements or accounting records, and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside auditors,
consultants or experts. A number of our key performance indicators relate to our business units. Our
business units are comprised of a variety of legal entities which are designated as a business unit by us,
typically on the basis of a common (i) management team; (ii) financial reporting unit; and (iii) market
specialization, which may include common specializations, international recruitment network approaches,
end-markets served or geographic presence. Our business units are those presented in the tables in ‘‘Our
_Business—Our Service Offering—Three Staffing Segments and Digital’’ in this Offering Memorandum. The_
Group’s use or computation of these terms may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly
titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of these terms should not be considered in
isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS.

The non-financial operating data are defined by the Group as follows:

- Bench time—represents the time for which job candidates are paid by us but cannot be billed to a
client linked to the unavailability of an assignment and does not include any hours linked to holiday,
internal training or other matters. This also does not include any hours for job candidates that were on
the bench, but that were compensated by furlough measures of the government. Bench time is
expressed as a full time equivalent (‘‘FTE’’) using the working days per month multiplied by eight
hours per day;

- Days sales outstanding or DSO—represents the number of days that it takes to collect payments after
a sale has been made. It is calculated by dividing the accounts receivable with the sales of that month
and the portion of the previous month(s) sales, taking into account applicable VAT rules and taking
into account the number of actual days in those relevant months;

IX


-----

- Unique clients—represent our legal entity or natural person clients for each of the operational entities
that formed part of consolidation perimeter as at the period indicated in this Offering Memorandum.
There may be duplication in the figures if certain operational entities serve the same client or if the
client has multiple legal entities under which it does business and which are served by our various
operational entities;

- In-house full-time equivalent employees—represent our employees that are not intended for client
assignments, such as our sales and marketing in-house employees. Full-time equivalent measures the
number of in-house employees as adjusted to reflect the portion of hours worked in a week. An
in-house employee on a 40-hour work week would represent one in-house full-time equivalent
employee for the period whereas an in-house employee on a 20-hour work week would represent 0.5
full-time equivalent employee for the period;

- Job candidates—include our individuals that we recruit for assignments with clients, whether they be
for temporary staffing positions, secondments or consulting roles; job candidates also refers to our
engineers and consultants, freelancers and subcontractors that are intended for assignments with
clients;

- Job candidates at work or people at work—represent any person that has worked one hour at a client
for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Job candidates
at work include our engineers and consultants, freelancers and subcontractors as well as job
candidates with an indefinite employment agreement with us (whether or not they worked one hour
with a client during the applicable period);

- Productive job candidates—job candidates working at the customer premises, expressed in full time
equivalents;

- Total Market—represents the estimated total market size in 2017 expressed in terms of revenue, which
encompassed the staffing market in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium; the consulting market in
Benelux and France; and the engineering staffing market in Belgium and the Netherlands;

- Addressable Market—represents the portion of our Total Market which has been narrowed down to
reflect the estimated market size, expressed in terms of revenue, for each of our business units
according to the particular staffing, sourcing or consulting services for the particular clients, industrial
and geographic end-markets that each such business unit serves; to narrow the Total Market, we
identified competitors that provide similar services to our own within the niches in which we often
operate and clients or others familiar with the market were consulted; using these additional sources,
the Addressable Market relating to our particular business units were estimated; these estimates have
their limitations and may not align with how other market participants view the size of our niche
markets; and

- market position—represents our share of revenue of the Addressable Market of our business units,
except where otherwise indicated; these market positions are higher than if we were to focus on the
more general and broad markets in which we operate as measured by the Total Market.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. These standards also require management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in the notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information presented
in millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding
adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the
actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods
relating to financial and other information set forth in the ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and are calculated using the unrounded numerical data in_
the Consolidated Financial Statements or the tabular presentation of other information contained in this
Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description
thereof.

**PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the various
markets or regions in which we operate and compete. Unless otherwise stated, all information regarding
markets, market size, market position, growth rates and other industry data contained in this Offering
Memorandum is based on our own estimates about the industry in which we operate, as well as the Issuer’s
analysis of facts and information derived from internal surveys, market research, customer feedback,
publicly available information and industry publications, including from the European Commission, the
World Bank, Staffing Industry Analysts, The Economist Intelligence Unit, Federgon, Prism’Emploi,
Statistik der Bundesagentur f¨ur Arbeit, ABU (Algemene Bond Uitzendondernemingen), Dutch
Federation of Private Employment Agencies and services provided to us by The Boston Consulting Group.
Third-party sources generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources
believed to be reliable, but some of the information may have been derived from estimates or subjective
judgments or may have been subject to limited audit or validation. While we believe this market data and
other information to be accurate and correct and we have taken reasonable actions to ensure that the
industry and market data cited herein has been extracted accurately and used in its proper context, we have
not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources or ascertained the underlying economic
assumptions relied upon therein. Such estimates or judgments, particularly as they relate to expectations
about our market and industry, involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to the limitations described
below as well as to change based on various factors, including those discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and
‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’ elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

We cannot assure you that any of the assumptions underlying any statements regarding the employment
services industry are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry. Market data and statistics are
inherently predictive and speculative and are not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such
statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both
the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions
should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of statistics for different
markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined differently, (ii) the underlying
information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in compiling
the data. Accordingly, the market statistics included in this Offering Memorandum should be viewed with
caution and no representation or warranty is given by any person, including us or the Initial Purchasers, as
to their accuracy.

Certain of the publications, surveys and studies referred to in this Offering Memorandum were conducted
or published before the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore do not reflect any past, present or future impact
of Covid-19 on any specific market or globally, unless otherwise indicated.

Certain statements regarding the employment services industry are not based on published statistical data
or information obtained from independent third-parties, but are based solely on our experience, our
internal studies and estimates, and our own investigation of market conditions at the time of this Offering
Memorandum. We believe these estimates to be accurate as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.
However, this information may prove to be inaccurate because of the methods by which we obtained some
of the data for these estimates or because this information cannot always be verified with complete
certainty due to the limits on the availability and availability of raw data and other factors; and accordingly,
neither we, the Initial Purchasers nor any third-party sources can guarantee the accuracy or completeness
of this information, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified this information.
Neither we, the Initial Purchasers nor any third-party source assumes responsibility for the correctness of
any business or market data included in this Offering Memorandum. We cannot assure you that these
studies or estimates are accurate, and none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any
independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding our estimates presented
herein, our estimates involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties and are subject to change based on
various factors, including those discussed under the heading ‘‘Risk Factors’’ this Offering Memorandum.

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated below, the high, low, average and period-end
Bloomberg Generic Composite Rates expressed in U.S. dollars per A1.00. The Bloomberg Generic
Composite Rate is a ‘‘best market’’ calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the
highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by
these banks. The Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid
rate and the lowest ask rate. The rates below may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of
the consolidated financial statements and other financial information appearing in this Offering
Memorandum. We make no representation that the euro or U.S. dollar amounts referred to in this
Offering Memorandum have been, could have been or could, in the future, be converted into U.S. dollars
or euro, as the case may be, at any particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate on the last
business day of each month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for a shorter period, means the
average of the daily Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate during that month, or shorter period, as the case
may be.

The Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate of the euro on December 10, 2020 was $1.2081 per A1.00.

We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our
actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which

contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition

indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

Any forward-looking statement that we make in this Offering Memorandum speaks only as of the date on

Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or
indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events

competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not
possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties,
you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We
urge you to read the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled ‘‘Presentation of Industry and Market
_Data’’, ‘‘Summary’’, ‘‘Risk Factors’’, ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations’’ and ‘‘Our Business’’ for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect_
our future performance and the markets in which we operate.

**Overview**

We are a leading provider of HR solutions in key European staffing markets, offering complementary HR
staffing solutions and services through three segments and a well-developed portfolio of specialized
business units across various geographies. We also offer digital recruiting through dedicated platforms. Our
engineering and consulting segment is focused on supplying clients with highly skilled white-collar and
mid- to highly skilled construction professionals to meet clients’ specialized needs in a variety of
end-markets including financial, industrial and construction end-markets. Our specialized staffing segment
typically supplies a small number of high demand mid-skilled blue-collar and white-collar workers (sourced
increasingly from outside our primary markets) to clients for specialized positions. Finally, our general
staffing segment focuses on a wide range of end-markets in Germany by typically providing clients with
lower-skilled blue collar workers, and to a lesser extent white-collar workers, in certain categories of
employment that are experiencing significant labor shortages.

Each of our segments is comprised of business units that have leading positions in their respective markets
and their own brand(s) which are used to market their specialized HR solutions. Our engineering and
consulting segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu, Vialegis, Redmore and Gritt (formerly TEC
Alliance) business units, as well as ibb and AERO, which are sub-business units of TimePartner. This
segment has the broadest geographic footprint, though its operations are concentrated in France, Belgium
and the Netherlands. Our specialized staffing segment is comprised of our Accent and Covebo business
units, with their primary operations in Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively, as well as branches in
countries that form part of their international recruiting networks. Our general staffing segment is
comprised of our TimePartner and Zaquensis business units which provide staffing solutions in Germany.
Our engineering and consulting, specialized staffing and generalized staffing segments represented 55.1%,
36.0% and 8.8%, respectively, of our Group’s EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup
eliminations) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Since our founding, the Group has expanded from a presence in only Belgium to 10 countries in Europe.
We have increased our revenue from approximately A127 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 to
A1.76 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. As at September 30, 2020 we had 596 branches, 3,023
in-house full-time equivalent employees and 45,824 job candidates at work. We believe our particular focus
on concentrating our services in geographic markets with attractive staffing fundamentals, supplying
specialized and niche staffing, focusing on SME clients, serving a diversified range of clients and
end-markets, implementing a strong entrepreneurial drive and remuneration system and following a
disciplined approach to strategic acquisitions have contributed to our growth.

Our industry benefits from a number of long-term underlying trends, such as ageing populations, increased
competition for talent, technological changes, re-skilling and lifelong learning among workers, workers’
increased premium on quality of life, and regulatory trends that have supported sector growth and are
projected to continue driving growth of the sector over the medium term.

The Covid-19 crisis has severely impacted the economy across all our key markets in 2020 with real GDP
growth expected to be down by 5 to 10% at the end of 2020 according to the IMF. The lockdown measures
have led to a significant reduction in staffing activities across our key markets, with clients delaying or
cancelling their needs for temp workers.

Following the lifting of the restrictions and supported by the programs sponsored by the governments, the
economy is now expected to rebound in all our key markets with real GDP expected to grow by 4% to 6%
for 2021 (IMF outlook from October 2020). With regard to the staffing market in general, recovery has
already started across our key markets and, according to Staffing Industry Analysts, the staffing market is
expected to rebound in 2021 across our key markets, albeit not uniformly.

1


-----

The market value of our Addressable Market for our existing HR solutions in the primary geographies and
end-markets in which we currently operate was estimated at A35 billion in 2017, comprising A12 billion for
the engineering and consulting market, A8 billion for the specialized staffing markets and A15 billion for
the general staffing market. Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, the market value of our Addressable Market was
expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6% from 2017 through 2023. We believe that such
growth is to be expected in the future, although with a delay due to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis,
driven by the long term underlying trends mentioned above, and that we are poised to continue growing at
or above the industry average growth rate in the future.

**Our Strengths**

We believe we benefit from the following key strengths:

**_We operate exclusively in attractive markets that are well positioned for rebound and future growth._**

The staffing industry benefits from a number of long-term underlying trends that have supported our
industry’s historical and projected medium term growth. In addition to benefiting from the attractive
long-term trends underlying the staffing market, we have strategically chosen geographic markets that
provide strong fundamentals in order to take full advantage of favorable trends. With this double
advantage, together with the success of our business model, we have been able to grow at a higher rate
than our peers and to rebound quickly from 2020’s Covid-19 induced lockdowns.

Demand for the types of solutions we provide is expected to continue growing in the future due to a
number of positive secular trends, including:

- Ageing populations in our target markets

- Technological changes affecting job candidates’ search for employment opportunities

- Younger workers’ prioritization of career mobility

- The need for workers to re-skill to adapt to changing work opportunities

- Companies’ desire to address issues relating to diversity, inclusion and corporate social responsibility

- Workers’ increased premium on quality of life

- Financial pressures resulting in increased outsourcing and offshoring.

For a detailed discussion of these and other trends affecting our industry and end-markets, see ‘‘Industry
_and Market Overview’’._

We have also sought out geographic markets in Europe where macroeconomic and other factors are
particularly attractive for companies providing HR solutions. The countries in which we are principally
active, namely Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, each demonstrate favorable attributes in
the pre-Covid-19 environment. For example, pre-Covid-19 each benefited from a stable and growing
economy marked by relatively high staffing penetration, low unemployment and high salaries. Moreover,
European Union and national regulations applicable in our key countries tend to reinforce protection of
permanent workers, which can lead companies to favor temporary work and outsourcing, especially in
recovery periods after a trough in the cycle, to scale up their workforce. At the same time, legislation in the
countries in which we principally operate allows for multiple temporary staffing solutions.

Finally, Western Europe generally is experiencing a chronic and growing large skill supply and demand
gap, obliging companies to look beyond traditional job candidate sourcing and seek the help of staffing
solutions providers like us, with the ability to recruit job candidates with specific profiles for jobs that are
particularly difficult to fill, from abroad where needed, as we draw upon an international talent pool and
provide required training.

Due in part to the above mentioned factors, our various end-markets demonstrated organic revenue
growth of between 4 and 10 percentage points above the industry average between 2014 and 2019. Before
the Covid-19 crisis, the market value of our Addressable Market, which reflects our focus on scarcity
driven roles and specialized end-markets, was expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6%
from 2017 through 2023. This compared to expected growth of approximately 4% from 2017 through 2023
in the Total Market (as defined below), which reflected the larger staffing market.

Along with the most of the other economic sectors, the Covid-19 crisis and the two lockdown periods have
severely impacted the economy and the staffing market in general. According to the International

2


-----

Monetary Fund (IMF), as of October 2020, the 2020 real gross domestic product (real GDP) in our four
key markets is expected to go down by 8.3% in Belgium, 9.8% in France, 6.0% in Germany and 5.4% in the
Netherlands. However, in all our markets of operations, governments have put in place significant
sponsored programs to support the economy, preserve jobs and prevent defaults. For further information,
please see ‘‘Industry and Market Overview.’’

Governments in each of our key markets are expecting a rebound of the economy, especially assuming the
availability of an effective vaccine in 2021. As such, in 2021, Belgium real GDP is expected to grow by
5.4%, France real GDP by 6.0%, Germany real GDP by 4.2% and the Netherlands real GDP by 4.0%,
according to IMF analyses as of October 2020. With regard to the staffing industry in general, recovery
periods after a crisis usually favor temporary work and outsourcing as companies start to scale up their
workforce while limiting the weight on their cost base. It is especially true in countries such as the markets
in which we operate, in which the permanent workers are more protected, which limits companies’
flexibility. As a consequence, the staffing market has already starting to recover. We saw recovery in our
sales from May to September 2020. In October 2020, a second round of lockdown measures was
announced, which halted the growth. The following chart of our sales for each month from January to
November 2020 as a percentage of our sales for the same month in 2019 shows the effect of the lockdowns

With regard to 2021, according to Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA—Global Staffing Industry Market
Estimates and Forecast, November 2020, https://staffingindustry.com/), the staffing market is expected to
rebound in our all key countries, albeit not uniformly. In 2021, staffing revenue is expected to increase by
5% in Belgium, 18% in France, 13% in Germany and 3% in the Netherlands.

We believe that the fundamentals of our Addressable Market remain strong in the medium-term and we
believe we are poised to continue growing at or above the industry average growth rate in the future due to
our differentiated business model and focus on our Addressable Market.

**_Our scale within a fragmented market has resulted in strong market positions in all our target markets._**

We believe that the scale of our business constitutes a significant competitive advantage within the
fragmented markets in which we operate. Our various operating companies have leading positions in their
market segments, as noted in the below selection of our indicative market positions by revenue in 2017
based on the Addressable Market (unless otherwise indicated) in which each operates.

(1) Top 3 general staffing for blue collar workers.

Many of our operating companies are reference players within their respective specialty, benefiting from
the virtuous circle of competitive leadership, with their track record enabling them to capture a high
percentage of their market growth and benefiting from brand loyalty and pricing power as a result. Clients
make staffing decisions at a local level and our large footprint with high branch density allows us to be
physically present in the communities where our clients operate, providing a key competitive advantage for
us. We believe our current position is cemented by an impressive track record in placing and training job
candidates and a top reputation within the market due to our local market knowledge, our large talent
pool and talent acquisition capabilities and thought leadership within the field.

**_We are well positioned to restart our outstanding record of both organic and external growth._**

We have grown our business over recent years both organically and through targeted, strategic and valueaccretive acquisitions.

We achieved Organic Growth of 4.5% in 2019 and 12.3% in 2018. We believe that our largely consistent
positive Organic Growth in each business segment and for the pro forma perimeter outperforms the
market and evidences the success of our differentiated business model. See the chart below to see our
revenue growth since 2007, which reflects both organic and inorganic growth.

We believe our Organic Growth is largely attributable to our ‘‘cell division’’ expansion strategy, in which we
secure new sales before committing to additional costs. As commercial activity increases over time and
reaches the point at which clear expansion opportunities are identified, we hire additional sales personnel
at the existing branch to focus on developing these opportunities out of the existing office. A new,
dedicated commercial manager is appointed and given an agreed period of time in order to acquire new
clients or a new customer segment in a prospective area. Once these new clients have been secured and
adequate revenue has been generated, the commercial manager opens a new office to handle such clients
and becomes an office manager hiring their own staff. This strategy successfully expands sales revenues
before any costs of an additional branch are incurred by providing incentives for current branch operators
to identify and develop client relationships in their area with the prospect of managing a new branch
justified by these increased sales. We see this as a key method by which we have been able to continually
strengthen our geographic breadth and depth without pursuing acquisitions and with minimal risk, driving
our organic growth. We also believe that our variable compensation model, which rewards recruiters, sales
consultants and office managers at our branches for finding, matching and retaining job candidates, is also
an important contributor to our organic growth, particularly within our engineering and consulting
segment which does not use the ‘‘cell division’’ strategy.

When we have grown through acquisitions, we have done so with a rigorous discipline. We distinguish
between low-risk transactions at lower multiples that enable growth at the local level (bolt on acquisitions),
of which we have completed 18 since 2017, and platform acquisitions, where we expand our solutions, enter
new specialties or markets, of which we have successfully completed and integrated eight since 2015. In
2019, we also took a minority stake with a step-up mechanism to acquire majority ownership and control
over the coming years in a company that has developed a recruitment robot (using an AI-enabled chatbot).

We signed two share purchase agreements on December 4, 2020, one of which relates to an addition for
Abylsen, providing consulting services in the area of well-being and homeworking to French corporates,
and the other to an addition for Continu, focusing on engineering and high skilled technical profiles mainly
for the public sector.

When we evaluate a potential acquisition target, we review the opportunity through the rubric of a number
of stringent requirements designed to ensure fit with our overall strategy and culture. First, the target must
fit an identified strategic need to expand our geographic coverage, complement a specific specialty or fill a
niche skill gap. We also seek out targets with like-minded management teams with an entrepreneurial spirit
and long term commitment in order to ensure a strong overall cultural fit. We also evaluate the target’s
profitability, historic growth and other performance metrics, and assess whether it is a leader in its
addressable markets. Once we have identified and then acquired a target, we have a well-defined and
proven integration process that involves hooking the target into our Group reporting system and sharing
best practices. Local management teams are asked to either invest at group level or continue to be invested
at local level.

Our growth is represented below using the unaudited business unit accounts of Accent as well as those of
our other business units on the basis as described in the note to the chart below.

Note: In preparing the above chart, we have included historical revenue information based on business unit accounts from various
periods, past due diligence reports and management analysis. The total includes intercompany eliminations, but excludes
TechMatch as this company was only acquired in 2020. Additionally, Gritt Projects is included, although it was divested in 2020.
Although we believe the underlying materials used and the basis of preparation to be reasonable, actual results may vary from
the indicative information presented above, in particular due to different accounting bases of preparation, and such variations
could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on the inclusion of such information. Furthermore, the growth
presented in the chart is prepared on a different basis than our Organic Growth presented elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

(1) Total revenue figures include intercompany eliminations.

(2) Intervention was formerly Accent NL.

(3) Human Capital Group is also known as TEC.

(4) Former Logi-Technic.

In 2020 we have focused on stabilizing the business, client acquisition, accounts receivable collections and
prudent cash management given the exceptional Covid-19 crisis seen globally. We believe that the business
is currently stabilizing and will gradually return to growth once the current lockdown measures have ended.
During 2020 we did not reduce our headcount materially, and we opened more branches than were closed.
Our number of branches amounted to 596 at September 30, 2020, compared to 584 branches at
December 31, 2019. As a result, our commercial team and branch network remain largely intact, with a
healthy and stable customer base (21,066 unique clients as at September 30, 2020), as a base upon which
we can confidently rebound. So far, during the Covid-19 crisis, gross margins have not materially been
impacted and customers have not renegotiated prices. Increased sickness was noticed in some areas
affected by Covid-19, but at the same time, for those businesses that allowed working from home, sickness
rates were lower compared to the same period in 2019. We will also be starting 2021 from a position of
strength in terms of our high level of people at work, with 2.3 job candidates at work per client, 239 FTE’s

Note: In preparing the above chart, we have used historical information prepared on the basis described in ‘‘Presentation of

The flexible cost structure enabled us to remain profitable despite the economic downturn in 2020.

Despite a significant decrease in sales, the decrease in our gross margin has remained limited due to our
flexible cost structure, as our costs of sales, which are mainly variable, represent over 80% of our total
costs.

Accent, Continu, Covebo, ZAQUENSIS and TimePartner mainly employ workers whose contracts can be
terminated immediately or who can be put on the bench without cost, as well as freelancers.

For workers with less flexible conditions, we were generally able to benefit from economic unemployment
measures that allowed us to decrease our costs of sales.

**_We benefit from a focus on specific end-markets and scarcity-driven job candidate profiles._**

We believe that our particular focus on specialized and niche staffing and our scarcity driven job candidate
profiles have yielded a unique model that is unmatched by any of our peers. We market our services under
brands that relate to specific specialized services offered by our business units or subunits. Our multiple
brand approach has proven effective in attracting and retaining clients. For example, our Facebook page of
Accent (55K) has in most instances almost twice the number of likes than the Facebook pages of our
competitors Randstad Belgium (21K), USG (Start) People (24K) or Adecco Belgium (35K) as at
September 2020. In addition to our unique brands, our business units are focused on particular
end-markets and job candidate profiles. We believe this deepens our knowledge of our clients’ needs and
our job candidates’ skills and qualifications, allowing us to more effectively match and place our job
candidates.

Note: The number of branches and full-time equivalent in-house employees by geography is primarily based on the location of the
operating company in which they are held, with branches and FTEs allocated to the location of such company, based on the
September 30, 2020 consolidated perimeter. Some branches or FTEs may not in all cases be located in the same country as
the operating company in which they are held so these figures are near approximations. Foreign recruitment branches are
also included within the branches associated with each of the geographies above. Sales by sector are based on the full
perimeter (including TechMatch and excluding Gritt Projects).

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our sales in the Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and France
represented approximately 37%, 33%, 22% and 8%, respectively, of our _Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue,_
based on the location of the operating company reporting the sales.

We also focus on end-markets that are resilient and less sensitive to economic cycles. Some of our
end-markets that have in the past proven vulnerable to market slowdowns, have in fact shown significant
resilience through this year’s Covid-19 crisis. In other sectors, we focus on niches where the nature of work
performed by job candidates is often related to less sensitive aspects of those end-markets—both in market
slowdowns and during Covid-19. A good example of this is Redmore, a provider of HR solutions to the
financial industry, which is generally considered sensitive to economic cycles. However, by focusing on high
demand, specialized job candidates for complex regulation-driven projects, the sensitivity to
macroeconomic cycles has proven to be non-existent during the Covid-19 pandemic, given that candidates
were continuing on specific (regulatory) projects in the financial institutions.

Through our business segments and brands in our core geographies, we provide HR solutions that meet
most of the top critical job shortages in those markets. Our focus on niche and specialty staffing highlights
the added value we can provide to companies looking for specific job candidate profiles which are often
difficult to find, and in our experience, clients are willing to attach a premium to such services and
conversely, it enables us to recruit and retain qualified job candidates. Even when we serve large corporate
clients, we believe our provision of specialized staffing solutions enables us to maintain pricing power as a
result of the quality and demand for our job candidates. Finally, our services are also utilized by our clients
throughout economic cycles, with temporary staffing solutions being an attractive option to clients both in
the early stages of an economic downturn as companies seek flexible solutions for staffing needs as well as
during a recovery period when the economic cycle is on its way up, allowing for maximum flexibility. In
certain instances today, some customers are now seeking to replace part of their permanent workforce by
more temporary and therefore more flexible solutions, allowing for maximum adaptability to their sales
potential. We believe post Covid-19, this trend will further increase.

**_We target smaller companies with local decision-making power._**

We believe that our client focus on SMEs and intermediate sized enterprises has in the past and will in the
future benefit our financial performance. According to a market study commissioned by the Group, for the
year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 77% of our sales were with SMEs or intermediate sized
enterprises with approximately 32% of these being small enterprises, approximately 29% being medium
enterprises and approximately 17% being intermediate sized enterprises.

We target SMEs and intermediate sized enterprises with local decision-making power. This means that we
generally do not participate in large tenders for the provision of a larger number of job candidates, nor do
we deal and negotiate with central procurement teams or HR departments. We believe that SMEs and
intermediate sized enterprises form a particularly attractive client base for a number of reasons. First, they
tend to be highly reliant on each employee and have lower workforce anticipation capabilities than large
corporates, meaning that when they need to hire someone, they need someone fairly quickly and place a
premium on the ability to source job candidates to meet their time constraints. Second, such clients often
have a faster decision-making process compared to large corporates and lack purchasing departments, so
we may face less pricing pressure from such companies. Additionally, they more often than not have
neither the resources nor the knowledge to dedicate to HR and therefore are willing to outsource many of
their staffing-related needs and expertise to providers like us who can provide a full service offering at all
stages of the recruitment lifecycle. SMEs often have limited employer branding and therefore may
experience difficulty in reaching the best job candidates without access to the talent pool of a staffing
solutions provider like us. Finally, we believe that the ability to find a very specific candidate with the right
cultural fit is very important for SMEs, since they typically have small teams and often seek a particular
candidate who is not only qualified for the job, but also matches the client’s corporate culture. The ability
to match such job candidates benefits from our blend of human and digital touchpoints, with regular
interaction with clients and job candidates throughout the recruitment lifecycle (including our
international recruiting capabilities). HR staffing solutions also operate in a complex regulatory
environment, for which specific knowledge by sector, geography and even region is required. The ability to
provide answers to this complexity on a larger scale increases the barriers to entry for the sector and
diminishes the risk for digital disruption or disintermediation.

We are able to meet SMEs’ needs through our deep end-market knowledge, reactivity and proximity to our
clients by providing both a full suite of end-to-end service and a large pool of resources for these clients.
We believe that our unique positioning largely protects us from competition in the areas in which we
operate, providing several barriers to entry. Our geographical footprint, branch density and our ability to
recruit internationally would be quite challenging to replicate and are essential to fostering the client
relationships and granular geographic reach necessary to reach our targeted SME clients. Furthermore, we
maintain and have access to a large database of job candidates to enable short matching times and have
acquired in-depth end-market experience through selective organic and external growth over many years,
which facilitates our ability to source, match and retain job candidates and clients. Strict quantitative and
qualitative KPI monitoring on inflow and matching further drive our operational excellence. These factors
have fueled our strong track record of successful employment relationships and our top tier reputation
within our end-markets.

Our strategy of targeting SMEs as our primary client base also increases the resilience of our operations
when presented with an economic downturn, as SMEs are less likely to lay off workers in a downturn and
fare better at maintaining their level of employment than larger companies. In addition, the chart below
shows that SMEs continued to grow their size during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and reduced their
number of employees far less, and in some cases even increased their number of employees, compared to
larger companies, whose number of employees declined during that time:

The ongoing Covid-19 crisis has had a major impact on the global economy, including SMEs’ activities,
especially as a result of severe lockdown policies that have been put in place. However, during the ongoing
Covid-19 crisis, governments in all our key countries of operation have been particularly focused on
providing needed support to SMEs. During this extraordinary period, we have been focused on continuing
to provide vital staffing services to our highly diversified customer base in specialized markets, and markets
which require a special expertise.

Despite the Covid-19 crisis, we are making continued efforts to expand our highly diversified client base
further. For example, Covebo held a ‘golden shoe’ competition to attract more new customers and at
Abylsen, the action ‘Do it day championship’ was launched to reach new customers. The business focus at
Accent has been on reaching new customers and opening new opportunities. For example, during the first
lockdown, Accent targeted fruit and vegetable farmers that were unable to use foreign seasonal workers
given the lockdown measures. Accent also launched the initiative ShareJobs, to ask companies to match
companies that had temporarily unemployed staff with other business that had significant shortages
(e.g. farmers, food retailers).

Additionally, by focusing on SMEs and intermediate sized enterprises and by monitoring the credit of our
customers diligently, we significantly reduce our client credit risk exposure. We served 19,992 unique
clients for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Our top client represented only 1.5% of our
revenue and our top ten clients represented only 8.2% of our revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020. Most of our customers receive only a small number of staff from us at any point in
time, and our services can generally be withdrawn quickly if a customer is unable to pay. In the specialized
staffing segment, customers are typically invoiced on a weekly basis, with payment terms ranging from zero
days up to 60 days, with a majority of customers on 30-day payment terms. Customers with no credit
history and very small customers get 0-day or 7-day payment terms, allowing us to monitor their payment
behavior very closely and to stop rendering services (i.e. people at work) if due dates for payment are not
adhered to. In the engineering and consulting segment, our customers are on average somewhat larger
SMEs and larger companies. In this segment, we typically invoice customers on a monthly basis, with
payment terms between 30 days and 60 days, or up to 90 days in France. Enhanced credit monitoring and
diligent accounts receivable collection during the Covid-19 crisis have allowed us to keep Days Sales
Outstanding, or DSO, stable at 52 days as of September 30, 2020, compared to 51 days as of September 30,
2019. We have credit insurance to protect our accounts receivable in place with a maximum liability
amount of up to A150 million.

**_We are at the forefront of digital innovations._**

See ‘‘—Our Service Offering—Three Staffing Segments and Digital—Digital Initiatives’’

The different steps of the value chain of our activities include a complex mix of tasks that have the
potential for high automation (such as job sourcing and job candidate matching) and those that need to be
more tailor-made for clients and job candidates and therefore require a human touch (such as interacting
with clients to know precisely what their staffing needs are and negotiation of HR contracts). We believe
we are a thought leader and ahead of our larger peers in many respects, by having already begun seizing
digital opportunities in order to both address new markets with innovative business models and improve
our own operations.

We recognize the importance of the digital marketplace to both businesses and job candidates, and we
have developed a comprehensive digital marketing strategy. For example, to draw potential job candidates
and clients to our websites, our marketing team uses search engine optimization to make our services easily
findable for all. All websites and vacancies posted have been adapted to the arrival of GoogleforJobs. We
also have an active social media presence, outpacing smaller competitors and opening new markets.
Finally, to complement our physical network of branches and reach new markets, we have pioneered
several successful disruptor technologies, including our SWOP application, which was upgraded in 2020
and allows job seekers to match with job listings, and has enabled the placement of an average of 69
contracts a month. The recent upgrade to the SWOP application allows a more complete vacancy offer and
therefore attract more candidates.

Our NOWJOBS platform is primarily geared to students and other seekers of one-off temporary jobs and
had more than 280,000 job candidates and more than 6,000 active companies participating in 2019. In June
2019 we launched our MyAccent app, allowing potential job candidates to interact via the Google Home
assistant with Accent’s list of open positions. We also launched our GIGHOUSE app focused on a digital
solution for freelancers/independent job candidates. We aim to leverage our experience as a disruptor in
the market to expand successful initiatives to our broader Group. Book’u is our planning tool, allowing
customers to plan both their permanent and temporary workforce in one solution, being in touch with this
workforce to communicate when they should be available and allowing to spot potential staffing shortages,
immediately posting these shortages at their staffing companies of choice. Softskills testing has been
developed together with the University of Ghent, to test ‘who you are’ as a person and to test ‘what type of
company do I want to work for’. These tests will allow for better (AI) matching of jobs with persons.
Finally Continu Connect will be launched in January/February 2021, showing all available candidates in a
region for our customers. All apps are developed taking into account reusability across all House of HR
operating companies’ benefitting therefore from the economies of scale House of HR has versus local
competitors and increasing the barriers to entry for our industry.

Given the above further developments, we were ideally positioned to leverage our leading digital
capabilities over the past year in order to continue connecting employers and employees. We have
continued investing in IT in 2020 and expect to continue prioritizing the digital venue going forward.

We are also innovating in our existing processes, identifying areas within our business that could benefit
from increased automation and zero-paper processes that are both job candidate- and client-facing, as well
as internal processes such as finance, procurement and marketing and communications. We believe the
efficiencies we can realize through this digitalization will produce cost savings while allowing us to meet the
ever-increasing demands of clients and job candidates.

**_We have a highly diversified, resilient and cash-generative financial profile and a decentralized structure, allowing_**
**_for fast decision making in times of crisis._**

Our differentiated business model, specific end-market and job candidate profile focus drives our highly
diversified revenue stream reflected by:

- four stable and attractive geographic markets;

- three different segments;

- nine business units with specialized brands;

- a network of over 596 branches per September 30, 2020;

- twenty international recruitment offices;

- end-market diversity (from the manufacturing, production, logistics and industry sectors), with no
end-market representing more than 31% of revenue;

- low client concentration with 19,992 unique clients year-to-date for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, with our top client representing 1.5% of our revenue and our top ten clients
representing 8.2% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020; and

- 45,824 job candidates at work as at September 30, 2020.

In addition to the diversification of our sources of revenue, our cost structure is largely variable. For 2019,
approximately 70.5% of our total operating expenses were variable, 24.5% were semi-variable and 5.0%
were fixed costs. Our cost of services, which represented 79.0% of our total operational expenses (costs of
services and operating expenses together) for the year ended December 31, 2019, is comprised of mostly
variable costs related to our people at work (mainly payroll, social security contributions, housing, car fleet
and subcontracting costs). In many of our jurisdictions, we are able to match the duration of the
employment of our job candidates and their placement, allowing us to be flexible in the deployment of our
job candidate resources. Gritt (formerly TEC Alliance), Abylsen, Redmore, AERO and ibb (the last two
being subunits of TimePartner) hire high-skilled specialists under indefinite contracts, which have in
previous years been considered as semi-variable, given our intention to retain the job candidates for as
long as possible, except for the costs related to freelancers and subcontractors, which are variable. As a
result of the Covid-19 crisis and the government measures available, some costs of sales linked to Gritt,
Abylsen, AERO, ibb & Vialegis that were previously considered to be semi-variable could be shifted to
variable.

The assets in our company are ‘‘human capital’’ which means we have limited fixed assets or cash tied up in
inventory. This results in limited capital expenditure requirements (approximately 1.5% of revenue) and
high _Pro Forma Cash Conversion, as illustrated by the following chart, which shows our normalized_ _Pro_
_Forma free cash flow and our_ _Pro Forma Cash Conversion of 92.6%, 92.8%, 91.9%, respectively, for the_
years 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Over the years, this strong cash flow growth and high cash conversion, combined with the completion of a
capital reduction in 2019, has allowed House of HR to delever on a net debt basis. The Group’s bolt-on
acquisitions also contributed to further EBITDA growth, which accelerated the deleveraging.

Note: In preparing the above chart, we have included historical revenue information that was prepared by prior management for
the period from 2008 through the date of such acquisition. This chart includes historical revenue information for all business
units that were within our consolidation perimeter as of September 30, 2020 and thereby includes TechMatch and excludes
Gritt Projects. Although we believe the underlying materials used and the basis of preparation to be reasonable, actual results
may vary from the indicative information presented above, in particular due to different accounting bases of preparation, and
such variations could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on the inclusion of such information.
Furthermore, the growth presented in the chart is prepared on a different basis than our Organic Growth presented

Directly before the Covid-19 pandemic, we took a number of measures which resulted in cash preservation
during the pandemic. Shortly before the pandemic hit, we launched a commercial finance offering in
Germany, and took additional steps focusing on credit control. We also extended our credit insurance
program with a maximum liability amount up to A150 million. We also operated with the support of

government measures to help businesses survive the pandemic, to the maximum extent possible. See ‘‘Our
_Strengths—We target smaller companies with local decision-making power.’’ Finally we made a temporary_
draw on our revolving credit facility, but repaid the draw when it was clear that this was not necessary.
Based on internal management accounts, we also maintained positive EBITDA in every individual month
of 2020 to date, throughout Covid-19.

We believe that as we continue to diversify our geographic, end-market and segment profile, particularly as
we grow our mix of services focused on engineering and consulting and specialized staffing, our revenues
will also be increasingly less driven by market fluctuations, strengthening our cash generative profile that
has a strong track record of through-the-market resilience and margin expansion.

Our resilience is further supported by the ‘‘cash protective’’ nature of our working capital dynamics. Our
working capital largely consists of receivables (client billings) and payables (job candidate wages, social
security, etc.) tied to individual job candidate placements. For each job candidate placement, the
receivable is higher than the payable with the difference roughly representing the bill-pay spread or gross
margin embedded in the client service agreements and job candidate agreements. This means that (all else
being equal) when we place less job candidates, our working capital declines, resulting in a positive cash
balance offsetting the loss of post-tax cash profit.

Working capital as a percentage of sales, per September 30, 2020, was 2.2% of sales, compared to 3.9% per
December 31, 2019 (in each case, on an LTM basis). Given that our October 2020 and November 2020
revenues were, respectively, 91.3% and 94.0% of our revenues in the same months in 2019, our working
capital requirements for 2020 have already been largely absorbed in the Group’s cash balance as of today,
resulting in no decrease of available cash. For a graphic demonstrating the trends in our monthly revenues,
please refer to the section above entitled ‘‘—Our Strengths—We operate exclusively in attractive markets that
_are well positioned for future growth.’’ The working capital dynamics and corresponding downside protection_
for our cash flows are also evident in our recent performance, which has been impacted by the Covid-19
crisis. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key
_factors affecting our results of operations—General economic conditions—Germany’’. The following chart_
shows our working capital for each month of 2020 as a percentage of sales (on an LTM basis) and
illustrates our working capital for each month in 2020 compared to the same month in 2019:

**_Entrepreneurial management team with a long term incentive culture._**

We benefit from a strong and committed management team that is highly motivated to deliver strong
performance over the long term. More than 170 managers among our management team and individual
platform managers collectively own 18.1% of our equity as of the date hereof, via tracking shares that are
linked to the performance of their business units or investments in our long-term incentive plan at our
Group level, as well as over 400 managers whose interests are aligned to the Group via our Long-Term
Incentive Plans (LTIPs).

We believe our successful organic and external growth has been due in part to the way in which we have
been able to incentivize our managers. For example, our organic ‘‘cell division’’ expansion strategy rewards
our local managers with the opportunity to create and run individual branches, fostering loyalty and

14


-----

encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit that has delivered our success to date. For our engineering and
consulting branches, our variable pay structure rewards management down to the sales and recruitment
consultants with variable pay linked to key performance indicators such as attracting, matching and
retaining job candidates and clients.

As part of the long-term incentive plan of the Group, Leaver situations may occur. Every year, one Leaver
event is foreseen based on the audited results of the year before. In this respect, a share buyback was
finalized in 2020 relating to departing management for A35.3 million, plus an accrued dividend coupon of
A2.2 million. This was completed on October 23, 2020 (with a remaining A0.8 million to be paid out in
2021).

Our variable bonus systems are intended to encourage growth and bonuses. Variable pay, consisting of
cash incentives and equity participation for our CEO and CFO, represents 50% to 60% of our CEO and
CFO’s salary package and is tied to performance targets at the Group level, such as sales revenue,
EBITDA, EBITDA growth, and equity value of the Group. Furthermore, variable pay can represent up to
50% of the salary package for other employees in our Group, including the management of our business
units, branch managers, sales consultants and recruitment consultants. See ‘‘Our Business—Employees—
_Employee compensation’’ for more information._

Furthermore, when we have grown by acquisition, we have offered an appealing value proposition to
managers of the businesses we acquire by allowing these individuals to retain autonomy over their
respective entities’ operations, including brand and identity, while allowing them to benefit from central
Group support on complex regulatory and compliance topics, access to our foreign sourcing network and
digital platforms and the possibility to leverage credit lines at the Group level. We also offer such managers
an incentive structure tied to, where possible, both their own company’s and the overall Group’s results.
Additionally, there is a long term incentive plan at our Group level. We believe that this streamlines the
integration process and helps to align the management of our acquisition targets with our central
management. We also believe that our long term incentive plan allows for succession planning for key roles
by incentivizing key staff to remain with our Group and by enabling potential reinvestments in the equity of
the Issuer going forward.

Finally, our decentralized model, with nine business units, has proven to be extremely efficient when
managing during a crisis. Each operating company has the perfect knowledge of their own (end) market,
local measures to be benefited from, behavior of its own population and employees, reaction of local
competitors and was therefore able to act accordingly and proportionally to the economic situation of their
own geography. Weekly video calls were conducted to update each other on the effects of the pandemic,
government measures, ideas to boost sales and keep motivation of employees high, and enabled quick
adoption of best practices throughout the group and across operating companies. We benefited from each
other’s creativity, which included initiatives like providing a Covid-19 bonus as well as targets and speed
bonuses.

**_Conclusion_**

We believe we are unique among our peers as a result of our strengths outlined above and that this is
reflected in our performance ahead of certain of our competitors. Based on information available, we
believe that organic growth was 2% to 7% and EBITDA margin was 5% to 12% on average per annum
from 2014 to 2017 among competitors in our Total Market. During this same period, our organic growth
and EBITDA margin typically performed above the Total Market average. For an illustration of our
Organic Growth and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA performance against our competitors, a comparison of
our Organic Growth to the normalized revenue and EBITDA performance of companies including
Randstad, Adecco and Manpower for the periods indicated is presented below.

**Our Strategies**

Our aim is to become the number one European provider of specialized human resources solutions to
SMEs. We intend to achieve this through pursuing the following strategies:

**_Make use of agile decentralized operating model to spur quick recovery and further focus on organic growth by_**
**_grasping additional market share while maintaining best-in-class profitability_**

Our decentralized model has demonstrated that it enables a quick reaction during times where fast and
tailor made decision making is needed in the different geographies and end-markets were are located in.
Both in terms of temporary closing offices, reopening offices with reduced staffing, making sure all
required materials and processes were in place (e.g. hand gels, screens, disinfecting alcohols, necessary
cleaning, grocery shopping for foreign workers, quarantine measures, and local testing). All operating
entities also tailored sales and prospection targets, enabling a very fast rebound post lockdown situations.
This has resulted in a fast recovery of revenue numbers. With the second lockdown still ongoing, it is clear
that again now, the different operating entities were able to take the right measures fit to the current
situation, resulting in a much milder decrease in revenue. Once lockdown measures are over and vaccines
are wide spread, we believe that we are well positioned to restart our track record of organic growth
through our branch development model and through continuing to target growth markets. Over the years
pre-Covid-19, we have been highly successful in achieving incremental organic revenue growth under our
‘‘cell division’’ approach, particularly in our specialized staffing and general staffing segments, where our
branch network is key, and through our ability to attract and retain job candidates for assignments in
sectors where candidates are scarce. We intend to continue to benefit from this through expanding our
branch network where needed and continuing to leverage our success in sourcing and retaining job
candidates, and focusing on those job profiles which are and will be increasingly scarce in the market. In
most of our markets we expect to continue our strategy of embedding ourselves in local communities
through an extensive branch network, which places us in proximity to our primary stakeholders: our clients,
our job candidates and our own employees. We also believe our extensive branch network approach leads
to enhanced entrepreneurship and ownership due to the managerial responsibilities and opportunities
allocated or available to branch managers, reinforcing a key part of our values. We further aim to deliver
continued improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin through a shift in our services mix (including
through increasing the relative weight of the specialized staffing and engineering and consulting services
we provide in our overall mix), as well as continued efficient cost control over operating expense and
strong cash conversion with rigorous management of capital expenditures and working capital.


16


-----

**_Focus on profitable specialized and niche end-markets._**

Over time, we expect to gradually shift our focus toward the engineering and consulting and specialized
staffing model from general staffing, leveraging our growing network in the transition to deliver higher
margins. The specialized staffing and engineering and consulting segments tend to deliver higher margins
than general staffing due to the premium clients place on successful placement of the specific job
candidates that they seek, and we intend to leverage our positive track record in these segments to
continue growing profitably. Moreover, specialization aims to target those segments and skills that are
more difficult to find for our customers, which in the past has provided more stability to our revenue
figures, including during economic downturns.

**_Enhance our reputation as the partner of choice for SMEs and locally managed clients._**

We intend to continue providing critical end-to-end temporary recruiting and outsourcing services that are
tailored to the needs of SMEs and other locally managed clients. We believe that in the future these clients
will continue to require the assistance of providers like us as they grapple with limited resources, lower
visibility on staffing needs and greater need for outsourced HR functions, including as a result of the
complexity of labor law and associated regulations. We aim to be a one-stop shop for such clients that can
help at all stages of the recruiting process to relieve our clients’ management from the burden of having to
seek appropriate job candidates for available positions. In doing so, we plan on leveraging the large pool of
potential job candidates at our disposal, the deep end-market knowledge we have gathered over the years
through having boots on the ground in proximity to our clients.

**_Ensure the smooth and profitable placement of job candidates with a reliable sourcing and reskilling platform._**

Mastering the ‘‘human’’ aspect of human resources is key to success in our industry and we intend to
continue to be a leader through our focus being able to source the right job candidate for the right
position, including through offering reskilling services. We believe that our network of international
sourcing of job candidates is vital to our success, as we are better able to bridge the large gap between the
demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates, especially as the labor market in
our addressable markets has tightened over the past few years, through having access to a wider pool of
quality job candidates than our peers. The location of our agencies (particularly in Poland, Romania,
Spain, the Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal) and the support we offer to foreign job candidates
(including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance) ensures
that we are able to tap into workforces that are skilled but that are eager to seek out opportunities to earn
higher wages than those that similar work would provide in their home countries. We intend to continue to
develop our network in other countries that meet these criteria. We also plan to continue leveraging our
large sourcing network to target the best job candidates and provide them with a wide array of positions
and support, including training, administrative support, client knowledge and even transport and housing
for foreign job candidates, in order to make their experience as smooth as possible. Finally, we plan to
focus on preparing job candidates for what we see as the jobs of tomorrow, such as white-collar positions in
big data and information technology, that are being driven by the digitalization of the economy or provide
trainings in order to teach blue-collar job candidates how to use digital tools.

**_Utilize digital initiatives to reduce cost and drive revenue diversification._**

Our digital strategy is focused on maximizing the impact of digital cost reduction initiatives, outpacing
smaller competitors who have more limited investment capabilities and opening new market segments.

In the short run, we want to leverage digital tools to complement our physical networks to attract job
candidates and clients while also spreading awareness of our brands and services. We also intend to
continue digitalizing our processes to drive efficiency.

Over the longer term, we intend to pursue a four-pillared digital strategy. First, we aim to reposition the
offices we have in urban areas into ‘‘JobShops’’ that are easy to reach, convenient, one-stop shops where
job candidates can be tested, get certifications and be matched with potential positions. We also are
continuing to develop niche, specialized platforms that are tailored to meet the specific demands of the
various markets we address. Further, we intend to utilize the data that we have generated through our
large network to deliver the best possible client and job candidate service. Finally, we plan to develop more
automated processes to free up our recruiting consultants’ time for them to focus on growing ever closer to
our client and job candidate base. In this respect throughout 2019/2020 both Continu and Covebo moved
to the Connexys software. In Gritt, better measurement tools and KPI reporting systems were introduced,

-----

to further automate and improve recruitment and placement statistics. In Accent, mobile forms are fully
digitized and OCR is introduced, capturing data from physical documents such as passports and driver’s
licenses, immediately in the candidate or customer files.

**_Target accretive acquisition opportunities to achieve European leadership._**

While our primary focus is to grow our earnings base organically and to improve both profitability and
Normalized _Pro Forma Free Cash Flow generation through our existing network and customer base, we_
will continue to consider accretive and strategic platform and bolt-on acquisitions in both new and existing
markets to achieve our goal of European leadership. We do not consider acquisition opportunities aimed
at turning around a business but only will consider opportunities that can reinforce our market positions or
expand our footprint, either in new geographical regions or niche areas in which we currently are not
present and that show the following attributes: stable economies with low unemployment, high salaries,
high temporary staff penetration and supply and demand mismatch for skilled labor. We will also consider
opportunities in digital tools that can improve the value chain or allow us to better serve job candidates as
well as clients and to develop new and complementary segments that are also marked by labor market
scarcity or that can demonstrate the prospect for high growth and superior margins. We will continue to
use our M&A assessment criteria, which requires that any opportunity meets our own high quality
standards, holds a leading position in its respective specialized end-market, reflects a strong financial
profile and represents a good cultural fit with us. For the years to come and with the financing obtained,
the focus of acquisitions will be on highly specialized businesses, business focusing on bottleneck jobs and
engineering and consulting services. While we historically have focused on bolt-on acquisitions that can
enhance our network and/or provide us with exposure to complementary sectors of the economy, such as
the additions for ‘Stevin’ and ‘Riviera’ for which we recently signed share purchase agreements, we also
occasionally consider larger acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our investment criteria.We are
also targeting certain new end-markets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals and new geographic
markets such as the Nordic countries.

**Recent Developments**

**_Acquisitions_**

On December 4, 2020, we signed a share purchase agreement relating to a company advising and
consulting companies in France on subjects pertaining to employee wellbeing and homeworking
(‘‘Riviera’’), and related areas. This business will be added to the Abylsen business unit.

On December 4, 2020, we signed a share purchase agreement relating to a company operating in the
Netherlands (‘‘Stevin’’), mainly focused on placing engineers in the public sector. This business will be
added to the Continu business unit.

The closing of the Stevin and Riviera acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions. The _Pro_
_Forma Adjusted Revenue and_ _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA impact for the twelve months ended_
September 30, 2020 of these two companies amounted to A19.6 million and A4.9 million respectively for
Stevin and A5.5 million and A2.4 million respectively for Riviera based on our due diligence in respect of
the targets.

**_Trading Update_**

Our _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA based on the business units’ accounts for the 10 months ended_
October 31, 2020 has decreased by 23.9% compared to the same period in 2019 following the impact of
Covid-19. In April 2020, Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue represented 68% of revenues of last year, whereas
in October 2020 and November 2020, this has increased to 91% and 94% respectively, confirming a strong
recovery.

connection with such event. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control’’._

(a) The operating profit/(loss) and depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been
adjusted to reflect the estimated impact of IFRS 16 (Leases) as if the Issuer began applying IFRS 16 (Leases) on
January 1, 2018.

We do not purport that had we adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2018, our operating profit/(loss) and
depreciation and amortization would have been the amounts shown. The effects of an actual adoption of IFRS 16
(Leases) at such earlier time may have differed from the estimates presented here. We did not restate the 2018
Consolidated Financial Statements order to give effect to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases). As a result, you are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these figures.

(b) Depreciation and amortization is mainly composed of amortization charges on property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets (including brand name and customer relationship).

(c) Relates to management services provided to Zaquensis and TEC Alliance while they were accounted for as joint
ventures and before they were integrated into the Group in the 2018 financial year.

(d) Relates to a provision in connection with the 2018 legal reorganization in anticipation of the settlement of a sharebased compensation benefit option plan from 2015. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Key factors affecting our results of operations—Cost of Services, Selling Expenses and Other_
_Expenses—Other general and administrative expenses’’._

(e) Relates to share-based payments made to the management of acquired businesses. In the year ended December 31,
2018 the amount represents a reversal of a ratchet provision for the managers of Abylsen. In the year ended
December 31, 2017 the amount represent provision for settlement payments of the ratchets to TimePartner, Covebo,
Continu and Abylsen which would become due in 2018 following the preparation for the 2018 legal reorganization.

_results of operations—Cost of Services, Selling Expenses and Other Expenses—Other general and administrative expenses’’._

(f) In the last twelve months ended September 30, 2020 discontinued operations relate to the divestment of Gritt Projects
in 2020, whereby the last twelve months ended September 30, 2020 constitute out of the last nine months ended
September 30, 2020 in line with the interim financial statements and the fourth quarter of the year ended
December 31, 2019. This divestment was not yet reflected in the results of the operations for the year ended
December 31, 2019—therefore a correction is made to exclude the results of Gritt Projects from the results of the
fourth quarter of 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2019 discontinued operations relate to the divestment of Gritt
Projects. As the divestment was not yet reflected in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, the
correction is linked to the full year impact.

(g) In the last twelve months ended September 30, 2020 non-recurring items of A19.6 million mainly relate to
(i) reorganization/restructuring costs of A4.7 million, (ii) Covid-19 related costs of A2.7 million, (iii) transaction
advisory fees of A2 million, (iv) social security costs related to the granting of the stock option plan at Abylsen of
A1.5 million, (v) GIGHOUSE (start-up) of A1.1 million, (vi) costs related to the 25 year celebration of Accent for
A1.1 million, (vii) provisions related to WAB in the Netherlands (mainly transition fee) for A0.9 million,
(viii) refinancing expenses of A1 million and (ix) double costs related to overlap management due to change in
management of A0.5 million . In the year ended December 31, 2019 non-recurring items of A32.5 million mainly relate
to (i) refinancing expenses of A7.8 million, (ii) reorganization/restructuring costs of A3.8 million and (iii) double costs
related to overlap management due to change in management of A3.0 million, (iv) the impairment of the works in
progress of Gritt Projects for A2.9 million, (v) costs related to the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Facilities for A2.9 million, (vi) merger and acquisitions expenses of A2.5 million, (vii) transaction advisory fees of
A2.0 million, (viii) social security costs related to the granting of the stock option plan at Abylsen of A1.5 million,
(ix) provisions related to WAB in the Netherlands (mainly transition fee) for A0.9 million and (x) expenses related to
the IFRS conversion for A0.7 million. In the year ended December 31, 2018 non-recurring items of A22.3 million
mainly relate to (i) refinancing and reorganization expenses of A6.6 million, (ii) transaction costs of A3.3 million in
connection with potential exit or divestment of certain shareholders, (iii) management exit costs of A3.0 million,
(iv) acquisitions costs of A2.0 million, (v) one-off tax compensation for management of A1.5 million, (vi) VAT
adjustments relating to the Issuer of A1.2 million, and (vii) advisors fees in connection with the conversion of our
financial statements from Belgian GAAP to IFRS of A1.1 million. In the year ended December 31, 2017 non-recurring
items of A7.7 million mainly relate to (i) a tax claim of A5.1 million, (ii) refinancing expenses of A2.8 million,
(iii) acquisition costs of A1.2 million and (iv) the reversal of non-recurring income in Accent of A1.2 million in
connection with social security reductions in prior periods.

(h) Represents adjustments made when consolidating the financial statements of our subsidiaries, which are prepared
under local GAAP, into the Issuer’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared under IFRS. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, these adjustments consisted
mainly of the provision for the share based payment plan, the capitalisation of the refinancing expenses and the
earn-out adjustment.

(i) In the last twelve months ended September 30, 2020 the amount relates to Happy Recruiter and Book’u, (companies
in which we are minority shareholders) which were not yet reflected in management accounts. In the year ended
December 31, 2018 the amount relates to a change in the consolidation scope for Zaquensis since they were fully
integrated into the Group in June 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the amount relates to the integration of
TEC Alliance and Zaquensis, in January 1, 2018 and June 20, 2018 respectively. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Acquisitions, disposals and the Comparability of our_
_Consolidated Financial Statements’’._

(j) In the last twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the amount represents the impact of three businesses that were
acquired between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020 (Eurojob, ETA and Techmatch), as well as one business
that was divested in that same time period (Gritt Projects) as if they had all been acquired (or divested in the case of

businesses that was acquired between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 (Eurojob, ETA, Mykelson and
Pharmacos) as if they had been acquired on January 1, 2019. In the last nine months ended September 30, 2020, the
amounts represent one business that was acquired between January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (Techmatch) as
well as one business that was divested in that same time period (Gritt Projects) as if they had all been acquired (or
divested in the case of Gritt Projects) on January 1, 2020. In the last nine months ended September 30, 2019, the
amounts represent two businesses that was acquired between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019 (Mykelson and
Pharmacos) as if they had all been acquired on January 1, 2029. In the year ended December 31, 2018 the amount
represents the impact of the nine businesses that were acquired between April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, as if
they had all been acquired on January 1, 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2017 the amount represents the impact

(k) Represents the impact of Stevin (A4.9 million) and Riviera (A2.4 million) for which we signed a share purchase
agreement on December 4, 2020, as if they had been acquired on October 1, 2019. The closing of these acquisitions
are subject to customary conditions precedent. The EBITDA impact in the last twelve months ended September 30,
2020 of Stevin and Riviera are based on the last estimate for the financial year ending December 31, 2020 along with
adjustments that were diligenced by us as part of the acquisition process.

EBITDA and _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be_
considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance
derived in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this Offering Memorandum may
differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and may differ from ‘‘Consolidated
EBITDA’’ contained in the sections ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ of this Offering Memorandum and in the Indenture. We present
EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the results we
would have achieved had each of the acquisitions or other transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates
indicated. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as nonrecurring will not recur in the future or that

similar items will not be incurred in the future. We present EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they
are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. EBITDA and _Pro Forma_
Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of
our operating results as reported under IFRS. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information’’.

(3) As adjusted senior secured net debt reflects the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes offered hereby and lease obligations under IFRS 16 (Leases) and IAS 17 less
cash and cash equivalents, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Offering as if it had occurred on September 30, 2020.

(4) As adjusted total net debt reflects the aggregate principal amount of total financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents as
adjusted to give _pro forma effect to the Offering as if it had occurred on September 30, 2020._

(5) Lease obligations under IFRS 16 (Leases) and IAS 17.

(6) As adjusted interest expense represents our interest expense as adjusted to give effect to the Offering as if it had occurred on

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors in the Notes should carefully_
_consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum before_
_making a decision to invest in the Notes. Any of the following risks, individually or together, could have a_
_material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects, and accordingly_
_the value of the Notes or on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. This_
_section describes the risks and uncertainties that we believe are material, but these risks and uncertainties may_
_not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those of which we are currently_
_unaware or those which we deem immaterial, may also result in decreased sales, assets and cash inflows,_
_increased expenses, liabilities or cash outflows or other events that could result in a decline in the value of the_
_Notes, or which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations_
_and prospects and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. The order in_
_which the risks are presented does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude of_
_their potential impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects or on the trading_
_price of the Notes._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, including the resulting global economic uncertainty and measures taken in_**
**_response to the pandemic, in particular its effects in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France where we have_**
**_material operations, or other epidemics or pandemics, have had a significant impact and could continue to have a_**
**_significant adverse impact on demand for our staffing services, our revenue, operations and workforce._**

A novel strain of coronavirus causing Covid-19 disease, identified in China in late 2019, has spread
throughout the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization confirmed that its spread and
severity had escalated to the point of pandemic. The outbreak of Covid-19 has resulted in authorities,
including those in the Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, implementing numerous measures
to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, lockdowns, quarantines and shutdowns of
business and workplaces, and has led to materially increased volatility in financial markets and significant
worsening of the global, European, Belgian, Dutch, German and French macroeconomic outlooks. The
extent and scope of such restrictions is highly uncertain and subject to change and stricter measures may be
put in place in the future.

The spread of Covid-19 has led us to modify certain of our operational practices, and we may take further
actions required by authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our in-house employees,
job candidates and other stakeholders. We have implemented a work-from-home policy that has been used
by most of our in-house employees. For the Group’s in-house employees who cannot work remotely, we
have implemented additional protective procedures, including equipping employees with sanitizing
equipment (e.g. disinfectants and hand sanitizers), implementing social distancing, staggering employees
working hours as required to comply with governmental restrictions, and increasing the frequency of
cleaning in the Group’s facilities, but these measures may not prevent the exposure of our in-house
employees to Covid-19. For job candidates on assignment with a client, many of the markets in which we
operate still place certain responsibilities on us for overseeing certain health and safety obligations for our
job candidates. _See_ ‘‘Regulation’’. As a result, for certain job candidates who have been placed in client
workplaces where exposure to Covid-19 is possible, we may be subject to risk of liability should such
employees allege their workplaces failed to adequately mitigate the risk of exposure to Covid-19. Since we
also place job candidates and certain employees with our clients, it is also possible that one of our job
candidates or employees with Covid-19 could then infect other employees at the clients’ premises, which
could lead to sickness, shutdowns or late deliveries at a client’s business. Clients may hold us liable should
we not have taken the required precautionary measures with such job candidates or employees and it could
also cause reputational harm to us should any such events occur. In addition, in order to facilitate remote
working arrangements, some of our job candidates are accessing client workspaces from their personal
devices through cloud-based systems, which could increase cybersecurity risks to our clients for which they
may hold us liable. The intersection of public health, workplace safety, employer liability and privacy laws
is complex, and we cannot predict how regulatory or liability regimes may evolve in the future as a result of
the Covid-19 pandemic.

The degree to which the Covid-19 pandemic continues to impact demand for our staffing services, our
business, results of operations and financial position will depend on future developments, which are
uncertain and cannot be predicted. These developments may include, but are not limited to, the duration

34


-----

and spread of Covid-19, its severity, actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the
development of and rate of deployment of vaccines, the extent and effectiveness of economic stimulus and
the speed at which and to what extent normal economic and business activity can resume. A number of
measures have been taken by governments intended to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 that have caused
dramatic disruptions to our clients businesses and impacted the demands for our staffing services, in
particular in the non-food retail, hotel, restaurant and caf´e, aerospace, travel and tourism and automobile
industries. Future waves of Covid-19 may result in national or local governments taking further severe
countermeasures. For example, in the spring of 2020 different degrees of lockdowns were introduced in
each of our primary geographic markets which had an immediate impact on demand for our staffing
services. Softer lockdowns were introduced again in the autumn of 2020 which also led to a decrease in job
candidates at work after we had experienced a gradual increase in the number of job candidates at work
following the initial lockdown in the spring of 2020. Any future measures could impose similar or more
stringent restrictions or may lead to greater economic distress and reduced demand for our staffing
services, which could affect our results of operations. Potential future lockdown measures, such as shutting
down production facilities and offices or restricting free movement of transportation and distribution,
closing of restaurant and bar facilities, closing or reducing hospitality at events, amongst others, could
disrupt our client’s businesses or ours more significantly in the future than what has been experienced to
date, leading them to curtail their reliance on us. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, there have also been
a number of government measures introduced, including in our primary markets of Belgium, the
Netherlands, Germany and France, which have positively contributed to the Group’s ability to manage
cash flows during the period and manage the costs associated with our in-house employees and job
candidates, however, a number of these measures have ended or are expected to end in early 2021. For
example, we have utilized certain postponement of VAT or other tax and benefit payments and utilized
temporary unemployment measures introduced that have allowed us to retain certain in-house employees
and job candidates without bearing the full expense of their wages and salaries. As these government
measures expire, we could experience additional costs and liabilities and may also find it more difficult to
retain in-house employees and job candidates if demand for our staffing services does not increase or is
variable due to the prolonged impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, without the introduction of additional
government measures (or which there is no guarantee any will be introduced). If any of the foregoing were
to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations, financial
condition or prospects and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

**_Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions._**

Demand for our staffing services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity and economic
conditions in the countries, regions and sectors in which we operate. A global economic downturn, such as
the one resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, that impacts a country or region in which we operate may
adversely affect our staffing services in that country or region, as fewer clients may seek our job candidates
for assignments. Moreover, our revenue and results of operations are dependent on a limited number of
countries in Europe and we have material operations in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, these countries accounted for 39.5%, 31.2%, 22.3%, and 6.2%
respectively of the Group’s revenue and as a result, we are particularly exposed to risks arising from
economic conditions in these countries. For example, as the United Kingdom (‘‘U.K.’’) represents a key
export market for several of the countries in which we operate, particularly Belgium and the Netherlands,
adverse trade terms between the U.K. and the countries in which we operate following the transitional
period in connection with the U.K.’s decision to leave the EU or otherwise could have an adverse effect on
the economies of these countries, which could by extension adversely affect demand for our services or our
business. Furthermore, a downturn in the end-markets in which we target clients could have a negative
impact on the demand for our services or the prices clients are willing to pay for our services. In addition,
an economic downturn may impact us differently than it has in the past. Among our segments, general
staffing has historically been most sensitive to economic fluctuations, which has led to decreases in demand
for such services in connection with economic downturns, including that experienced in connection with
the Covid-19 pandemic.

Actions that we take to decrease our expenses during an economic downturn may not prevent a loss in
operating profit and could have a longer term impact on our operations. When demand drops or remains
low, we attempt to reduce the amount of our sales and marketing expenses and job candidates in order to
reduce our cost of services and operating expenses but such reductions may not occur as quickly as, or be
sufficient to offset the decrease in our revenue. If periods of decline are prolonged and result in a

35


-----

significant decrease in the size of our in-house employees or job candidates, we may not be able to reduce
our expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our business units, branches and
brands. Furthermore, our decentralized structure, can lead to increased costs, which in times of economic
downturn could lead to decreased profitability.

Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_The employment services sector is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully in our markets._**

Our industry is highly competitive. This is driven by a variety of factors, including low barriers to entry
especially in localized markets, the availability of qualified job candidates, the quality and speed of
customer service, and brand loyalty. We must compete in a number of our markets not only with large,
consolidated international staffing services providers but also with smaller, more localized companies.

Furthermore, many of our competitors are global full-service and specialized employment services
providers with substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain
markets. For example, our Accent business unit which operates in the specialized staffing segment in
Belgium, faces competition from global service providers, each of which compete mainly on volume-driven
clients. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients.

We may also face increased competition from smaller, more localized staffing solutions providers as well.
Such firms would most likely cater to a smaller set of clients and as a result, may be able to provide more
time and attention to their clients. In particular, SME and ISEs may prefer to work with more localized
firms. Further, there is a risk that we may be unable to compete effectively on price with such firms as their
cost base may be lower, including regarding technological capabilities.

In addition, new and existing competitors may be aided by technology that enables them to compete with
our staffing services. The widespread adoption of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate
screening tools could make many traditional functions of staffing companies obsolete. Specifically, the
increased use of the internet may continue to attract technology-oriented companies to the staffing
industry. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook and online job boards such as
Google for Jobs are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the
assistance of a staffing company. We believe that our future success will depend largely upon our ability to
anticipate and keep pace with these and other technological and digital developments and advances.
Current or future competitors could develop alternative capabilities and technologies that are more
effective, efficient, easier to use or more economical than our services. In addition, with continuing
development and increased availability of information technology, the end-markets in which we compete
may attract new competitors. If our capabilities and technologies do not keep up with advances, become
obsolete or uncompetitive, this may lead to increased costs or not being able to find and match the right
job candidates for clients, which may lead to loss of revenues and market share.

Further, we may face competition from our clients themselves as they insource or make alternative
arrangements for some of the services we provide. SMEs and ISEs accounted for approximately 77% of
our sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 and have continued to account for a substantial portion of
our sales in subsequent periods. As such clients grow, they may increasingly take advantage of low-cost
alternatives, including developing and using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third
party to support them in their staffing needs. Moreover our clients, particularly our large corporate clients,
may increasingly look for off-shore or near-shore labor markets as alternative sources for staffing as
opposed to our staffing services, and such trend could accelerate as a result of the increase in remote
working as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, there is a risk that we may not be able to
maintain our existing client engagements and if we are not able to maintain or replace such clients, this
could negatively impact our business. Due to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our
services, loss of market share, and loss of clients. Our inability to compete effectively with current or future
competitors as a result of any of the foregoing and other factors could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified job candidates and in-house_**
**_employees._**

Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified job candidates who possess the skills
and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients, particularly for our engineering and
consulting and specialized staffing segments. In certain markets, including Germany, we may experience a
tight labor market with historically low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable
to meet our clients’ requirements in identifying an adequate number of job candidates. We must
continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified job candidates to keep pace with changing
client needs and emerging technologies. Competition for individuals with proven specialty skills is often
intense, and we expect demand for such individuals could make it difficult to retain such job candidates.
Qualified job candidates may not be available to us in sufficient numbers or on terms of employment
acceptable to us. In addition, we may lose existing job candidates to clients, if such clients decide to
permanently retain our job candidates sent on temporary assignment, including as a result of legislative or
regulatory reform. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into
their organizations job candidates from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations,
geographical regions and skill sets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response
to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify job candidates with
the required attributes, including as a result of expanding restrictions on immigration or that our training
programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills to meet the demand where needed.
We may also face difficulties in recruiting job candidates through our international recruitment network if
such job candidates are not incentivized to relocate and seek assignments with clients in the markets in
which we operate as a result of increasing wages in their home countries. Since the outbreak of Covid-19,
attracting job candidates through our international recruitment network has proven to be more
challenging, given international travel restrictions, additional quarantine measures, social distancing
measures and other government measures designed to control the spread of Covid-19. Government
measures, including the additional quarantine measures, contributed in part to a decrease in productivity
levels of job candidates (who may be required to quarantine or self isolate rather than be on assignment)
and have contributed to increased housing expenses, given quarantine and isolation requirement, as well as
providing help to job candidates with obtaining groceries that have just arrived from abroad. Depending on
how long such measures are in place, the Group could continue to experience challenges and increased
expenses in connection with its international recruitment of job candidates.

Further, we are also dependent on our in-house employees to establish and maintain client relationships,
to recruit job candidates, to run our day-to-day operations and to identify internal growth and external
acquisition opportunities. A number of our business units rely on in-house employees who are specialists in
the end-markets of the clients we serve with a deep understanding of the job requirements of our clients.
Such qualified in-house employees may not continue to be available to us in sufficient numbers or on terms
or in geographic locations which are economically and strategically advantageous to us. Moreover, we may
be unable to continue to find, develop or retain suitable in-house employees who meet our performance
standards.

If we fail to recruit, train or retain qualified job candidates who meet the needs of our clients or in-house
employees who meet our performance standards, our reputation, business and financial results could be
materially adversely affected. Similarly, increases in compensation or in benefits resulting from
competition for such qualified job candidates or in-house employees may have a material adverse effect on
our current business, future prospects, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability
to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Our results of operations or ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace_**
**_with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions, including that of_**
**_our digital platform._**

We believe our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the development
and implementation of our services and solutions. For example, rapid changes in the use of artificial
intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve, and could have
significant and unforeseen consequences for the staffing industry and for our business. There is a risk that
these, or other developments, could result in significant disruption to our business model, and that we will
be unprepared to compete effectively.

37


-----

Additionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant
on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll and client data analytics. There is a
risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the
right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace.
Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to invest in or develop particular technologies
to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business, and there is a risk that they will be
unsuccessful or not implemented effectively. Furthermore, we operate on a best practices basis, meaning
that we implement digital initiatives more broadly among our Group once they have been tested by a
business unit, which may lead to delayed implementation of, and as a result, delayed benefit from, such
initiatives. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on the appeal of our services and solutions,
or our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace and, as a result, on our
business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under
the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We rely on certain key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note_**
**_Guarantees._**

We depend on our senior management at the Group level, as well as key personnel at each operating
company, for the implementation of our business strategy and day-to-day operations. Our senior
management’s and key personnel’s knowledge of the market, our business, our clients and our Group
represents a key strength of our business model, and we believe that our experience and human capital
serve as barriers to entry to potential competitors. Accordingly, we face risks relating to our ability to
continue to attract, retain and incentivize senior management and other key personnel in our company. If
any senior management or key personnel leave, it could take time to find appropriately qualified
individuals to replace them. If we are unable to retain key members of our senior management team in
particular and cannot hire new qualified personnel in a timely manner, this could negatively impact the
management of our business units and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

**_Maintaining and protecting our reputation and the image of our brands is important to our ability to attract and_**
**_retain clients and job candidates and any harm to our reputation and brands could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the_**
**_Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

We rely on our reputation, as well as positive recognition of the brands used by our business units, among
other factors, to attract and retain clients. We believe that maintaining, protecting and enhancing our
brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, useful and innovative services
to our clients and our ability to successfully match job candidates with our clients’ needs. If clients or job
candidates do not perceive our staffing services to be of high quality, our reputation could be harmed and
the value of our brands could diminish, thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our staffing services to
existing and prospective clients as well as job candidates. We also believe that our reputation and brands
may be harmed if we fail to maintain a consistently high level of customer service. Our reputation and
brand could also be negatively affected by the actions of clients or job candidates that are inappropriate or
illegal, regardless of whether such actions relate to services we provide to such clients or arise while a job
candidate is on assignment with a client if we are publicly associated with such actions. In addition, clients
or job candidates may become dissatisfied with our billing policies, our handling of personal data or other
aspects of our staffing services. If we fail to adequately address these or other complaints, negative
publicity about us or our services could diminish confidence in and the use of our staffing services. Our
image or reputation can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if an incident receives
considerable negative publicity or results in litigation. Some of these incidents may include:

- problematic in-house employee or job candidate behavior or disagreements or disputes with clients,
job candidates or in-house employees;

- placing job candidates who do not, or are alleged to not, have the requisite background or experience;
or

- breaches or allegations of breaches of legal and regulatory obligations.

38


-----

Other incidents that may generate negative publicity or harm our reputation or brands may arise from
events that are or may be beyond our control, such as data security breaches or fraudulent activities
associated with our records, work accidents relating to job candidates placed with our clients, litigation and
legal claims or third-party misappropriation, dilution or infringement of our intellectual property. For
example, adverse publicity relating to work place accidents, including serious injuries or fatal accidents,
could have a negative impact on our business, including loss of existing job candidates or in-house
employees, loss of clients or regulatory action. Furthermore, negative publicity relating to the temporary
staffing industry, the use of foreign workers, the housing of foreign workers or immigration/worker
mobility more generally or the staffing industry more generally, whether or not directly or indirectly
related to any specific events arising from our own operations, could harm our reputation through
association, particularly if such negative publicity references us as an operator in such industry or makes
any of our clients or job candidates reluctant to use our services as a result. For example, in the past, we
received negative publicity related to the failure of a third party to provide adequate housing arrangements
for job candidates who were recruited through our international recruitment network. Failure to address,
or appearing to fail to address, these and other issues could erode client confidence in our reputation or
the brands of our business units. Restoring our reputation may be costly and difficult to achieve. Negative
publicity or negative public opinion may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract clients or job
candidates, or increase the costs of attracting and maintaining our client and job candidate base, the loss of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and
thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We could incur liabilities or our reputation could be damaged from improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or_**
**_confidential company, employee, associate, job candidate or client data, including personal data, or from other_**
**_difficulties faced in the operation of technical infrastructure._**

In connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit certain personal data,
including personnel and payment information, about our in-house employees, clients, associates and job
candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally identifiable and sensitive. In engaging in
these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology and systems and those of third-party vendors
we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and
social media. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable or
sensitive data or other operational failures may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are
not limited to, systems failures, in-house employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized
access to or through our information systems, whether by our in-house employees, vendors or third parties,
or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations.

Computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general
hacking have become more prevalent, have occurred on out systems in the past, and could occur on our
systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts by third parties to fraudulently induce our
in-house employees or job candidates to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or
systems.

An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical failure
could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory
enforcement actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. In the
past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems, which
to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results; however, there is no
assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.

Further, we are subject to specific regulations regarding the use of personal data. Those regulations
generally impose certain requirements on the Group in respect of the collection, retention, use and
processing of such personal information. Specifically in the EU, the GDPR came into force and has
applied directly to the legislation of all EU Member States from May 25, 2018, replacing historical EU data
privacy laws, and implements more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of
personal data. Moreover, there are a large amount of so-called opening clauses, which could lead to
differences between implementations of the GDPR in European Union Member States. The
implementation of these requirements of the GDPR is a burden on the Group’s legal and compliance
functions, in particular for international data transfers as they occur in our business. The task to meet all
the GDPR requirements is relatively complex. Therefore, it is possible that we may be found to fail to meet
certain requirements of the GDPR and its implementations by the Member States. In case we are found to
infringe provisions set out in the GDPR, sanctions may be imposed. Our failure to implement the GDPR

39


-----

(including the implementing rules of the EU Member States) could affect our reputation and relationships
with our clients, or result in regulatory action against us for the infringement of data protection rules, any
of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position or results of
operations. The GDPR imposes administrative fines for data protection compliance violations of up to a
maximum of A20 million or 4% of the company’s global annual turnover.

If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws or contractual obligations, or suffer a security
breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and
this could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we seek to ensure that
procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the relevant data protection regulations by our in-house
employees and job candidates and any third-party service providers, and also implement security measures
to help prevent cyber theft, we nonetheless are exposed to the risk that this data could be wrongfully
appropriated, lost, disclosed, stolen or processed in breach of data protection legislation. Managing these
risks have become more difficult in connection with working from home policies adopted by the Group in
connection with the Covid-19 pandemic and exposes the Group to additional risk for which additional
work, licenses and expertise is needed to detect and prevent the occurrences from happening. Ransomware
and cyber risks have increased in general during the Covid-19 pandemic and have also required the Group
to invest in even more strict back-up procedures, leading to higher operating costs for all of its information
technologies. In addition, concerns regarding our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or
security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in negative publicity and
have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and thus on our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Any significant disruption in our information technology systems, computer systems or software or in the systems_**
**_operated by third parties that we utilize for such services could damage our reputation and result in a loss of clients_**
**_or job candidates._**

Our brand, reputation and ability to support our in-house employees, attract and retain clients and job
candidates depends upon the reliable performance of our or our third-party suppliers’ servers, network,
cloud infrastructure, physical infrastructure, network infrastructure and content delivery processes (‘‘IT
**systems’’). Like many businesses, the Group and its third-party suppliers have experienced in the past, and**
may experience in the future, system disruptions that impact our IT systems. Any disruptions, outages or
delays in the IT systems used by the Group, including as a result of security breaches, fire, flood, power
loss, telecommunications failure, physical or electronic break-ins, earthquakes, pandemics, acts of war or
terrorism or other events or disruptions, could affect the availability of our services and prevent or inhibit
the ability of our in-house employees, clients or job candidates to access and utilize our systems or services.
The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our IT systems or could cause
them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate
for losses that may occur. An IT system failure at one site could result in reduced functionality and
productivity for our in-house employees, clients or job candidates, and a total failure of our IT systems
could cause our IT systems to be inaccessible by some or all of our in-house employees, clients or job
candidates. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our IT systems could
harm our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and
financial condition and thus our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve_**
**_our objectives._**

An important element of our strategies is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing and
employment services through the utilization of digital initiatives and the introduction of new end-markets
through acquisitions. The development of such solutions is often unique and presents costs, risks and
complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be unprofitable if we are not able to
accurately anticipate these costs and risks in implementing these solutions. For example, we may fail to
structure and utilize our solutions in a manner that properly compensates us for the IT development costs
associated with such innovations.

With respect to acquisitions, we regularly review and pursue opportunities for strategic growth through
acquisitions, including as a way to expand to new geographical areas. We may face difficulties in identifying
suitable target businesses or consummating a transaction on terms that are favorable to the Group. In
addition, we may be unable to realize expected strategic benefits, growth, diversification of our
end-markets or other financial benefits from such acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all. In

40


-----

addition, we may be unable to identify, negotiate or finance future acquisitions or other strategic
initiatives, successfully or at favorable terms. Any future joint ventures or acquisitions of businesses,
technologies, services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which
may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. For instance, in respect of the share purchase
agreements entered into with respect to Stevin and Riviera, the consummation is subject to due diligence,
negotiations, as well as the satisfaction of certain conditions and the performance of closing actions. The
parties to the agreements will not consummate the transactions until the conditions are fulfilled, which
could take several months and, in exceptional circumstances, significantly longer. Accordingly, the parties
may not be able to complete the transactions in a timely fashion or at all.

Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot
guarantee the successful implementation of our business strategies. Additionally, our strategies may put
operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our
existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially
expected, we may be unable to recover our investment or this may otherwise have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We have included certain historical financial information on entities that we acquired, which were not prepared by_**
**_us or reviewed by our auditors and in some instances, which were not audited at all, or which were prepared on a_**
**_different basis from our current IFRS financial statements, which may not be reflective of our past performance or_**
**_representative of our future results._**

Within this Offering Memorandum, we have presented certain historical financial metrics of our business
unit accounts’ revenues and EBITDA, including figures on a historical and pro forma basis from 2007 to
2019 in part to demonstrate the impact of the 2009 financial crisis on our historical results of operations
and to adjust for the impact of acquisitions we have done in the past as well as certain non-recurring and
extraordinary items. The _pro forma historical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum have been_
computed by adding the revenues of all of our acquired entities to our historical statutory accounts
(prepared from 2007 to 2015 on a Belgian GAAP basis), to present the total revenues of the Group, as if it
had been operating as a consolidated group at the relevant date (See ‘‘Our Business—Our Strengths—‘‘We
_are well positioned to restart our outstanding record of both organic and external growth.’’ and_ ‘‘We have a
_highly diversified, resilient and cash-generative financial profile and a decentralized structure, allowing for fast_
_decision making in times of crisis.’’ and_ ‘‘Conclusion’’). The historical financial metrics for the acquired
entities have been obtained from their individual accounts and are therefore not comparable to our
historical financial information. Some of these accounts may not been prepared in accordance with
statutory requirements or the accounting policies used by these acquired entities may differ in substantial
respects from the manner in which we have prepared our accounts. This financial information may not
reflect what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Group operated as a
consolidated group or reporting segment during the periods presented. A number of estimates, judgments
and assumptions were made for the purpose of allocating those items that were not directly attributable
and/or separately identifiable. We have also included certain financial figures of certain of our competitors
in this Offering Memorandum. The historical financial information of our historical statutory accounts, our
business units’ accounts and the financial reporting of certain of our competitors, have been presented for
illustrative purposes and those of our competitors are not necessarily comparable and are not prepared on
the same basis. Furthermore, our historical financial information does not necessarily indicate what our
results of operations, had they existed with our current consolidation perimeter, would have been had we
been a consolidated entity in the past, how our financial condition will be in the future or how our
operations might respond in the future to events similar to those experienced by us in the past.

**_We may not realize the expected benefit of our past or future acquisitions or we may face unforeseen costs or_**
**_liabilities._**

In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and significant platform
acquisitions, and we intend to continue this combination in the future. Recent acquisitions during the
periods presented in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements include several bolt-on acquisitions in
2019 and 2018 and the acquisitions of new business units at the Group, including Vialegis and Redmore in
2017 and TimePartner in 2016. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Acquisitions, disposals and the Comparability of our Consolidated Financial_
_Statements’’. On December 4, 2020 we have signed share purchase agreements to acquire two additional_

41


-----

companies, referred to herein as Stevin and Riviera, the consummation of which is subject to customary
closing conditions.

Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected
benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. These risks include, but are
not limited to:

- diversion of management’s time and attention from daily operations to the integration of newly
acquired operations;

- the possibility of not being able to retain key staff members and clients from the companies we
acquire;

- difficulties in conforming the acquired company’s accounting, books and records, internal controls,
and procedures and policies to ours;

- retaining the loyalty and business of the clients of acquired businesses;

- challenges arising from a lack of familiarity with new markets with differing commercial and social
norms and customs which may adversely impact our strategic goals or require us to adapt our business
model for and other regulatory frameworks;

- compliance with foreign legal and regulatory systems;

- difficulties integrating technologies and maintaining uniform standards;

- unforeseen legal, regulatory, anti-trust, pension liabilities, other contractual matters or other issues;

- difficulties in maintaining timeliness and quality of service; and

- unanticipated costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities.

Furthermore, we have in the past and expect in the future to operate and acquire businesses in countries
where the Group is not currently present, with different regulatory systems and different operating
cultures, which may exacerbate the risks identified above. In addition, acquisitions are also subject to the
risk of overvaluation of the target and thus to the payment of consideration greater than the targets’ actual
value to our business. In addition, we may be unable to evaluate the scale of a potential acquisition, which
may result in being unable to allocate proper resources to execute the acquisition, while our acquisition
model expects we may acquire new business units which will have a great deal of autonomy. Moreover,
even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses, we may not be able to
realize the potential cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements that were anticipated from the
acquisition, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we expect. Additionally, the costs of
achieving these benefits may be higher than, and the timing may differ from, what we expect.

Our failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies of past or future acquisitions could result in the
lack of implementation and achievement of our growth strategy may prevent us from obtaining the
advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under
the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We rely on search engine optimization, undertake digital advertising campaigns and utilize social media and other_**
**_online platforms to acquire new job candidates and clients, which may not be successful or cost-effective._**

We rely on Internet search engines, such as Google, to direct traffic to our business units’ websites,
including our business units’ mobile websites. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that
determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic
placement of links to our websites may be negatively affected. Moreover, a search or meta-search engine
could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing a website to place
lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that
negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of our websites, or if competitive dynamics
impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization, search engine marketing or other trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner, it may lead to the loss of existing job candidates or clients
or hamper our ability to attract new job candidates or clients. In addition, certain meta-search companies
have added or intend to add various forms of functionality to their sites. To the extent such functionality is
promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings, this may reduce the amount of traffic to our websites.

42


-----

Furthermore, we also attract job candidates as well as new clients through paid marketing channels. In
order to maintain our current revenues and grow our business, we need to continually optimize advertising
campaigns, and paid search engine optimization aimed at acquiring new job candidates and clients. Social
media and online job boards have been an effective way for us to reach passive job seeker candidates and
our success in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to promote our staffing services on
third-party websites, such as Facebook, Google for Jobs and Indeed.com to whom we pay fees to advertise.
If one of the advertisers or social media platforms to which we direct online advertising expenditures, use
to promote our services or locate potential clients, were to increase their fees, change their interface or
experience disruptions in service, we may be required to incur additional advertising expenses to acquire
job candidates and clients. Furthermore, if any significant third-party websites or platforms on which we
advertise, promote our services or locate potential clients were to lose their market position or otherwise
fall out of favor with consumers or other factors cause their user bases to stop growing or shrink, we may
need to identify alternative channels for advertising and promoting our staffing services, which could
consume substantial resources and may not be effective, or available at all. Any of the foregoing may have
a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or result of operations and thus our ability
to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Given that engineering and consulting and general staffing job candidates are typically employees on indefinite term_**
**_contracts, an underutilization of such job candidates or any significant increase in staff costs or other direct costs_**
**_may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our_**
**_ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

Our business units in the engineering and consulting segment typically places medium to highly skilled job
candidates who are engineers, technicians or other white collar consultants with clients on a medium-term
to long-term basis. The job candidates in most of our engineering and consulting business units are
employees with indefinite term contracts on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a
client. In addition, due to regulatory requirements, job candidates in our general staffing segment in
Germany, which operate predominantly in the general staffing segment, are also our employees with
indefinite term contracts and on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. In the
above instances, generation of revenue through this segment is primarily driven by the utilization of such
job candidates (i.e. the time that can be billed to a client assignment). As a result, if such job candidates are
underutilized, we will not be generating revenue, but we will be incurring costs for these job candidates.
Accordingly, the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a client assignment, or
‘‘bench time’’, has an impact on the profitability of the Group.

The degree to which we are able to utilize and manage our job candidates is affected by a number of
factors, including:

- our ability to forecast demand for our services and to recruit, maintain and deploy job candidates in
alignment with demand, including job candidates with the right mix of skills and experience to support
client demand;

- our ability to transition job candidates from completed client engagements to new assignments and to
hire, assimilate and deploy new job candidates;

- our ability to manage retention;

- our ability to engage and motivate our job candidates and their level of productivity; and

- performance, including through seeking out new clients engagements or extending existing clients
engagements.

A number of these factors have been more difficult to manage as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with a
number of the Group’s engineering and consulting clients in particular uncertain of their staffing needs or
hesitant to renew assignments for job candidates in the midst of the ongoing interruptions and uncertainty
as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. While temporary unemployment government measures have allowed
the Group to manage certain of Group’s costs that come from underutilized job candidates, a number of
these measures are due to expire and may not be reinstated and the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic may
continue to impact demand when such measures are no longer present. Moreover, the difficult economic
conditions that are forecasted, notwithstanding any recovery projected in GDP growth for our
geographical markets, may lead to a reduction in the funding and/or willingness of customers to undertake
engineering and consulting engagements, which could in turn lead to an increase in underutilized job
candidates.

43


-----

Increased direct costs (resulting from salary inflation for existing or new job candidates or an increase in
headcount for our job candidates as part of our growth strategy or otherwise) without a corresponding
increase in revenue could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit. While it is important for us to
manage our additional client assignments or higher priced job candidate costs to maintain our gross
margin, a failure to increase pay in line with our competitors could restrict our ability to attract new job
candidates and retain existing job candidates, which could impact the quality of the services we provide to
clients and our ability to win new or to maintain existing client relationships.

If our costs increase at a higher rate than our revenue, whether due to factors that lead to less revenue
(including as a result of our job candidates being underutilized) or factors that lead to increased costs, we
may not be as competitive and profitability will be impacted. As a result, a material underutilization of our
job candidates or an increase in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Note Guarantees.

**_Our interim results fluctuate as a result of seasonality in our business._**

Our revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations in many of the end-markets in which we operate. We have
in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience fluctuations in our results of operations due
to seasonal demand in our current end-markets. Seasonality varies depending on a number of different
factors and can impact our business units and our three segments differently. The underlying end-markets
we serve are subject to various drivers that impact overall industry demand and therefore demand from our
clients for staffing. For example, the construction industry may experience inclement weather or other
causes on a worksite, which can impact demand for job candidates. As a result of the mix of services we
provide, seasonal work can also cause a peak in demand during a specific period, such as the weeks leading
up to Christmas and Easter, around harvest time in the food production sector or around holiday periods
such as the Christmas holidays and summer holidays. Historically, as a general matter, our revenue
fluctuates, with higher levels of revenue typically being received in the second half of the year just after the
summer holidays, which is then sustained for a period before decreasing again in December due to
Christmas holidays. We also present certain unaudited monthly revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
financial information in this Offering Memorandum for each of the last twelve months ended
September 30, 2020, which have been derived from management accounts, typically display more
seasonality, may be subject to adjustment at quarter-end and therefore investors should exercise caution
when placing reliance thereon.

Moreover, we also experience seasonality with regards to our working capital requirements. We generally
experience larger working capital requirements in the first half of the year due to increased holiday pay,
bonus pay and tax payments. While our working capital requirements are generally lower in the second
half of the year, our working capital requirements also experience an increase at the end of the year for
end-of year bonuses and holiday pay, particularly as certain of our businesses institute mandatory holiday
at the end of the year. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Comparability of Our Consolidated Financial Statements—Our Interim Results Fluctuate as a_
_result of Seasonality in our Business’’. Furthermore, the results of the Group during 2020 have also been_
impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has impacted the traditional seasonality patterns experienced
by the Group with respect to revenue and with respect to working capital (with a number of governments
granting postponements to certain tax or other expenses and providing grants for certain unemployment
support that temporarily decreased the Group’s working capital needs) compared to previous years. Due
to the aforementioned seasonality effects we do not expect our Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
to be reflective of the results we anticipate for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Weaknesses and deficiencies in our controls generally or over financial reporting may prevent us from managing our_**
**_growth effectively, reporting our financial results accurately or result in a material misstatement of such results._**

The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our controls. Controls over
financial reporting have inherent limitations, including human error or inaccuracies in recording
information or transferring information into systems, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or
become inadequate because of changed conditions, a lack of requisite personnel, lack of segregated duties
or controls, fraud or because of our decentralized structure across smaller business units. Because of these
inherent limitations, controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
In addition, our organizational structure may make it difficult to implement changes across business units
in a consistent manner, including those required for internal control, other controls and compliance. We

44


-----

could also face difficulties in bringing the controls, accounting procedures and policies of the companies
that we acquire up to the standard of our controls and procedures in time for the reporting cycle following
an acquisition, which could lead to inaccuracies or misstatements in our financial reporting. If we cannot
maintain or execute adequate controls over financial reporting or implement required new or improved
controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of
our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our reporting
requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business or our results of operations,
or be required to restate our financial statements. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We face risks associated with the collection of trade receivables and certain counterparty risk._**

Trade receivables constitute a significant portion of our assets and are therefore a major business
investment. As at December 31, 2019 and as at September 30, 2020, trade receivables constituted 15.5%
and 13.5%, respectively, of our total assets. Successful control of the trade receivables process demands the
development of appropriate credit, collection, and financing policies. In addition, we are exposed to credit
risk, meaning the risk that our clients and other counter-parties may be unable to fulfill their payment
obligations. Macroeconomic conditions have a significant influence on credit risk, as in an economic
downturn more clients tend to fall into default, which could be magnified for us as a result of our exposure
to SME and ISE clients, which may have less ability to raise capital from other sources during a downturn.
Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate, a number of businesses, particularly
small businesses, have been supported by government measures. It cannot be excluded that as the impact
of the Covid-19 pandemic continues or once these government measures expire, such businesses, including
our clients supported by such measures, may face cash flow shortages or bankruptcy, which could impact
our ability to collect trade receivables in a timely manner or at all, particularly for those receivables which
would not be covered by the Group’s credit insurance. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed
to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer.

We are also exposed to counterparty risk with respect, certain credit insurance maintained by certain of our
business units, swap agreements we have entered into in respect of interest payments as well as factoring
agreements (for which our Group retains a credit risk and late payments risk). Financial services
institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other
relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about the financial stability of one or
more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide
liquidity disruptions, losses and defaults. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of
a default by one or more of our counterparties. If we fail to maintain a solid collections policy or to
manage our credit risk or if there were such an economic downturn in the markets in which we operated or
an impact on the financial services markets including our counterparties, such a failure or event could have
a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to
fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We include an implied equity value range in this Offering Memorandum which is based on current market_**
**_conditions and recent related transactions. This implied equity value is an estimate and may be different, or could_**
**_change in the future, and such change could be significant._**

The implied equity range presented in this Offering Memorandum is based on current market conditions
and recent related transactions, including the multiple used for minority roll-up transactions on June 21,
2018 in connection with our 2018 legal reorganization. Such implied equity value is not an accounting
measure under IFRS and therefore should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent
measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those calculated using financial measures
that are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our estimated range of our implied equity value at the time of
the Offering is an internal assessment and not subject to the same procedures undertaken in a fair value
assessment. As a result, we can offer no assurance to investors that our implied equity range in this
Offering Memorandum is reflective of the implied equity value that would be determined if a fair value
assessment were undertaken now or in the future, and investors should not place undue reliance on the
implied equity value shared in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all the risks we face and, if we are no longer covered by our_**
**_existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms or at all._**

Our policy is to maintain occupational accident, credit, general professional liability, employers’ liability,
workers’ compensation, motor third party liability, property damage and cyber insurance and additional
insurance covering our main insurable risks to the extent such insurance coverage is available for
reasonable premiums. However, we may become subject to liability against which we have not been
insured, cannot insure or are insufficiently insured, which could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, to the extent any claims arise during a
job candidate’s assignment with a client which we expected the clients’ insurance to cover and it does not,
we may face uninsured losses in connection with any such events. In addition, we may not be able to enter
into new insurance agreements on commercially acceptable terms and conditions in the future. For
example, our business units in Belgium are required to insure occupational accidents through specifically
licensed private insurance companies, as a consequence of the Law of April 10, 1971 and subsequent Royal
Decrees. Furthermore, following the outbreak of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate, a number
of insurance companies have increased or may attempt to raise insurance prices, which we may not be able
to fully recover by passing along these increased expenses in our negotiations of client contracts and fees
for our job candidates’ services. Given the nature of our operations, which typically results in us placing
our job candidates on our payroll while they are on assignment, we are required to insure a significant
number of persons. As temporary staffing often runs at a poor loss ratio for insurers, including ours in the
recent past, this could result further in significant premium increases in the future unless we can find a
suitable alternative or unless we experience a decline in insurable events. For 2021, these increases will
lead to an additional A2.8 million cost for Accent, which cost is expected to be partially offset by increases
in fees charged to clients for our job candidates services and Group efforts to lower accident occurrence.
The materialization of any of these risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition
or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

**_Changes in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect demand for our services._**

From time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory
agencies, governments and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such
as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted by staffing services, particularly temporary staffing services.
Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of staffing arrangements as a source of flexible
labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from
organized labor, political groups, or regulatory agencies, or alternatively due to increased use of and
preference for online job platforms and other digital intermediaries which results in decreased demand for
our services from clients, we could experience a decline in revenue. In addition, the use of foreign workers
by the staffing industry is also criticized and may receive significant political, media or other attention from
time to time. To the extent that this decreases demand for our staffing requires, this could also result in a
decline in revenue for the Group. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under
the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Changes in our financial reporting standards, accounting policies and accounting adjustments, in particular the_**
**_implementation of IFRS 16, could affect our reported results and impact the comparability of our two year historical_**
**_results ending December 31, 2018 as compared to our results after IFRS 16 becomes effective, including our_**
**_historical results for the year ended December 31, 2019 and our interim results for the nine months ended_**
**_September 30, 2020._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. Our
historic consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP. The
Annual Consolidated Financial Statements are the first that we have prepared in accordance with IFRS.
We are required to adopt new or revised IFRS or International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IASB’’) as adopted
by the EU. We cannot predict what future changes will be adopted or how they will affect us. New
accounting pronouncements, as well as new interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements, can
have material adverse effects on our reported results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In
addition, we can provide no assurance that any regulatory authorities that oversee our businesses or our

46


-----

creditors judging compliance with our debt covenants will not take issue with conclusions that we may
reach with respect to accounting matters.

In relation to recent changes in accounting standards, IFRS 16 (leases) was published on January 13, 2016
and became effective beginning on January 1, 2019. It has resulted in almost all leases being recognized on
the balance sheet by lessees, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the
new standard, an asset (the right to use asset) and a financial liability, measured as the net present value of
future lease payments, are recognized. Our main leased items consist of company cars, regional
headquarters, branches and parking places as well as housing accommodation for some of our temporary
job candidates. We also lease printing and information technology (‘‘IT’’) equipment which are classified as
low value assets and thus exempt. As a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, a total right-of-use asset of
A75.4 million was recognized on the balance sheet (including the finance leases classified as a finance lease
under IAS 17) as of December 31, 2019. We applied the simplified transition approach and therefore did
not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and ‘‘Consolidated Financial Information—_
_Note 2.2—Changes in accounting policies and disclosures’’. These and further changes in financial_
accounting standards or policies which we are required to adopt may have a material effect on the
presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.

**_We may have to incur significant charges for impairment of goodwill or other material intangible or tangible_**
**_non-current and current assets._**

As at September 30, 2020, goodwill represented A861.5 million or 54.3% of our total assets. Our
non-current assets amount to A1.2 billion and our current assets amount to A430.1 million. As required by
IFRS, we test material assets annually for impairment. As our business units have been growing, we have
not experienced any material impairments of goodwill during the three years ended December 31, 2019.
However, the moment we have any indicator that the value of any of our material assets could decline,
including indicators such as an economic downturn, the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic or
certain business decisions, this results in an impairment test that could result in impairments of goodwill or
of other current or non-current assets, and if any such impairments were substantial, this would negatively
impact our operating profit. Any significant charge for impairment in the future could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition or result of operations and thus our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Risks relating to template contracts and forms may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note_**
**_Guarantees._**

We maintain contractual relationships with a large number of clients across the jurisdictions in which our
business units operate. In order to efficiently manage these contractual relationships at each of our
business units, we employ general terms and conditions and standard templates in our contracts and forms.
Further, certain of our business units work with a number of large corporate clients and are sometimes,
required to adhere to their standard terms and conditions. As a result of the foregoing, we are exposed to
legal risks whenever such contracts contain drafting errors, execution errors (including unsigned
agreements), lack sufficient detail on the nature of our liability to the client, require customized terms and
conditions, or require additional analysis as to legal sufficiency. Such general terms and conditions,
standard contracts and forms used and signed by us may not comply with all the applicable legal
requirements at all times. Furthermore, as our in-house employees receive incentive-linked pay, they could
agree to non-standard terms in a bid to sign on new clients which may expose us to additional liabilities. In
addition, certain agreements with our clients contain indemnifications and hold harmless obligations in
favor of our clients. We are not always able to contractually exclude or limit such potential claims and
certain of our contracts therefore bear the risk of uncapped liability, including certain agreements with our
large corporate clients. There can be no assurance that we will not experience these problems in the future,
that the insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted against us or that we may not incur fines or
other losses if any such problems should arise. Any of the foregoing may result in claims for compensation,
unexpected liabilities for the Group or other legal consequences that may have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_A significant portion of our revenue is derived from SME and ISE clients and we could be negatively impacted by the_**
**_costs associated by providing such service or adverse market conditions or other factors that affect our SME and_**
**_ISE clients._**

Our client portfolio is mainly composed of SMEs and ISEs accounting for approximately 77% of our sales
for the year ended December 31, 2017 and have continued to account for a substantial portion of our sales
in subsequent periods. Key challenges we face in providing services to the SME and ISE market include:

- serving as the expert in staffing needs to organizations that often lack internal HR resources and
ensuring our services meet their needs in terms of support, flexible decision making and excellence in
customer service;

- devoting resources to advise our SME and ISE clients on compliance with applicable labor
regulations, including health and safety requirements;

- investing in client relationships takes time and staffing assignments with SMEs and ISEs may require
more of such investment since typical average staffing needs may be for only one to two job candidates
at a time; and

- devoting significant resources to developing services tailored to their needs, standards and specific
requirements.

Furthermore, an economic downturn in the end-markets in which our SME and ISE clients operate could
have a negative impact on the demand for our services or the prices such clients are willing to pay for our
services. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the results of operations and financial
viability of SMEs and ISEs as many have had their trading interrupted due to lockdowns and typically
businesses of such size have difficulty accessing debt and equity financing. Although certain government
programs have been established to assist SMEs and ISEs, we can provide no assurance that these schemes
will be sufficient and they may be discontinued in the future, and as a result many SMEs and ISEs may be
in danger of closing. There are a wide range of studies examining the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on
SMEs, ISEs and self employed individuals, including a survey by SME Europe, an trade association of
SMEs, which stated (as of May 2020) that only 25% of companies and self-employed individuals reported
sufficient liquid funds and sales to survive the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic unscathed, with
more than 25% reported having been forced to lay off employees or not renew employment contracts. A
further 45% of survey respondents indicated having cut new planned jobs and 68% having postponed
planned investments in infrastructure and production. Therefore, the SME and ISE sector may face
significant difficulties in recovering from the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. See
also ‘‘We face risks associated with the collection of trade receivables and certain counterparty risk.’’

As a result, our focus on SMEs and ISEs could result in additional costs to the Group as compared to our
peers that are less focused on the SME and ISE market. In addition, conditions or developments that
affect SMEs and ISEs in particular, which may be related to macroeconomic factors, regulatory
developments, consumer trends or other factors leading to a material decline in SMEs’ and ISEs’ demand
for staffing services could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition or
results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.’’

**_The structuring of our contractual relationships may prevent us from passing along increases in our operating costs_**
**_which could adversely affect our profitability._**

Our contracts with clients may provide for fixed pricing rates for the services to be provided, a cap on
pricing or other terms which we negotiate based on our assumptions regarding our clients’ required scope
of services, costs that will be incurred to fulfill the scope and operational efficiencies we expect to achieve
and other estimates. In this context, we seek to pass on our costs to our clients, but this may not be feasible
in all situations. These assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate as a result of increases in our
costs driven by changes in regulation, increased competition in the labor market, changes to economic
conditions, other costs beyond our control or other developments, and as a result, our margins under these
contracts may be materially adversely affected. In particular, we may be unable to pass on increases in costs
due to a change in regulation governing minimum wage requirements, payments required to be made
under social security and other benefits which could affect our profitability. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, wages and salaries and social security, in aggregate, constituted 87.7% of our cost of
services. See ‘‘We are subject to extensive laws and regulations which may adversely affect our ability to conduct
_our business and may reduce our future earnings.’’ Although we seek to structure our arrangements with_

48


-----

third parties on a back-to-back basis with the related customer arrangements—for example, by entering
into agreements with job candidates with durations and termination rights that are coterminous with the
duration of our contracts with the relevant clients, there may be instances where we are not able to offset
or transfer such costs to our clients. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and thus on our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**Risks Relating to Legal Matters and the Regulatory Environment**

**_We are subject to extensive laws and regulations which may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and_**
**_may reduce our future earnings._**

In many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Belgium and Germany, the employment services
industry is heavily regulated. These laws and regulations sometimes limit the size and growth of
employment services industries in these countries. For example, Germany prohibits the use of staffing
services by staffing solutions providers in the local construction end-market. Furthermore, in April 2017,
Germany enacted legislation introducing equal pay for temporary workers as well as restricting the length
of temporary employment to 18 months, which led to a downturn in our business and an adverse impact to
our operating results due to the overtaking of temporary workers by clients, and which legislation has
continued to have an impact in subsequent periods. While we have systems and processes in place to
monitor our compliance with such laws, it is possible such systems could fail which could have a negative
impact on the Group’s financial results or reputation. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key factors affecting our results of operations’’._

In addition, substantial changes to Dutch law governing temporary staffing came into effect from
January 1, 2020. These changes to regulation had some impact on our business, as they resulted in the costs
for temporary work increasing. For example, there are increased social security charges for temporary
staffing agencies in their capacity as employer. Furthermore, payroll employees will be entitled to all terms
and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions. As a result of these regulations coming into
effect in 2020, the Group’s cost of services have increased, but we also simultaneously increased our sales
prices for our job candidates’ services. While to date we have been able to pass on the majority of these
increases in costs to our clients through higher fees charged for our services, this nevertheless leads to an
increased cost for our services at clients, which may lead to clients questioning the relatively higher cost of
temporary/flexible staffing versus hiring permanent employees, thus reducing their demand for our
services. The impact of these changes cannot yet be ascertained, given the impact experienced during 2020;
the Covid-19 pandemic may lead to both increased demand for flexibility, but at the same time, may also
lead to additional focus on cost savings at our customers, leading to less use of temporary work.

In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our job candidates.
For example, as a consequence of certain legal restrictions, certain deductions are not allowed if the net
salary paid to job candidates falls below minimum wage as a result. For these non-deductible costs, we send
invoices to the workers. If workers do not pay their invoices and return to their country of origin, we are
left with the costs. Furthermore, changes in zoning regulations or their interpretation could result in
increased costs in order to house our job candidates. Covid-19 related government measures relating to
quarantine regulations and separate housing requirements for job candidates at certain of the Group’s
business units have also resulted in increased housing costs for job candidates. Additionally, trade unions
may use the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and
expenses associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing workforce solutions. How employmentrelated laws are interpreted and applied to our practices may result in increased operating costs and less
flexibility in our business. Furthermore, many countries are also expanding restrictions on immigration and
have introduced substantial penalties that may be imposed on staffing solutions providers and their client
for employing foreign workers without necessary work and residence permits. As a result, there is a risk
that we may incur greater expense in connection with restrictions imposed on recruiting foreign workers.

In addition, the countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things:

- create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we
currently provide;

- require that new or additional benefits be paid to our job candidates;

- increase payroll related costs such as general and medical insurance, workers’ compensation;

49


-----

- require us to comply with additional social laws, including in relation to collective bargaining
procedures;

- require us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services;

- limit the circumstances under which temporary staff may be employed;

- reclassify the status or categorization of our job candidates under applicable social laws which would
require us to comply with additional requirements, including payment of additional welfare benefits;
or

- increase taxes such as sales or value-added taxes.

In some countries, we are able to utilize laws, regulations or governmental measures that incentivise work
and employment through governmental support programs, subsidies or other specific measures which help
generate demand for our staffing services and provide opportunities for us to place job candidates or to be
reimbursed for certain of their wages or salary costs by placing them in work. These governmental
programs include those supporting shift work, night work, students and training, amongst others. If these
programs are discontinued, there may be less demand for our staffing services. In addition, should we or
the administrator responsible for such programs determine as a result of reviews, control procedures or
otherwise that any of our job candidates or the work opportunity do not meet the eligibility criteria for
such programs after we have placed them, we may not be eligible for any subsidies for such job candidates’
wages or salaries or we could be required to reimburse the government for any subsidies that were already
received, which could have a negative impact on our profits. Furthermore, the Group has also benefitted
from temporary government measures introduced as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which are not
expected to last, and may result in increased costs for the Group following the expiry of these measures.
See ‘‘The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, including the resulting global economic uncertainty and measures taken
_in response to the pandemic, in particular its effects in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France where_
_we have material operations, or other epidemics or pandemics, have had a significant impact and could_
_continue to have a significant adverse impact on demand for our staffing services, our revenue, operations and_
_workforce’’ for additional information._

Any future regulations or interpretations from administrations thereof may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operations because they may make it more difficult or
expensive for us to continue to provide employment services (e.g. by increasing employment taxes),
particularly if we cannot pass on increases in costs to our clients. This could, in turn, impact our ability to
fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Our staffing business is required to maintain and comply with a number of permits, licenses or certifications, and_**
**_our failure to maintain or comply with such authorizations may result in the loss of our licenses, our existing clients_**
**_or may hamper our ability to attract new clients._**

In some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including Belgium and Germany, our temporary staffing
business requires a variety of permits and licenses. Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable
to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable regulations or requirements
occur. In the event of non-compliance, our existing permits and licenses may be revoked or we may be
subject to a fine, and re-application for such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require the
Group to incur significant cost and expense. Certain of our licenses are also subject to periodic renewal. If
the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically
prevented, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

We also maintain various client quality certifications which authorize certain of our business units, such as
Abylsen and Redmore, to supply services to our clients. A failure to renew these quality certifications in
future audits may cause us to lose existing clients and threaten our ability to attract new clients, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus
on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Breaches of the health and safety laws may adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Our clients operate in a variety of end-markets in which our clients and our business units are often subject
to a number of increasingly stringent health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, our job candidates

50


-----

working in these end-markets, including, in particular the construction, infrastructure and defense sectors,
may be subject to accidents at work, some of which have in the past and could in the future, result in
injuries, including severe ones causing disability or even death. In certain of the jurisdictions in which we
operate, we may be liable to our job candidates for damages or subject to regulatory action as a result of
unsafe working conditions at the client’s premises. We could also be liable toward our job candidates or
subject to regulatory action or loss of our license to the extent we do not meet legal requirements with
respect to such placement, for example submitting job candidates to a medical examination for applicable
placements in advance of the job candidate beginning work. For a description of the regulatory regime
affecting our business, see ‘‘Regulation’’. Furthermore, any failures of such standards by our clients or
ourselves that generate adverse publicity could have a negative impact on our reputation and our ability to
attract future business, result in the loss of existing job candidates affected by any such behavior or
otherwise harm our business or operations. In circumstances where a liability arises as a result of the
actions of a client, we may be unable to recuperate or bring a claim in respect of any sums that we have
paid in connection with the relevant claim. As a result, any failure to comply with the existing, or any
future, protection standards by our clients may also result in civil claims, regulatory action and penalties
against us as well. Any failure to prevent a health or safety risk from occurring and causing damage or loss
may materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and
thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Legal, regulatory or other adversarial action, including employment-related claims, could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business._**

At any given time, we may be a party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising in the
ordinary course of business. These may include possible claims by clients or regulatory bodies against us
relating to:

- classification of temporary workers;

- employment of undocumented workers;

- failing to verify job candidates’ backgrounds and qualifications;

- job candidates’ misconduct or negligence; or

- fraudulent or criminal job candidate activities or misuse of client proprietary information.

We may also be subject to claims by job candidates or regulatory bodies (including in relation to actions of
our clients or any third parties that we hire). Some of these may include claims relating to:

- violations of labor laws such as minimum wage requirements:

- discrimination and harassment;

- wrongful termination or denial of employment;

- violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;

- violation of social laws, such as provision of adequate housing for foreign workers; or

- payment of workers’ compensation claims or other health and safety related claims.

In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we bring claims or may be pursuing other legal or
regulatory remedies. We are involved in contractual relationships with our clients and other third parties
that may cause us from time to time, by court order or by unilateral action, to enforce our contractual
rights against these parties. These claims may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged losses,
civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief. If any such claim is ultimately resolved unfavorably, and
we are required to bear all or a portion of the costs arising from such proceedings, we may not receive
compensation we were expecting, be required to incur additional expenses may be less effective at
enforcing our agreements in the future.

Although we are not currently subject to any material litigation and do not expect any liability arising from
any of the existing legal proceedings to have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity,
capital resources or financial position, we may be subject to such litigation in the future. In addition, we
may be subject to other disputes, claims and complaints, including adversarial actions, by clients, in-house
employees, suppliers, insurers and others in the ordinary course of business.

51


-----

Significant claims or a substantial number of small claims may be expensive to defend, may divert the time
and focus of management away from our operations and may result in our having to pay monetary
damages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In
addition, adverse legal publicity or substantial litigation against us could negatively impact our reputation,
even if we are not found liable, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Note Guarantees.

**_Our business may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our_**
**_business depends or if we are subject to claims of intellectual property infringement._**

Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our
proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property, including the value of our brands. We rely upon
a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements and patent,
copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely on certain license
agreements from third parties to utilize software or other intellectual property used within our businesses.
For example, certain of our business units rely on proprietary software that we have developed internally
or acquired, such as our MyTools application or mobile apps developed as part of digital initiatives
strategy. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing
services and solutions similar to ours or from using similar software to ours. Further, the steps we take may
not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by
competitors, former in-house employees or other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property
rights of third parties. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement,
misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld.

Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, may
be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets or proprietary technology or
for us to defend against claimed infringement or misappropriation of the rights of others and to determine
the scope and validity of our or others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights. We may not prevail in
any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be subject to monetary liability and injunctive or
equitable relief, which may prevent our use of others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights if we are
not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Any failure by us to protect our
trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes
and the Note Guarantees.

**_Changes in the interpretation of tax laws, changes to tax rates or the introduction of new tax legislation may have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill_**
**_our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

We are subject to income and other taxes in the jurisdictions where we have operations. The tax bases and
rates of these respective tax jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic and political
conditions. Revisions to tax legislation or to its interpretation (whether with prospective or retrospective
effect) may also affect our results, and significant judgment is required in determining our provision for
income taxes. Furthermore, political, media or other attention may result in increased examination of our
tax structures by tax or other authorities. Our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in earnings in
countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes
in the respective tax laws. Our other taxes are impacted by changes in local tax laws or to changes in our
business.

In addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our
provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include transfer
pricing and reporting relating to intercompany transactions. We are routinely subject to tax examinations
by the tax authorities and in the past have been required to pay adjustments as a result of the findings of
such examinations, including for additional social security payments for job candidates. In such audits, our
interpretation of tax legislation may be challenged and tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree

52


-----

with, and subsequently challenge, the amount of profits taxed in such jurisdictions. In certain of our
jurisdictions, we may also be subject to criminal penalties if the tax authorities find us to be in
contravention of the applicable legislation. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate
outcome of any such audits and related litigation could be different from any of our provisions for taxes
and may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness**

**_The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies that have no revenue generating operations of their_**
**_own and will depend on cash from the operating companies of our Group to be able to make payments on the Notes_**
**_and their Note Guarantees._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies and conduct no business operations of
their own, and have no significant assets other than cash pooling, bank accounts and shares of their
subsidiaries, if any. The Issuer and such Guarantors are dependent on the cash flow from our operating
subsidiaries in the form of dividend distributions and interest payments under intercompany loans to meet
their obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may be
restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness or by law, in their ability to make such
dividend distributions or fulfill their obligations under intercompany loans to enable the Issuer or such
Guarantors to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes and their Note
Guarantees. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and
contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.

While the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement limit the
ability of our subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other
intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and
exceptions. We cannot assure you that arrangements with our subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the
agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries and our results of operations
and cash flow generally will provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or payments under
intercompany loans to fund payments on the Notes or such Note Guarantees. In the event that we do not
receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required
principal and interest payments on the Notes or such Note Guarantees. We do not expect to have any
other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.

**_Our substantial indebtedness and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the_**
**_Note Guarantees._**

We currently have, and after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant amount of
outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of September 30, 2020, on an unaudited as
adjusted basis to give effect to the Offering, we would have had A1,199.5 million of outstanding total
indebtedness, including A200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes offered hereby,
A370.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and A550.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement. See ‘‘Capitalization’’. In addition,
our Revolving Credit Facility (which we do not expect to be drawn (other than the rolling over of the
Existing Ancillary Facility (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) which was increased by
A1.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement on July 20, 2020) and do not expect
to draw the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date) provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of
A100.0 million, subject to certain conditions. We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to exist for
the foreseeable future and the covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture provide
us with significant flexibility to incur additional debt and make distributions. Our significant leverage could
have important consequences for our business and operations and for holders of the Notes, including, but
not limited to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debts
and liabilities, including the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities;

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our
debt, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, organic
growth projects and for other general corporate purposes;

53


-----

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a downturn in our business
or general economic or industry conditions;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater
financial resources than we have;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and
industry;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, and
limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, joint ventures, working capital,
capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating
rate of interest; and

- limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future
and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the
Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt will depend on our future operating
performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is
subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors
that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain
enough capital to service our debt or to fund our future acquisitions or other working capital expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including debt in connection
with future acquisitions. The terms of the Indenture will and the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture permit our subsidiaries to incur additional debt as well, in each case,
subject to certain limitations. See ‘‘—We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it
_difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business’’. If new_
debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face could increase. For a discussion of our
cash flows and liquidity, see ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources’’._

For further information regarding our substantial leverage and for more information about our
outstanding indebtedness, see also ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including_**
**_the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Indenture will contain, and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain, restrictions on the incurrence of
additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and,
under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. Under the Indenture, in addition to specified permitted debt, we are, or
will be, able to incur additional debt (including senior secured debt) so long as, on a pro forma basis, our
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Indenture) is at least 2.00 to 1.00. In addition, in order to
incur Senior Secured Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement, our Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) may not exceed, on a pro forma basis,
3.81 to 1.00, and in order to incur Junior Secured Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture), our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) may
not exceed, on a pro forma basis, 4.75 to 1.00. Such Junior Secured Indebtedness in particular may benefit
from second-lien security interests on the collateral that secures the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Facilities Agreement without granting such security to the Notes offered hereby. The terms of the
Indenture will permit us to incur future debt that may have substantially the same covenants as, or
covenants that are more restrictive than, those of the Indenture.

54


-----

Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes (such as at
the level of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes). We may also incur debt that may be secured
on a senior basis, including indebtedness benefiting from second-ranking liens on the collateral securing
the Senior Secured Notes which would be effectively senior to the Notes offered hereby and/or
indebtedness that could mature prior to the Notes. In addition, the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute debt under those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leveragerelated risks described in this Offering Memorandum. An inability to service our debt could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and thus on our ability to
fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants which limit our operating, strategic and financial flexibility._**

The Indenture will contain, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement
contain, covenants that impose significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on
our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity or quasi equity;

- make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create unrestricted subsidiaries;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- consolidate or merge with or into other entities or carry out corporate reorganization;

- sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;
and

- make loans or otherwise extend credit to others.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants’’, ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of_
_Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities—Covenants’’. These covenants could affect our ability to operate our_
business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or regulatory developments or take
advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely
affect our ability to finance our operations, pursue acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our
organization or finance our capital needs or such acquisitions.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture_**
**_or the Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could_**
**_materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

The Indenture will and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement require us
to comply with various covenants, including a springing financial covenant in respect of the Revolving
Credit Facility requiring us to maintain a specified leverage ratio and which is tested when loans under the
Revolving Credit Facility aggregate 40% of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility on
the last day of a financial quarter. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities’’. Our ability to
meet this financial ratio could be affected by a deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events
beyond our control, including, without limitation any unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to meet this ratio. Moreover, the Senior Facilities Agreement includes
certain events of default (including, among other things, events of default for breaches of representations
and warranties, an event of default for our failure to make principal payments when due on certain other
debt and financial covenants breach) that are in addition to the events of default set forth in the Senior

55


-----

Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the agent under the Senior Facilities (if directed by the majority lenders
thereunder (or majority lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in the case of a financial covenant
default)) could amongst other things, terminate any available facilities, cancel any undrawn commitments
and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and any other sums then
payable, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may
be accelerated or become payable on demand in the event that acceleration occurs under the Senior
Facilities Agreement. In these circumstances, our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to repay in full
that debt and our other debt, including the Notes then outstanding, if some or all of these instruments
were accelerated, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay
our obligations under the Notes in such an event.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or sustain our operations, including due to factors_**
**_outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations, which may not be_**
**_successful._**

Our ability to make payments on or to refinance the Notes or our other debt obligations, and to fund
working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to
generate sufficient cash. This depends on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative,
regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed
in these ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt
obligations, and additional debt and equity and quasi equity financing may not be available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debt, including the Notes,
or to fund our liquidity needs, including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under
the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on the
January 26, 2026 the date falling, prior to the maturity date of the Notes, the Term Loan B Facility will
mature on July 26, 2026 the date falling, prior to the maturity date of the Notes and the Senior Secured
Notes will mature on the date falling July 15, 2026, prior to the maturity date of the Notes. If we do not
have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to
fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our
future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations as they
mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at
all.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition
at such time and on market conditions. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than
our current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict
our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture may restrict us
from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find alternative financing,
and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable
to us. If we are not able to refinance our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially
reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In
that event, borrowings under other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or crossacceleration provisions may become payable on demand or immediately due and payable upon
acceleration, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding debt on a timely basis
would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional debt.
In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and
might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other

56


-----

obligations. The terms of our debt, including under the Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell
assets. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain the funds that we could have
realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions
may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement, will
limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks, and such rates including changes in, or uncertainty relating to, the EURIBOR_**
**_and LIBOR calculation process may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

A substantial portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we will be exposed to the risk of
fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility,
which are based on, in respect of the Term Loan B Facility, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(‘‘EURIBOR’’) and, in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, either EURIBOR in respect of utilizations
in Euro or the London Interbank Offered Rate (‘‘LIBOR’’) for all other utilizations (in each case, subject
to a 0% per annum floor) and in each case plus an applicable margin.

The interest rates based on EURIBOR and/or LIBOR, are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ and are the
subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these
reforms are already effective whilst others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such
benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences
which cannot be predicted.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the ‘‘Benchmarks Regulation’’) applies, subject to certain transitional
provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a
benchmark within the EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things,
it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject
to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU
supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU
based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed).

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Term Loan B Facility and Revolving
Credit Facility, if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with
the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect
of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant
benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory
scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the
setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements.

Specifically, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned as a result of the absence of relevant active
underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of benchmark reforms) for
market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. The FCA has indicated through a series
of announcements that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed
after 2021. Separately, the euro risk free-rate working group for the euro area has published a set of
guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new
euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles
indicate, among other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust
fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system.

It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR and EURIBOR will
continue to be supported going forward. This may cause LIBOR and EURIBOR to perform differently
than they have done in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Such factors
may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market
participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the
rules or methodologies used in the benchmark and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark.
Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national
reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported
EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under
the Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest
expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow available for capital expenditures
and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. None of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the

57


-----

Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Indenture contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any
portion of our floating rate debt.

**Risks Relating to the Notes**

**_Your right to receive payment under the Notes and the Note Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior debt._**

The Notes and the Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

- be unsecured and general senior subordinated obligations of the Issuer and such Guarantor;

- be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt of the Issuer and such Note
Guarantor, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, Senior Facilities
Agreement and certain hedging obligations;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future pari passu indebtedness of the Issuer
and such Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and such Note
Guarantee;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or such
Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Note Guarantee;
and

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and their subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes
or the Note Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
indebtedness or obligation;

Although the Indenture contains restrictions on the ability of the Issuer and Guarantors to incur additional
debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of the Issuer or a Guarantor in respect of an insolvency
event, the holders of senior debt of the Issuer or such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the
assets of the Issuer or such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to the Notes or such
Note Guarantee. Until the senior debt of the Notes or such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to
which holders of the Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions to be included in the
Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior debt of the Issuer or such Guarantor as
their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of the Issuer or a Guarantor, holders of
senior debt of the Issuer or such Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Notes, in
respect of the Notes or the Note Guarantees.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Note Guarantees
provide:

- customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Notes for the benefit of the
holders of senior debt of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

- that if a payment default on any senior debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor has occurred and is
continuing, the Issuer or such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Notes or its
Note Guarantee until such default is cured or waived and 120 days after the date on which the
applicable payment blockage notice is received;

- that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness that permits
the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default, the
Issuer or such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Notes, or pursuant to its Note
Guarantee, until (amongst others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 90 days in
relation to a payment default or 150 days in relation to a default which is not a payment default after
the date on which the applicable notice is sent to the senior facility agent or to the senior secured
notes trustee; and

- that the holders of the Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the majority
senior secured creditors, from taking any enforcement action in relation to the Notes or such Note
guarantee, except in certain circumstances.

The Indenture also provides that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will have
standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Moreover, the

58


-----

Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture restricts the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency
proceedings or take legal actions against the Issuer and each Guarantor and by accepting any Note each
such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of
the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse under the Notes and the Note Guarantees in the event
of a default by the Issuer or a Guarantor.

As of September 30, 2020, on an as adjusted basis giving effect to the Offering, A920.0 million in priority
debt, consisting of senior debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors effectively ranking senior to the Notes,
would have been outstanding. See ‘‘Summary _Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other_
_Financial and Pro Forma Information’’ and ‘‘Capitalization’’_

**_Claims of our senior secured creditors will have priority with respect to their security over the claims of holders of_**
**_Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness._**

Claims of our senior secured creditors will have priority with respect to the assets securing their
indebtedness over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to
any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness or other
obligations. In the event that any of the senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantors of the
Notes becomes due or the creditors in respect thereof commence enforcement proceedings against
collateral that secures such indebtedness, the collateral remaining after repayment of that secured
indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the Notes. As a result, holders
of Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Guarantor.

**_The Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may_**
**_adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands and the
enforcement of each such Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed
by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such
Note Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such guarantee
exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such guarantee would be in breach of capital
maintenance or thin capitalization rules, financial assistance rules, fraudulent conveyance rules, law, rules
or regulations affecting the rights of creditors generally or any other general statutory laws and would
cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary
duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Note Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to
certain defenses available to guarantors generally and to limitations contained in the terms of the
Indenture designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant
Guarantors. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Note Guarantee could be materially reduced or
eliminated altogether, or its Note Guarantee may be unenforceable depending upon the law applicable to
it and facts and circumstances at the time of enforcement.

It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a
bankruptcy of a Guarantor may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee
on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee should
be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the Notes
would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor and/or
grantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor and/or grantor, as applicable. Future Note Guarantees
and/or security interests may be subject to similar limitations. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and
Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’.

In addition, by virtue of the subordination, standstill and turnover provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, in the event that the Note Guarantees become subject to an enforcement action, it is likely
that given the relative size of the Senior Debt (as defined under ‘‘Description of the Notes’’) compared to
the aggregate amount of the Notes outstanding as of the Issue Date and due to the limitations on the
enforceability of the Note Guarantees under applicable law, payments to Senior Debt creditors may
consume all amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees, as Senior Debt must be discharged in full
before claims under the Indenture are repaid with proceeds from enforcement. As a result of the
foregoing, the obligations of the several Guarantors under the Note Guarantees could be significantly less
than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, and/or residual proceeds from enforcement of the Notes

Guarantee at any given time may be minimal. Investors should note the general limitations and exceptions
to enforceability to the Note Guarantees imposed by applicable law discussed elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Note Guarantees will be_**
**_released automatically, without the consent of the holders of such Notes or the Trustee._**

There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Note
Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor (other than the House of Pledge) will be released:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the capital stock of
the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such Guarantor), if the
sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a restricted
subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;

(2) upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all the
assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary), if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the Indenture;

(3) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;_

(5) upon the release of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees’’;_

(6) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined in the Indenture);

(7) as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers’’;

(8) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization (as defined in the Indenture);
or

(9) with respect to an entity that is not the successor Guarantor, as a result of a transaction permitted by
‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation’’.

The Note Guarantee of the House of Finance and the House of Pledge will be released upon the
occurrence of an event described in paragraphs (4), (6), (7) and (9) above. See ‘‘Description of the Notes’’.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries and effectively_**
**_subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes._**

Certain of our subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. Our subsidiaries will not have any obligations to
pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the
Notes or grant security interests in this respect. Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade
creditors and any preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor subsidiaries, are entitled to payments of their
claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their
respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized
or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the respective Notes) will have
no right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred
stockholders will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets
of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as
applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

60


-----

As such, the Notes and each related Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors,
including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.
For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2020, our restricted subsidiaries that will guarantee the
Notes (each on an unconsolidated basis) in aggregate accounted for substantially all of our consolidated
EBITDA. As of September 30, 2020, the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Notes had
A3.9 million of borrowings outstanding. The Indenture, subject to certain limitations, will permit these
non-Guarantors to incur additional indebtedness, which may also be secured.

Any of the debt that our non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the Indenture
will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the related Note Guarantees and any debt we incur that is
secured on property or assets that do not secure the Notes will be effectively senior to the Notes to the
extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness.

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Note Guarantees may adversely affect the_**
**_validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees of the Notes._**

The Guarantors’ obligations are subject to certain restrictions to comply with laws of Belgium, Germany
and the Netherlands and the laws of the jurisdiction of any additional entity which becomes a guarantor.
Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against the Guarantors will be subject to certain
defenses available to the Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction, as the case may be.

Although laws differ in these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses may include those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, voidable preference,
insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance
or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of
these laws and defenses are applicable, the Guarantors may have no liability or decreased liability under its
Note Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations, applicable law and facts and
circumstances at the time of enforcement. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New
York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Note Guarantees against the
Guarantors.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note Guarantees,
see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations’’._

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of Belgium and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you_**
**_as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_**
**_limitations on the Guarantees, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and_**
**_enforceability._**

Our obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. The Issuer is organized under the
laws of Belgium and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Belgium, Germany, and the
Netherlands.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your
interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. See
‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations’’. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or similar event, proceedings_
could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be
complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the
enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you will be able to enforce your rights
effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of a Guarantor’s or the Issuer’s
jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States
or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of
governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the
proceedings. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over
which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to
collect payment in full under the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The rights of

holders of the Notes under the relevant Guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of a number of
jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other
similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for
creditors. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of Belgium may be
materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors’ rights, the priority of
creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. The
application of these various laws in these jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law
should apply and could adversely affect the ability to realize any recovery under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance
and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in
courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer and the
enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor. The court may also in certain circumstances avoid the
security interest or the Guarantee where the company is close to or near insolvency.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees, see
‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations’’._

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may have the_**
**_right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the_**
**_tender._**

The Indenture will and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture requires us to make an offer to purchase the
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, respectively, at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase if we experience
certain specified change of control events. The Senior Facilities Agreement also provides for a mandatory
prepayment to lenders thereunder to repay them at par if we experience certain specified change of control
events. The source of funds for any offer to purchase Notes or Senior Secured Notes, or repay lenders
under the Senior Facilities, required as a result of any such event would be available cash or cash generated
from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds
provided by our subsidiaries. Sufficient funds may not be available at the time of any such events to make
any required purchases of the Notes tendered and we may not be able to secure access to enough cash to
finance the required purchases of the Notes tendered. Our failure to effect a change of control offer when
required would constitute an event of default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a
default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement. A change of
control may result in an event of default and/or mandatory prepayment obligation under, or acceleration
of, our other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default
under our other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. In addition, certain events that
may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities may not constitute a change of control under
the Indenture. The future indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries may also contain
prohibitions on certain events that would constitute a change of control.

Further, if pursuant to a change of control offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture will
permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at a price of 101% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. As a
consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender the Notes against their will at a price
equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected.

Under the definition contained in the Indenture governing the Notes, a change of control may include a
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a
whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or
substantially all’’, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether
the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. Furthermore, certain important corporate
events that might adversely affect the value of the Notes (including certain reorganizations, restructurings
and mergers) would not constitute a ‘‘change of control’’ under the Indenture. Furthermore, the

62


-----

occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will
not be deemed to be a change of control if at the time our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than
certain specified levels. For a complete description of the events that would constitute a ‘‘change of
control’’ under the Notes, see the section entitled ‘‘Description of the Notes—Change of Control’’.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they may be_**
**_sold._**

Because the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, or will not be, and are not required to be,
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be
offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, outside the United
States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or
in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other
applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation
of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’.

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the Notes._**

The interests of our principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as
holders of Notes. Our principal shareholders have, and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the
power, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as well
as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve any other changes to our operations. For
example, our principal shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain
material assets or make dividends distributions, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The
interests of our principal shareholders could conflict with interests of holders of Notes, particularly if we
encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our principal shareholders could
also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments although such transactions
might involve risks to the holders of Notes. In addition, our principal shareholders may come to own
businesses that directly compete with our business.

**_The proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the Notes._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the ‘‘Commission’s Proposal’’) for
a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria,
Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the ‘‘Participating Member States’’). However, Estonia has since stated
that it will not participate. The last report of the General Secretariat of the Council dated December 9,
2019 has indicated that talks are still ongoing between the participating Member States.

The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in
the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within
and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes
where at least one party is a financial institution established in a Participating Member State, and at least
one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to
be, ‘‘established’’ in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by
transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument
which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU
Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own
professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**_Interest payments on the Notes may be subject to Belgian withholding tax._**

Payments of interest on the Notes made by the Issuer will be subject to Belgian withholding tax, currently
30% of the gross amount of the interest on the Notes, unless certain exemptions apply. One such
exemption provides for payments of interest by the Issuer on the Notes without deduction or withholding

63


-----

tax in the event that the Notes are held by certain Eligible Investors (as defined in the ‘‘Description of the
_Notes’’) in an exempt security account that has been opened with a financial institution that is a direct or_
indirect participant in the NBB-SSS operated by the NBB. As a result, if a holder of the Notes is not an
Eligible Investor or holds a Definitive Registered Note (as defined in the ‘‘Description of the Notes’’) that
can no longer be cleared through the NBB-SSS, such holder may be subject to Belgian withholding tax.
Additionally, in case the holder of the Notes is not an Eligible Investor such holder will be unable to avail
themselves to the withholding tax gross-up provisions under the Indenture. On the other hand, holders of a
Definitive Registered Note that can no longer be cleared through the NBB-SSS will continue to be able to
avail themselves to the withholding tax gross-up provisions under the Indenture See ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts’’_ _and ‘‘Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Belgian tax_
_considerations’’._

**_The Notes are initially held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies. The Issuer shall pay principal, premium, if any, and interest_**
**_due and payable on the Notes represented by the global notes directly, or indirectly through direct participants in the_**
**_NBB-SSS, if applicable, to the holders of such global notes, and in the event that the Paying Agent recovers any_**
**_amounts in respect of the Notes from the Issuer, the Paying Agent will not be required to segregate the amounts_**
**_received by it (if any) from the Issuer._**

The Notes are represented by one or more global notes and held through financial intermediaries
authorized to hold dematerialized securities on behalf of third parties in the records of the NBB-SSS
(including Euroclear and Clearstream). For a full list of participating central securities depositories as at
the date of this Offering Memorandum, see https://www.nbb.be/en/list-nbb-investor-icsds. Interests in the
global notes trade in book-entry form only, and the Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive
registered notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests held in Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(as a direct participant in the NBB-SSS) only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests
will not be considered owners of the Notes. NBB or its nominee will be the sole registered holder of the
global notes representing the Notes.

The Issuer shall make all payments of principal and interest due and payable on the Notes represented by
global notes via the Paying Agent directly, or indirectly through direct participants in the NBB-SSS, if
applicable, to the holders of such global notes (as shown on the record of the NBB). The Paying Agent will
not be required to segregate or hold in trust such amounts received by it (if any) from the Issuer or any
other person, including the Trustee. In the event that the Paying Agent were subject to insolvency
proceedings at any time when it held such amounts, owners of the book-entry interests would not have any
further claim against the Issuer or the Trustee in respect of such amounts, and would be required to claim
such amounts from the Paying Agent in accordance with applicable Belgian insolvency laws.

Owners of book-entry interests do not have the direct right to act upon any solicitation by the Issuer of
consents or any request by the Issuer for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including
enforcement of security for the Notes. Instead, each owner of a book-entry interest is reliant on the
NBB-SSS, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, to act on its instructions and/or is permitted to act directly only
to the extent that such owner has received appropriate proxies to do so from the NBB-SSS, or, if
applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of
such proxies will be sufficient to enable owners of book-entry interests to vote on any requested actions or
to take any other action on a timely basis. See ‘‘Book Entry; Delivery and Form’’.

None of the Issuer, the Paying Agent or any of its agents, or the Trustee or any of its agents has any
responsibility, or is liable, for the proper performance by the NBB-SSS or its participants of their
obligations under their respective rules and operating procedures. The Issuer has no responsibility or
liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, the Notes within the NBB-SSS. The
Issuer’s obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has paid the NBB-SSS or the participants in the
NBB-SSS, as applicable, and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter
transmitted through the Notes of the NBB-SSS and custodians or intermediaries.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited._**

The Notes are new issues of securities for which there is currently no established market. We cannot assure
you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell the Notes; or

64


-----

- the prices at which you would be able to sell the Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market
for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a
negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.
The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the
Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any
time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the
U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active
trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell the Notes
at a fair value, if at all.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized outside the United States, and their business is conducted
entirely outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors
are non-residents of the United States, and substantially all of their assets are located outside the United
States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts
in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indenture, you may be unable to
effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and
the Guarantors. In addition, because a majority of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their
respective subsidiaries (to the extent applicable) and all or a majority of the assets of their directors and
executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments
obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be
subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. See ‘‘Service of
_Process and Enforcement of Judgments’’._

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce
(i) judgments of U.S. courts obtained against the Issuer, the Guarantors and the directors and executive
officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S.
federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or
such persons predicated upon U.S. federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with any non-US
jurisdictions. There is therefore doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal
securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. For
further information see ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments’’.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption’’ and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives_
proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable
security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies have assigned and may in the future assign credit ratings
to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit
rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain
constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by
the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction
or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

65


-----

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment-grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes issued under
the Indenture receive an investment-grade rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s, and BBB� or better by
S&P or Fitch, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day
and continuing until such time as the Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency,
certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status’’. At any time when these_
covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash
dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the
interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an
investment-grade rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange and
admitted to trading thereon, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. Although
no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the
Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to
listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may
have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euros (‘‘reference currency’’), an investment in the Notes will entail
foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
euro relative to the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments.
These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the euro against an investor’s reference currency could cause a decrease in the effective
yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on
the Notes is translated into their reference currency. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency
other than U.S. dollars by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign
exchange gains or losses, if any. See ‘‘Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations’’._

**Overview**

We are a leading provider of HR solutions in key European staffing markets, offering complementary HR
staffing solutions and services through three segments and a well-developed portfolio of specialized
business units across various geographies. We also offer digital recruiting through dedicated platforms. Our
engineering and consulting segment is focused on supplying clients with highly skilled white-collar and
mid- to highly skilled construction professionals to meet clients’ specialized needs in a variety of
end-markets including financial, industrial and construction end-markets. Our specialized staffing segment
typically supplies a small number of high demand mid-skilled blue-collar and white-collar workers (sourced
increasingly from outside our primary markets) to clients for specialized positions. Finally, our general
staffing segment focuses on a wide range of end-markets in Germany by typically providing clients with
lower-skilled blue collar workers, and to a lesser extent white-collar workers, in certain categories of
employment that are experiencing significant labor shortages.

Each of our segments is comprised of business units that have leading positions in their respective markets
and their own brand(s) which are used to market their specialized HR solutions. Our engineering and
consulting segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu, Vialegis, Redmore and Gritt (formerly TEC
Alliance) business units, as well as ibb and AERO, which are sub-business units of TimePartner. This
segment has the broadest geographic footprint, though its operations are concentrated in France, Belgium
and the Netherlands. Our specialized staffing segment is comprised of our Accent and Covebo business
units, with their primary operations in Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively, as well as branches in
countries that form part of their international recruiting networks. Our general staffing segment is
comprised of our TimePartner and Zaquensis business units which provide staffing solutions in Germany.
Our engineering and consulting, specialized staffing and generalized staffing segments represented 55.1%,
36.0% and 8.8%, respectively, of our Group’s EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup
eliminations) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Since our founding, the Group has expanded from a presence in only Belgium to 10 countries in Europe.
We have increased our revenue from approximately A127 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 to
A1.76 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. As at September 30, 2020 we had 596 branches, 3,023
in-house full-time equivalent employees and 45,824 job candidates at work. We believe our particular focus
on concentrating our services in geographic markets with attractive staffing fundamentals, supplying
specialized and niche staffing, focusing on SME clients, serving a diversified range of clients and
end-markets, implementing a strong entrepreneurial drive and remuneration system and following a
disciplined approach to strategic acquisitions have contributed to our growth.

Our industry benefits from a number of long-term underlying trends, such as ageing populations, increased
competition for talent, technological changes, re-skilling and lifelong learning among workers, workers’

increased premium on quality of life, and regulatory trends that have supported sector growth and are
projected to continue driving growth of the sector over the medium term.

The Covid-19 crisis has severely impacted the economy across all our key markets in 2020 with real GDP
growth expected to be down by 5 to 10% at the end of 2020 according to the IMF. The lockdown measures
have led to a significant reduction in staffing activities across our key markets, with clients delaying or
cancelling their needs for temp workers.

Following the lifting of the restrictions and supported by the programs sponsored by the governments, the
economy is now expected to rebound in all our key markets with real GDP expected to grow by 4% to 6%
for 2021 (IMF outlook from October 2020). With regard to the staffing market in general, recovery has
already started across our key markets and, according to Staffing Industry Analysts, the staffing market is
expected to rebound in 2021 across our key markets, albeit not uniformly.

**Comparability of Our Consolidated Financial Statements**

**_Acquisitions, disposals and the Comparability of our Consolidated Financial Statements_**

In the past several years, our growth and expansion has accelerated through platform acquisitions, such as
those of TimePartner in 2016 and Redmore in 2017, which became new business units of our Group, as
well as bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen or complement the position of our existing and new business
units and contribute to our international recruiting network.

consolidation perimeter since January 1, 2017 and through September 30, 2020:

sciences end-markets in Belgium and France, respectively, and both operate as part of our Abylsen
business unit in the engineering and consulting segment.

The Group has made a number of non-binding bids that are outstanding as at the date of this Offering
Memorandum. These offers are in line with our strategy to further invest in niche staffing, focus on digital
and expand also in the engineering & consulting segment. The offers are in line with past acquisitions in
terms of size and profitability and would be funded from cash and the proceeds of the senior unsecured
notes.

Our acquisitions have resulted in increased revenue and increased geographical coverage, as well as
improved diversification of our services and the number of clients and end-markets that we serve. On
account of the number of acquisitions that we have undertaken and intend to continue to undertake, our
results of operations from period to period may not be comparable.

Acquisitions, which include the acquisition of majority stakes in equity investments or joint ventures that
were previously not accounted for as part of our consolidation perimeter, affect our results of operations in
a couple of ways. First, our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place are affected by
the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our consolidated results. Organic Growth accounted
for 15.2%, 12.3%, 4.5% and (14.1)% of the revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31,
2018, December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Some acquisitions, such as those
of Zaquensis and TEC Alliance, which were acquired in 2016, started as joint-ventures with our Group and
were eventually moved into our consolidation perimeter. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and
2017, we accounted for Zaquensis and TEC Alliance as joint ventures. In the year ended December 31,
2018, as a result of the buy-out of one of the main minority shareholders of TEC Alliance in January 2018
and acquiring the remaining shares of Zaquensis in June 2018, a full consolidation has been recorded for
these entities. Furthermore, in 2016 we contributed our shares in Logi-Technic to TEC, which was a jointventure at the time, moving Logi-Technic outside of our consolidation perimeter until we acquired control
over TEC Alliance in 2018 bringing both entities into our consolidation perimeter.

In addition, as acquired businesses are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, the full impact of an
acquisition is only reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the subsequent financial year.

Our cost of services, selling expenses and other general and administrative expenses have typically
increased in proportion to the size of the acquisitions we have undertaken. However, certain acquisitions
have created opportunities for margin improvements, particularly where such acquisitions have shifted the
services mix we offer from more general to more specialized, or where such acquisitions have been in our
engineering and consulting services segment, since more specialized job candidates are typically in greater
demand and can thus result in our Group having greater pricing power when placing job candidates.

Because of the number of acquisitions we have undertaken and the nature of the businesses we acquire, we
carry a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. As at September 30, 2020, goodwill
represented A861.5 million or 54.3% of our total assets. Our goodwill is measured at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment annually, or
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. If an impairment
charge were made, we may record significant charges in our income statement under IFRS. Our margin
based on current goodwill impairment tests appears to be sufficient to avoid any material impairment risk
in the near future. We have historically financed acquisitions through a combination of borrowings, equity
and excess cash generated within the Group. We structure our acquisitions to include contingent and
deferred consideration that is included in the cost of the business combination at the fair value on the date
of the acquisitions. Apart from a number of earn-outs for which the remaining price to be paid by us to
sellers is estimated to be approximately A7.9 million if conditions precedent are reached, we do not have
any material financial or legal claims under the stock purchase agreements for the acquisitions during the
period under review.

We expect to continue to pursue smaller, margin-accretive, complementary bolt-on acquisitions, mainly in
our existing markets, and we also occasionally consider larger acquisitions that are otherwise consistent
with our investment criteria. We are also targeting certain new end-markets such as healthcare and
pharmaceuticals and new geographic markets such as the Nordic countries. For further discussion
regarding our acquisitions strategy, please refer to ‘‘Our Business—Our Strategy—Target accretive
_acquisition opportunities to achieve European leadership.’’_

**_Our Interim Results Fluctuate as a result of Seasonality in our Business_**

Our revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations in many of the end-markets in which we operate. We have
in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience, fluctuations in our results of operations due
to seasonal demand in our current end-markets. Seasonality means that our results vary from quarter to

75


-----

quarter, and therefore the results of one quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year.
Seasonality varies depending on a number of different factors and can impact our business units and our
three staffing segments differently. The underlying end-markets we serve are subject to various drivers that
impact overall end-market demand and therefore demand from our clients for staffing. For example, the
construction end-market may experience inclement weather on a worksite, which can decrease demand for
our job candidates. As a result of the mix of services we provide, seasonal work can also cause peaks in
demand during a specific period, such as the weeks leading up to Christmas and Easter, around harvest
time in the food production sector or around holiday periods, such as the Christmas holidays and summer
holidays. Historically as a general matter, our revenue fluctuates, with higher levels of revenue typically
being received in the second half of the year beginning just after the summer holidays, which then lasts for
a sustained period before decreasing again in December due to Christmas holidays. Due to this seasonality
effect, we do not expect our Interim Consolidated Financial Statements to be reflective of the results we
anticipate for the full year to which they apply.

Furthermore, the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30,
2020 have been additionally impacted by Covid-19, which has impacted the traditional seasonality patterns
experienced by the Group with respect to revenue and with respect to working capital (with a number of
governments granting postponements to certain tax or other expenses and providing grants for certain
unemployment support that temporarily decreased the Group’s working capital needs) compared to
previous years, though the working capital dynamics of our business are such we are largely able to match
payables with receivables for job candidates at work at SMEs which does provide us with some countercyclicality.

Moreover, we also experience seasonality with regards to our working capital requirements. We generally
experience larger working capital requirements in the first half of the year due to increased holiday pay,
bonus pay and tax payments. While our working capital requirements are generally lower in the second
half of the year, our working capital requirements also experience an increase at the end of the year for
end-of year bonuses and holiday pay, particularly as certain of our businesses institute mandatory holiday
at the end of the year.

For additional information see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our interim
_results fluctuate as a result of seasonality in our business’’._

**_IFRS 16 has been adopted from January 1, 2019 and impacts the comparability of periods within our_**
**_Consolidated Financial Statements_**

IFRS 16 (Leases), which the IASB published in January 2016 and which became mandatory for companies
reporting in IFRS from January 1, 2019, eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases,
and requires almost all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Under this new standard, an asset
(the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability, measured as the net present value of future lease
payments, are recognized. Short-term leases and low-value leases are exempted. The new standard affects
certain commonly used financial ratios and performance metrics because of its impact on the balance sheet
and on the nature of the expenses related to leases, as rent expenses are substantially replaced with
depreciation and financial expense.

The new lease accounting rules under IFRS 16 primarily affect the accounting for our operating leases.
The Group’s main leased items are company cars, its regional headquarters, branches, and housing for
some of its temporary staff. We also lease printing and IT equipment which are classified as low-value
assets and thus exempted from the scope of this new standard.

We have applied the IFRS 16 standard from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019. Furthermore,
we have applied the simplified transition approach and therefore we have not restated comparative
amounts for the year prior to its first adoption. As a result of the application of IFRS 16, we recognized
right-of-use assets of A72.9 million (including contracts that were classified as a finance lease under IAS 17)
as at December 31, 2019. Furthermore, our operating profit for the period increased by A0.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 due to the application of IFRS 16. With respect to the consolidated
statement of cash flows, operating cash flows increased as a result of the application of IFRS 16, and
financing cash flows decreased as repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities are now
classified as cash flows from financing activities. See ‘‘Annual Consolidated Financial Statements—
_Note 2.2—Changes in accounting policies and disclosures’’ and ‘‘Interim Consolidated Financial Statements—_
_Note 2—New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group’’ for additional information._

76


-----

As a result of these changes in connection with the application of IFRS 16, the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended December 31, 2019,
particularly line items such as other current and non-current liabilities, selling expenses and other general
and administrative expenses, reflect the application depreciation and rent expense of IFRS 16, which
impacts their comparability to prior periods including the comparative figures as at and for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

**_The 2018 Legal Reorganization and Refinancings during the Historical Period_**

_The 2018 Legal Reorganization_

In 2018, we undertook a legal reorganization whereby a number of internal transfers of legal entities within
the Group as well as a number of legal mergers, de-mergers and partial de-mergers of various entities were
undertaken to simplify the legal structure of our Group. The Group was restructured such that all of the
top equity holdings for each of our business units and certain of such business units’ sub-holdings were
centralized under House of HR NV. As part of our legal reorganization, the shares held by minority
shareholders in our companies we had recently acquired were transferred to House of HR in exchange for
both cash and House of HR shares. The House of HR shares received by such minority shareholders
consisted of Ordinary C Shares, Class C convertible tracking shares (the ‘‘tracking shares’’) and
Preference Shares, with the tracking shares entitling their holders to dividend rights linked to the
performance of their respective operating company. This share roll-over with our former minority
shareholders aligns their interests with the economic performance of their applicable operating company
and the Group, and aims to foster local entrepreneurship and managerial ownership of operations for the
long term. See ‘‘Annual Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3.0—Group structure of the House of HR’’
for further information. In connection with this reorganization, we incurred A5.5 million in other general
and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 and an additional A0.5 million such
expenses were incurred in the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The legal
reorganization costs were paid in cash. See ‘‘Annual Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3.0—Group
_structure of the House of HR’’ for additional information._

_Senior Facilities_

The Group’s finance expenses have varied over the period under review largely in relation to the
refinancing of bank borrowings undertaken and related fees associated with the same. Our bank
borrowings as at January 1, 2017 were drawn under a senior facilities agreement at the Group level. The
nominal amount of the amounts drawn under that senior facility as at January 1, 2017, net of transaction
costs, was A307.7 million. The drawings had a maturity of five years and a variable interest rate based on
Euribor plus a fixed margin. During December 2017, these bank loans were refinanced with the then
existing senior facilities at the Group level, also with variable interest rates. The carrying amount of the
drawings, net of transaction costs, was A456.9 million as at December 31, 2017 and the drawings had seven
years of maturity and a variable interest rate based on Euribor plus a margin. In March 2018, the
additional tranche of A125 million was withdrawn under the same terms. The nominal amount of the
amounts drawn under the then existing senior facilities as at December 31, 2018, net of transaction costs,
was A583.5 million. During July 2019, we refinanced the existing senior facilities and entered into the
Senior Facilities Agreement. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities.’’ Our finance
expense varied during the period under review and reflects the terms agreed in the Senior Facilities
Agreement. In March 2020, the Group’s Revolving Credit Facility was drawn in the amount of A95 million,
as the Group sought to create additional liquidity during the prevailing uncertainty of the initial Covid-19
lockdown period, and the Group repaid such amount in June 2020. The carrying amount of the amounts
drawn under the Senior Facilities Agreement as at September 30, 2020, net of transaction costs, was
A524.6 million.

Apart from the Offering of Notes contemplated hereby, we do not currently expect to raise incremental
debt or equity financing over the next twelve months. However, going forward, there can be no assurance
of these expectations, as our projections could prove to be incorrect, events may occur that require
additional liquidity in excess of amounts available under our Term Loan B Facility. In such a situation, or
should an acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise, we would likely utilize borrowing capacity under our
Revolving Credit Facility or seek to raise additional equity or debt. See also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to Our Indebtedness—We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to_
_service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business’’and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks_

_debt obligations, which may not be successful’’._

**Key factors affecting our results of operations**

Our results of operations have been affected in the periods under review, and are expected to continue to
be affected, by various key factors relating to our business and industry, which we describe below.

**_General economic conditions_**

We generally operate in geographic markets that are characterized by high average salaries, low
unemployment and which are well developed and mature in the temporary staffing and consulting fields.
As a result of these trends the number of temporary workers in our largest markets has increased
significantly over the last decade.

Economic and trading conditions in the countries in which we operate, or which we plan to enter, have
impacted our business in the past and will likely impact our business in various ways. While our business
has historically generally been able to mitigate the fluctuations of the business cycle due to a flexible cost
structure, economic downturns can lead to a decrease in demand for our services. Similarly, growth in
national and international economies (i.e. GDP growth), particularly in the sectors in which we specialize,
can lead to increased demand for our services. Among our financial segments, general staffing has
historically been most sensitive to economic fluctuations, which has led to decreases in demand for such
services in connection with economic downturns, but has often exhibited an early resurgence after a
recession as companies often reach for this resource as they invest in the growth of their operations.
Conversely, our engineering and consulting, and specialized staffing segments have historically been more
‘‘defensive’’, and as a result may show the effects of economic fluctuations less intensely and may take
longer after any economic downturn to recover. We have observed this same pattern in 2020, as general
staffing has already returned to levels comparable to those seen in 2019 as measured by weekly productive
job candidates, outpacing specialized staffing and engineering and consulting to date. Productive job
candidates are defined as job candidates working at the customer premises, expressed in full time
equivalents.

In addition to these general trends, our results of operations have been impacted and we expect will
continue to be impacted by certain other key macroeconomic conditions, such as unemployment rates and
staffing penetration, in the geographic markets in which we operate. Low unemployment rates often
indicate a shortage of available workers in an economy, which can increase the demand for our job
candidates, whom we often recruit from other countries. Furthermore, increases in staffing penetration can
indicate a greater prevalence or acceptance of temporary staffing in an economy, which increases the
market for our services.

For further information relating to the outlook for the staffing solutions industry in our main geographical
markets, see ‘‘Industry and Market Overview’’.

Covid-19 has and may continue to impact demand for our staffing services. Historically, following periods
of crisis the Group has demonstrated an ability to rebound, in part based on its decentralized structure,
allowing for flexible decision making based on local needs and legislation, including revisions to incentive
based structures to adapt to the changed environment. Management believes that our strong geographical,
segment and sector diversification has allowed us to smooth the impact and recovery across the business.
This is demonstrated by our resilient pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin at 10.7% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020, with further recovery being experienced in October 2020, post third quarter
financial statements.

In particular, a number of measures that have been taken by governments to mitigate the spread of
Covid-19, including national and local government mandated lockdowns and other countermeasures, have
caused dramatic disruptions to our clients’ businesses. In the spring of 2020 different degrees of lockdowns
were introduced in each of our primary geographic markets of Belgium, France, Germany and the
Netherlands which had an immediate negative impact on demand for temporary workers. Following the
lifting of these restrictions in the middle of the second quarter of 2020, we experienced a gradual recovery
in the number of productive job candidates at work. However, softer lockdowns were introduced again in
the autumn of 2020 which led to a decrease, although to a lesser extent, in productive job candidates at
work. Potential future lockdown measures, such as shutting down production facilities and offices or
restricting free movement of transportation and distribution, closing of restaurant and bar facilities, no
hospitality at events, could disrupt our client’s businesses or ours more significantly in the future.

78


-----

During Covid-19, there have also been a number of government measures introduced, including in our
primary markets of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, which have positively contributed to
the Group’s ability to manage cash flows during the period and manage the costs associated with our
in-house employees and job candidates. However, a number of these measures have ended or are expected
to end in early 2021. For example, we have utilized certain postponement of VAT or other tax and benefit
payments and utilized temporary unemployment measures introduced that have allowed us to retain
certain in-house employees and job candidates without bearing the full expense for their wages and
salaries. As these government measures expire, we could experience additional costs and liabilities and
may also find it more difficult to retain in-house employees and job candidates if demand for our staffing
services does not increase or is variable due to the prolonged impact of Covid-19.

The table below shows the relative geographical distribution of our revenue over the historical accounting
period, which is primarily impacted by the nature of our operations and the breadth and depth of our
operational footprint in each country. However, macroeconomic trends within each country also contribute
to the performance of our operations in each of these countries.

_Belgium_

Our operations in Belgium are comprised of our specialized staffing and our engineering and consulting
segments. Revenue from our operations in Belgium grew steadily over the period from A478.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2017 to A695.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which includes
growth experienced on account of acquisitions. Revenue from our operations in Belgium declined from
A505.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to A406.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, primarily as a result of the lockdowns, resulting in fewer assignments for our
engineers and technicians in our Gritt business unit, and lower staffing levels in our Accent business unit.
This was most noticeable in the hospitality business and in the retail non-food segment, as a result of the
closures of shops, restaurants and pubs, as well as in certain industries in which our technicians specialize
that were also affected.

During this same period, data from the World Bank shows that annual GDP growth in Belgium was 1.9%,
1.5% and 1.4% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The European Commission forecasts that annual
GDP growth in Belgium in 2020 will be �8.4%. Belgium has also continued to experience a tightening in
the labor market as the population ages and there are fewer local workers to take the place of retirees.
Furthermore, Belgium has also been experiencing high employment rates due to employment outgrowing
the active population. Unemployment in Belgium has gone from 7.5% in 2007 (according to data from the
World Bank) to 5.7% in 2020 (according to data from Eurostat). Staffing penetration has also increased in
response to this tightening of the labor market and decrease in unemployment. In the near term, while
growth saturation of employment will likely slow our growth in Belgium in the private sector, the opening
of certain public sector opportunities may offset this slowdown to a certain degree. See also ‘‘—Changes in
_regulations—Temporary Employment Regulations’’._

Management believes that the impact of potential client default is limited. As an illustration, the historical
rate of insolvencies (as a percentage of company stock) in Belgium from 2007-2016, based on third party
market data, has ranged between 0.5% to a maximum of 2.2% for small and medium sized firms and below
0.5% for larger firms with over 250 employees, including during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

Accordingly, bad debt provisions as a percentage of sales in Accent have ranged steadily between 0% to
0.2% of sales, on an LTM basis, from 2017 through September 30, 2020.

_The Netherlands_

Our operations in the Netherlands are comprised of our specialized staffing and our engineering and
consulting segments. Revenue from our operations in the Netherlands grew steadily over the period from
A254.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to A548.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, which includes growth experienced on account of acquisitions. Revenue from our operations in the
Netherlands grew from A396.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to A431.6 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily as a result of steady performance in Covebo, a
change to the methods by which we accounted for search and selection revenues, and a further
improvement of the performance of Redmore. Redmore’s improvements were a result of continued
demand from banks and insurance companies, combined with low sickness rates and high chargeability of
consultants, who could work from home during the Covid-19 period. These increases were partially offset
by decreased performance by the Continu business unit, given that some assignments at customers were
stopped during the period.

During this same period, World Bank data shows that annual GDP growth was 2.9%, 2.6% and 1.8% in
2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, in the Netherlands. The European Commission forecasts annual GDP
growth of �5.3% in 2020 in the Netherlands. As is the case elsewhere, GDP growth in the Netherlands
affects us primarily through its effect on the end-markets in which our clients operate. Our engineering
and consulting and specialized staffing segments in the Netherlands are affected by growth in the
construction and engineering markets, which in turn are driven by overall domestic economic growth.
Long-term demographic and economic trends are also driving a demand for construction workers. After a
downturn from 2009 until 2012, the Dutch construction end-market has been growing significantly due in
part to general economic resurgence, low interest rates, as well an increase in environmentally-focused
project or larger infrastructure projects. These trends contribute to demand for job candidates with
specialties and skills that operate in the construction end-market.

The Netherlands also has a number of jobs that are driven by regulatory developments in addition to GDP
fluctuations. For example, demand for job candidates in the financial services sector is impacted by the
growth in financial regulation. This impacts demand for our services, due to the fact that, within our
engineering and consulting segment, our business unit Redmore provides job candidates with technical,
specialized skills to the financial sector.

The Netherlands, similarly to Belgium, has historically had low unemployment rates which impacts our
business positively. Between 2007 and 2014, the unemployment rate in the Netherlands rose from 4.2% to
7.4% (according to data from the World Bank), but then decreased to 3.0% in 2020 (according to data
from Eurostat). This low unemployment rate has led to fewer local individuals going into the strenuous
working conditions of the logistics workforce, which has supported demand for our job candidates,
including our foreign job candidates, who have experience in this sector and can meet demand for such
jobs.

_Germany_

Our operations in Germany are comprised of our general staffing and our engineering and consulting
segments. Revenue from our operations in Germany grew over the period from A298.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to A392.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely due to growth
experienced on account of acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our general staffing
segment, which is almost entirely in Germany, experienced only minimal Organic Growth due in part to
the macroeconomic conditions described below. Revenue from our operations in Germany declined from
A299.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to A237.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, both as a result of (i) the continued impact from the AUG reform that occurred in the
course of 2019, which reduced our daily sales and people at work during 2019, resulting in a smaller
starting size for the business as at the beginning of 2020, combined with (ii) the local lockdowns and
reduced demand in Germany following Covid-19, which also heavily impacted our Aero business.
Additionally, the continued trend of lower demand in the German automotive sector weighed on results in
the period. Currently, the decreasing trend is reversing in Germany, resulting in a higher number of people
at work compared to 2019, which will normally result in a higher starting point for the following years.

Annual GDP growth in Germany has been 2.5%, 1.5% and 0.5% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively
according to data from the World Bank. The European Commission forecasts annual GDP growth of
�5.6% in 2020 in Germany. In Germany, our general staffing sector is GDP-sensitive and exposes us more
directly to fluctuations in GDP and economic change. As GDP slows, market value grows at a slower pace
and the number of hours worked by an individual decreases. However, low-skilled, mainly blue collar
workers are in structural shortage in Germany, which provides opportunities for our services.

80


-----

Unemployment in Germany is currently at a record-low point, and is expected to remain at this level in the
upcoming years. Between 2007 and 2020, unemployment fell from 8.7% (according to data from the World
Bank) to 3.0% (according to data from Eurostat). Companies are, therefore, expected to continue to
address staff shortages through temporary staffing. Moreover, we believe that generally lower-skilled
workers do not travel as much, which can lead to significantly localized shortages in demand. Some
companies, including ours, overcome this barrier through sourcing in Eastern Europe where lower skilled
workers are willing to travel. Decreasing unemployment and shortages of low-skilled blue collar workers
has driven an increased reliance on temp workers leading to an increase in demand for our services.

The automotive end-market is an important driver of demand for job candidates in Germany due to its
relative size within the overall German economy. However, during the period under review, the German
automotive sector experienced certain events that negatively impacted it and its demand for services. For
example, beginning in 2015, evidence began to indicate and eventually was confirmed that certain diesel
car manufacturers had been tampering with their vehicles’ ability to pass emissions tests and the vehicles
were emitting significantly more than the legal limit of pollutants. In response, certain European and other
authorities have taken measures to mitigate vehicle pollution, which has led to an increase in investment in
clean vehicle technologies and a decrease in demand for diesel vehicles. The additional costs of these
investments have impacted the need for certain car manufacturers to hire additional workers or source
additional temporary job candidates.

Furthermore, low water levels of the Rhine caused by droughts limited barge shipping in Germany in the
autumn of 2018. The resulting shortages in supply of certain industrial commodities, such as coal and
motor fuel, curtailed industrial production in certain locations in Germany, which we believe also impacted
the demand for our job candidates in certain end-markets for which our general staffing segment typically
provides services.

Finally, the staffing industry specifically was impacted by certain German regulatory reforms, including the
Act on Staffing (Arbeitnehmer¨uberlassungsgesetz) (‘‘AUG[¨] ’’). See’’—Changes in regulations—Temporary
_Employment Regulations’’._

However, during this period our Organic Growth was impacted less than certain of our peers as shown in
the chart below.

undue reliance on the inclusion of such information and it should not be regarded as an indication of
what our performance would have actually been compared to that our competitors.

_Organic growth definition for peers_

_Adecco:_ For Adecco, growth is defined as its revenue figures that exclude the impact of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures.

_Randstad:_ Randstad’s normalized growth is measured by excluding the impact of currency effects,
acquisitions, disposals and reclassifications.

_Manpower:_ Manpower’s normalized growth is based on its ‘‘organic constant currency’’, which
removes the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from
the constant currency calculation.

_France_

Our operations in France are comprised of our engineering and consulting segment. Revenue from our
operations in France grew over the period from A82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
A109.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which includes growth experienced on account of the
acquisition of Fratech. In April 2019, we have also acquired Mykelson and Pharmacos, which we expect to
increase our revenue generated in France going forward. Revenue from our operations in France declined
from A81.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to A75.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020, primarily as a result of Covid-19 ending a number of assignments and projects
at customers.

In France, we only provide engineering consulting under our engineering and consulting segment, which
has historically been insulated to a significant degree from GDP fluctuations.

The unemployment rate in France has increased from 7.7% (according to the World Bank) to 8.3%
(according to Eurostat) between 2007 and 2020, which is higher than the other countries in which we work.
However, because we operate in a specialized sector in France, the structurally high unemployment in
France has not impacted demand for our services in a material manner, nor do we expect it to do so in the
future, once the market has recovered from the impact of Covid-19.

_Brexit_

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (‘‘U.K.’’) held a referendum (the ‘‘U.K. EU Referendum’’) on its
membership of the EU, in which a majority voted for the U.K. to leave the EU (‘‘Brexit’’). There remains
significant uncertainty relating to the U.K.’s exit from, and future relationship with, the EU. On March 29,
2017, the U.K. Prime Minister gave notice under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on the European Union and
officially notified the European Union of the U.K.’s intention to withdraw from the EU. The delivery of
the Article 50(2) notice triggered a two-year period of negotiation to determine the terms on which the
U.K. will exit the EU and the framework for the U.K’s future relationship with the EU, which was
extended (the ‘‘Article 50 Withdrawal Agreement’’). At present, the U.K. has formally left the EU but
remains in a transitional period that extends the application of European Union law, and provide for
continuing access to the European Union single market, until the end of 2020, pending agreements on a
range of trade related issues that are subject to negotiations between the parties.

As the U.K. represents a key export market for several of the countries in which we operate, particularly
Belgium and the Netherlands, adverse trade terms between the U.K. and the countries in which we operate
could have an adverse effect on the economies of these countries, which could by extension adversely affect
our business.

Furthermore, Brexit may limit the ability of individuals from various foreign countries to work in the U.K.,
which could increase the supply of job candidates in several of the countries in which we operate. We
believe that there has already been a transition of job candidates, who were working in or planning to work
in the U.K., from the U.K. to other countries, including certain of our geographic markets such as the
Netherlands and Germany, in anticipation of Brexit. However, we believe that this trend has not
significantly impacted our Gross Margin.

See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our results of operations could be materially
_adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions.’’_

**_Changes in regulation_**

While the markets in which we operate tend to be fairly stable from a legal and regulatory perspective,
from time to time there are changes that may impact the performance of our business. Our industry is
extensively regulated by regulatory authorities in each of the countries in which we operate and at an EU
level. These regulations impact how we structure our employment agreements with job candidates and our
service agreements with clients. See ‘‘Regulation’’. During the period under review, certain changes in the
_regulatory frameworks, particularly in Germany, impacted our results of operations. New legislation has also_
_been passed in the Netherlands that will take effect from January 1, 2020 and may impact our results in the_
_Netherlands as a result._

_Temporary Employment Regulation_

Regulations around temporary employment can impact the clients and opportunities that are available to
us. For example, as from the 2017 to 2018 period, the Belgian region of Flanders and the Belgian federal
government authorized temporary employment in the public sector for periods of up to twelve months,
which has provided additional opportunities to place temporary employees within these sectors. While this
practice is still not permitted in the Belgian region of Wallonia, if in the future and to the extent that this
region adopts a similar policy, it could further increase our ability to provide our services in that region.

Moreover, regulations can affect the duration of our services. In Germany, since the last reform of the
AUG in April 2017, the assignment period of temporary workers was limited to 18 months (with[¨]
exceptions) after which the employee either needs to be let go from the company where they were working
or accepted on to the general payroll of that company. As a result, as our job candidates approach the end
of their assignment period they will either need to be replaced, which can be difficult during times of
scarcity of qualified job candidates, or are taken over by the client resulting in lower volumes for us.
Furthermore, wages and benefits of temporary workers are aligned to those of the employees of the
company after nine months of uninterrupted assignment (through the ‘‘EqualPay’’ mechanism), but must
be paid by the staffing solutions provider, which increases the administrative burden on us.

In the Netherlands there have been low-wage benefits regulations (‘‘LIV’’) which create subsidies for the
employment of low-wage workers since January 2017. This law is aimed at incentivizing employers to hire
employees who have a vulnerable position in the labor market. However, recent reviews of these incentives
have resulted in cuts to the maximum compensation to the normal LIV as of 2020, while the youth LIV will
be cut 50% in 2020 and will phase out completely in 2024. This will result in lower subsidies obtained in
2020 as compared to prior years, especially in Covebo, despite comparable turnover. Moreover, under the
Wet Aanpak Schijnconstructies (‘‘WAS’’) regulation, cost related to workers, can be withheld from
workers’ wages only if the wage remains above net minimum wage (since January 2016). However,
deductions are still allowed below minimum wage for pension and healthcare insurance. All other
deductions are not allowed if the net salary then becomes below minimum wage. For these non-deducted
costs, we send invoices to the workers. If workers do not pay their invoices and return to their country of
origin, we are left with the costs. This regulation has no impact for the clients.

Significant Dutch law changes came into effect with respect to temporary agency work and payrolling,
amongst others. From January 1, 2020, the Balanced Labor Market Act (Wet Arbeidsmarkt in balans)
(‘‘WAB’’) came into into effect. For example, there will be increased social security charges for temporary
staffing agencies in their capacity as employer. Furthermore, payroll employees will be entitled to all terms
and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions. These regulations came into effect in 2020
and our cost of services has increased, but simultaneously also our sales prices increased. We currently see
that we have been able to pass on the majority of these increases in costs to our clients through higher fees
charged for our services. Nevertheless, this leads to an increased cost for our services at the customers,
which may lead to customers questioning the relatively higher cost of temporary/flexible staffing versus
hiring permanent employees, thus reducing their demand for our services. This impact cannot yet be seen,
given the Covid-19 impact today, where Covid-19 may lead to both increased demand for flexibility, but at
the same time, may also lead to additional focus on cost savings at our customers, leading to less use of
temporary work. To the extent we are not able to continue passing through associated costs, either due to
existing service agreement terms, market conditions, or otherwise the implementation of WAB may also
result in decreases to our Gross Margin.

For a further discussion of the regulatory framework in which we conduct our business in our principal
geographic end-markets, see ‘‘Regulation’’.

-----

_Tax Regulation_

Changes in tax law can impact our current and future tax liabilities, and can also lead to reversals of certain
deferred tax income balances. For example, the Belgian Corporate Income Tax regime has been modified
by the Belgian Government by means of the Corporate Income Tax Reform Act of December 25, 2017
(Official Gazette of December 29, 2017). As a result of the reform, we remeasured our deferred income
tax balances. Deferred income tax expected to be reversed in the year to December 31, 2018 and
December 31, 2019 has been measured using the effective rate that will apply in Belgium for the period
(29.58%). Deferred income tax expected to be reversed beyond December 31, 2019 has been measured
with an effective rate of 25%.

Further, the Corporate Income Tax regime in the Netherlands has been modified. This reform includes a
reduction of the corporate tax rate from 25% from the year ending December 31, 2018 and 2019 to 22.55%
from the year ending December 31, 2020, with a further decrease to 20.5% as from the year ending
December 31, 2021.

_Financial regulation_

While regulations on banking, insurance and the financial industry as a whole only have an indirect
material effect on our business, recent regulatory developments in the financial industry between 2016 and
2019, including the updates to the financial supervision amendment Act, the Packaged Retail and
Insurance-based Investment Products regulation, the Capital Markets Union, the International Financial
Reporting Standards, final documents on the Reform of Basel III (‘‘Basel IV’’), Customer DD/Know your
Customer regulations, the Uniform Calculation Method-Uniform pension calculation, and the new EU
Directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision
(‘‘IORP II’’), have created a heightened need for specialized employees, which can create additional
demand for our job candidates who focus on compliance and legal matters in the financial industry.

**_Drivers of sales and pricing_**

_Organic Growth_

In addition to the sales growth created through the acquisitions discussed above, (see ‘‘—Comparability of
_Our Consolidated Financial Statements—Acquisitions, disposals and the Comparability of our Consolidated_
_Financial Statements’’), our sales are impacted by the Organic Growth of our business. We measure_
Organic Growth by analyzing revenue growth between one financial period and the comparable prior
period, excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue as follows:

- in respect of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no
acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019 or that divestments have taken place as of January 1,
2019;

- in respect of revenue for 2019 (compared against 2018), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions
on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2018; and

- in respect of revenue for 2018 (compared against 2017), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions
on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2017.

The key drivers of the Organic Growth of our business are:

- increasing our geographic footprint by opening new branches with our ‘‘cell division’’ approach, see
‘‘Our Business—Our Strengths—We are well positioned to restart our outstanding record of both organic
_and external growth.’’;_

- winning new contracts with clients;

- expanding our work with existing clients;

- sourcing additional job candidates that can fill scarce assignments held by our clients;

- increasing candidate sourcing through international recruitment;

- digitalization;

- expanding into new business lines; and

84


-----

- pricing growth.

We seek to minimize the financial risk of new offices by focusing on securing new sales in a geographic
region before committing to additional costs of a new office there. Historically, we have successfully hired
additional sales employees onto our payroll to win new contracts with clients; our business unit Continu
has notably successfully employed this approach. Furthermore, our business units Accent and Covebo have
had success in sourcing additional job candidates by expanding their international recruiting networks.
When doing bolt-on acquisitions in new but matching sectors, we have successfully expanded these services
to existing branches, as proven by Continu with the acquisition of MT&V.

Moreover, our Organic Growth is impacted by our ability to improve the utilization of job candidates and
reduce our bench time, see ‘‘—Gross Margin—Bench time/Utilization’’, increasing our sales in time and
material contracts over any given period.

Our ability to expand our business geographically by opening offices in new locations also functions as an
incentive to reward employees who have demonstrated strong results and initiative and would be
well-suited to lead new offices. We typically open new offices when we receive a significant number of
requests from existing clients or prospective clients to provide services in new locations or when we see
increasing demand for our services coming from a specific region. Expansion through opening new offices
has positively impacted and is expected to continue to impact our operating profits.

_Staffing volume_

The key drivers of staffing volume in any given market are the macro-economic and sector specific growth,
and the labor tightness, see ‘‘—General economic conditions‘‘discussed above and the regulatory
_environment, see Changes in regulations’’ above._

**_Pricing_**

We have a very diverse client base and generate revenue from a large number of clients. For the year
ended December 31, 2019, we had 25,129 unique clients. Furthermore, we do not have significant client
concentration, with our top client representing 1.5% and our top ten clients representing 8.2% of our
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

The substantial majority of our service agreements with clients are time and material contracts. Under
fixed price contracts, we bear the risk of cost overruns if we are not able to complete the project within the
allotted time, as the revenue we receive will be the same regardless of the number of hours we spend on
the project. With time and material contracts, on the other hand, we are compensated for the time that our
job candidates spend with a client on assignment. However, we are exposed to bench time risk, which arises
due to the nature of our employment agreements with certain job candidates as a result of regulatory
requirements or in order to attract and retain suitable job candidates. This risk particularly arises within
our engineering and consulting segment and to a lesser extent within our other segments, as a result of our
job candidates being on our payroll but not being used on a paid job assignment. As their employer, we are
still responsible for their costs even if they are not generating money for our operations. To mitigate the
bench time risk, we carefully monitor our job candidates that are our employees with indefinite term
contracts and seek to minimize their bench time by lining up assignments to transition to once a current
one is complete.

Most of our specialized service contracts allow us to enter back to back contracts with the client and our
job candidates, thus eliminating bench time risk. Under these types of contracts the utilization risk of the
job candidates in between contracts is reduced. However, in Germany temporary workers are required to
be on the temporary employment company’s payroll, which creates bench time risk for us with regards to
our job candidates in our general staffing segment. However, in many cases bench time is limited, as
temporary workers’ contracts can usually be terminated in, on average, two weeks’ notice, unless we decide
to retain them. See also ‘‘Our Business—Business Model’’.

The prices for services change in part due to inflation and in part due to the end-market and scarcity of the
position in question. Pricing for specialized staffing and general staffing is generally based on a factor
charged as a percentage of the job candidate’s gross salary. The relevant spread can be different depending
on the end-market and the position. The hourly and daily pricing model for engineering and consulting
positions generally produces higher Gross Margins than spread pricing based on the job candidates’ gross
salaries. Moreover, the spreads are generally higher in specialized staffing than in general staffing, typically
driven by the scarcity of the more specialized role and as a means of compensating us for our role in

85


-----

sourcing such job candidates. Regulations require that job candidates through our services are paid the
same as local or company-sourced workers.

In our specialized staffing segment, in our Vialegis, Redmore, Zaquensis andContinu business unit and a
few smaller business sub-units, we also perform a limited amount of work under search and selection
contracts. Unlike for other types of contracts, the full amount of the commissions typically remains with us
as it is not subject to cost of services or other deductions. However, in such arrangements we do not benefit
from a share of the on-going revenue during the duration of the employment as we do in other contracts.
Furthermore, in the case of freelancers, rather than receiving a salary from us, the freelancers submit
invoices to us for the services they have provided to the relevant client, which often produce smaller Gross
Margins. See ‘‘Staffing Solutions Industry Trends—Freelancing’’.

_Competition_

Our results of operations are impacted by the levels of competition that we experience in each of the
markets in which we operate and in any new markets that we may enter. We compete with other firms
offering HR solutions to both clients and job candidates to varying degrees in each of the geographical
markets and staffing segments in which we operate. Competition for both of these groups is based on a
variety of factors. Competitive factors in obtaining and retaining clients can include the ability to find job
candidates with the appropriate skills and/or experience, brand awareness, quality, speed of client service,
proximity to the client and particularly in relation to general staffing, price. Competitive factors in
obtaining and retaining job candidates can include wages, quality of engagement, number of hours of work
available, responsiveness to work schedules, personal validation of the job candidates and brand image.

On large contracts, which are more common in our general staffing segment, there is often pressure on
pricing due to the increased competitiveness in the industry. There is often less pricing pressure in our
engineering and consulting and special staffing segments, due to the scarcity of candidates to fill certain
roles. As a result, these segments and the higher margins associated with these fields are becoming
increasingly attractive to firms in the industry.

In certain of our key geographic markets, such as the Netherlands, the specialized HR solutions market is
relatively mature with comparatively established pricing. However, across all four of our key geographic
markets the industry is fragmented. In individual markets and specialist sectors, we compete with smaller,
more localized or more specialized firms. In addition, because of the trend towards consolidation in the
specialized HR solutions industry, we compete with larger full-service and specialized competitors in the
international, national, regional and local markets. In addition, some current and prospective clients,
particularly among larger corporates, may elect not to fill their staffing requirements from outside sources,
and may instead hire independent contractors directly on a temporary basis or provide similar services
internally. Many clients use more than one staffing services provider, and the majority of client
relationships are non-exclusive.

Websites, search engines and online job boards, such as Google for Jobs, monsterboard.nl and Indeed are
improving their matching capabilities, potentially affecting part of our business. Furthermore, pricing,
promotional and marketing actions of our competitors may impact our business, such that our price levels
could be impacted or that we need to invest more in marketing and advertising to obtain the right
candidates.

For a further discussion of our competitors in each of our divisions, see ‘‘Industry and Market Overview’’.
_See also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The employment services sector is highly_
_competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully in our markets.’’_

expenses for the periods indicated, as well as the percentage of revenue they comprised in each respective

period. These costs and expenses represented our most significant operating costs and expenses during the
period under review and are expected to continue to be our primary ones in the future.

_Cost of Services_

Cost of services comprises costs directly attributable to revenue, which mainly relate to costs associated
with our job candidates, such as their wages and salaries, social security charges, training costs, other
benefits (including housing expenses, car leases, mobility costs, vouchers for meals and other incentives,
such as reimbursements to job candidates for utilizing environmentally friendly transportation solutions as
well as other benefits for job candidates), and costs associated with freelancers. A small portion of these
costs relates to material costs for projects performed in Gritt Projects, which has been divested in 2020.
Our job candidates’ wages and salaries, social security and other benefits amounted to our largest cost of
services during the period under review. The principal factor that affects these costs is the number of job
candidates that we employ. As a result, these costs increase as we add additional job candidates either
through growing our business organically or through acquisitions. However, our overall number of job
candidates may not be representative of our expected cost of services since these costs will be impacted by
the level of compensation each job candidate receives, which is in turn linked to the specializations,
qualifications and positions filled by each job candidate.

During the period of Covid-19, attracting foreign nationals entailed additional costs, given restrictions on
crossing borders and additional quarantine measures and isolation requirements, which led to increased
numbers of days of unproductivity, with the result of increased housing expenses and provision of groceries
for candidates arriving from abroad. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2020, our cost of
services decreased by 10.0%, from A960.7 million to A864.7 million. This was in parallel with a 10.2%
decrease in revenue during the period, from A1,292.5 million to A1,161.1 million. The majority of these
costs are variable in nature, as Accent, Continu, Covebo, ZAQUENSIS and TimePartner mainly employ
workers whose contracts can be terminated immediately, or who can be put on the bench without cost, as
well as freelancers. For workers with less flexible conditions, these activities were generally able to benefit
from economic unemployment measures. GRITT, Abylsen, Aero, ibb and Vialege, who employ specialists
under permanent contracts and whose costs of services are therefore semi-variable, benefited from
economic unemployment measures, which decreased related costs. These companies also use freelancers,
for whom costs are fully variable.

Additionally, following Covid-19 insurance companies generally have begun to raise prices, which we may
not be able to fully reflect in our sales negotiations. Given the nature of our operations, which typically
results in us placing our job candidates on our payroll while they are on assignment, we are required to
insure a significant number of persons against work accidents. As temporary staffing often runs at a poor
loss ratio for insurers, including ours in the recent past, this could result in further significant premium
increase in the future unless we can find a suitable alternative or unless we experience a decline in
insurable events. For 2021, for Accent, we estimate that this could lead to no more than an additional
A2.8 million in cost, and that such cost will be partly offset by customer compensations and efforts to lower
accident occurrence and further offset by other cost reductions, following efficiencies realized in other
departmental costs within Accent.

Ransomware and other cyber risks have increased in general during Covid-19 and also require us to invest
in a higher standard of back-up procedures as work from home and remote working practices
predominate, especially in relation to compliance with data protection laws, avoidance of misappropriation
and cyber theft, leading to higher operating costs for our information technologies, as additional work,
licenses and expertise is needed to detect and prevent adverse occurrences.

87

_Gross Margin_

Our Gross Margin represents our gross profit (our revenue less our cost of services) divided by our
revenue. Our Gross Margin was 24.7%, 25.5% and 25.9% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018
and 2019, and 25.7% and 25.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

There are two primary drivers of our Gross Margin: the bill-pay spread and the bench time/utilization of
our job candidates (particularly our job candidates in our engineering and consulting segment):

- _Bill-pay spread: We will typically enter into an employment agreement with the job candidate (often_
for the duration of an assignment or longer in the case of certain business units) and we will enter into
a placement contract or project contract with the client. We then bill the client for the services
performed by the job candidate and pay the salary of the job candidate. The difference between what
we bill our clients and what we pay as salary to the job candidates is referred to as the ‘‘bill-pay
spread’’ and it is the key driver of our profitability. See ‘‘—Pricing.’’

- _Bench time/Utilization: Job candidates in most of our engineering and consulting business units as well_
as our job candidates in Germany are our permanent employees on our payroll whether or not they
are on assignment with a client. As a result, our engineering and consulting segment in particular
carefully monitors the end date of all job candidates’ assignments and aims to line up the next
assignment before their current ones come to an end. This monitoring seeks to minimize ‘‘bench
time’’, which is the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a client assignment.
By minimizing a job candidate’s bench time, we aim to ensure the job candidate is being utilized on a
project that requires his or her skill set, so there is a match between what we bill the client for the job
candidate’s services and what we pay the job candidate. New assignments also ensure future career
development of the job candidate. Furthermore, the impact of utilization upon the Group’s Gross
Margin will also depend on the mix of job candidates whose utilization is impacted, with the more
specialized job candidates typically performing work under contracts with higher bill-pay spreads as a
result of their scarcity and specialization. As most of our contracts are on a time and materials basis,
increased utilization rates will typically improve the Group’s Gross Margin.

Additionally, the Covid-19 period has presented an additional impact on the Group’s Gross Margin as a
result of various local government measures providing partial compensation for temporary unemployment,
such as furlough schemes. In certain cases, for example in France, we retained job candidates on our
payroll but the government measures did not provide full compensation for such candidates; therefore, the
Group company responsible for the candidate still had to pay a portion of the compensation.

Due to the difference in Gross Margin between our various segments, our segment mix can affect the
overall Gross Margin of our Group. See below for the revenue split between our three segments for the
years ending December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020.

**For the nine**
**For the year ended** **months ended**

Additionally, the difference in Gross Margin between various types of contracts can also affect the overall
Gross Margin of the Group. See ‘‘—Pricing’’. For example, our search and selection services, such as those
_provided by our Vialegis business unit and certain other small business units, are based on commissions earned_
_for job candidates sourced for clients. We receive less revenue from such services because we only locate the_
_candidate and then receive a search and selection commission, rather than a contract with the client that also_
_includes such job candidate’s wages or salary, social security and other benefits to be paid out and administered_
_by us. However, such contracts tend to provide a higher Gross Margin since there are no subsequent costs to_
_deduct from the commissions received._

_Selling Expenses_

Selling expenses during the period under review comprised the wages and salaries (including variable pay
and incentive pay), social security charges and other benefits (such as accommodation expenses) for
in-house employees responsible for operational activities at our branches, as well as advertising and
marketing (including internal marketing), amortization of customer relationships and brand names that
were originally valued in the context of various business combinations and other selling expenses. Selling
expenses are primarily impacted by the number of in-house employees we employ. As a result, selling
expenses will increase when we grow our operations and the number of in-house employees that we have
who manage the recruiting lifecycle and oversee the sourcing, selection and placement of our job
candidates on assignment. During 2020, Covid-19 has also resulted in an increase in such selling expenses,
to the extent no government measures were available. In Accent in particular, we paid a one-time
additional bonus to members of our commercial team during the second and third quarters, in recognition
of extraordinary continuing contributions during the Covid-19 period.

_Other general and administrative expenses_

Other general and administrative expenses comprise personnel and accommodation expenses of head
offices, IT expenses, depreciation expenses largely relating to charges on capitalized buildings, cars and
software, and other general and administrative expenses at the headquarters level, as well as share-based
payments. During the period under review, our share-based payments consisted of our option plan ‘‘We
are One’’ offered to the management of Accent (our ‘‘share option plan’’), several ratchet schemes offered
to key management at different acquired business units (Abylsen, Covebo, Continu, TimePartner,
Zaquensis & TEC Alliance) (‘‘ratchet schemes’’), and our new long-term incentive plan at the level of
shareholders of House of HR (‘‘long-term incentive plan’’). In 2017, in connection with the anticipated
2018 legal reorganization, we decided to settle the existing share option plan, which was done partially in
cash and partially through the issuance of new shares at the House of HR level, and the ratchet schemes.
The payments made in connection with these settlements totalled A59.7 million, which consisted of a
payment of A40.4 million to settle the share option plan and payments totalling A19.2 million to settle the
ratchet schemes. In 2018 and 2019, we recognized A14.0 million and A4.6 million, respectively, in sharebased payments connected to option grants made under our long-term incentive plan launched in 2018. In
the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized A3.5 million in share-based payments connected
to option grants made under the same long-term incentive plan. See ‘‘Annual Consolidated Financial
_Statements—Note 18—Share-based payments’’ for additional information._

**Staffing Solutions Industry Trends**

In addition to the key factors above, there are also certain trends that could play a significant role in our
results of operations in the future as these trends become more prevalent or as our operations in such
areas develop and grow. See also ‘‘Industry and Market Overview—Staffing Solutions Secular Industry
_Drivers’’. These include: freelancing, specialization, AI and digitization, and reskilling._

**_Freelancing_**

There is an increasing trend towards freelancing in end-markets where we operate, also known as the
so-called ‘‘gig economy’’, which has led to increased demand for flexible working. Whereas most of our
services are provided through time and materials contracts, we sometimes work with freelancers when
there is otherwise a scarcity of job candidates in the market for a certain position. Moreover, certain job
candidates, especially for high-level positions and positions in IT, prefer to work as freelancers. Rather
than receiving a salary from us, freelancers submit invoices to us for the services they have provided to the
relevant client. While we generally receive a smaller Gross Margin with freelancers, due to the high
salaries that freelancers often receive, this Gross Margin amount can still lead to significant contributions
to our revenue. While we believe that the number of freelance workers appears to have stabilized in
various markets, if the trend of using freelancers continues, it could adversely affect our Gross Margin.
Nevertheless in the Netherlands, increasingly politicians are starting to see the disadvantages of
freelancers, especially for low cost jobs, since these freelancers do not accrue, nor save for future pension
requirements, thus increasing potential poverty at a later age. Some proposals currently under
consideration involve a minimum ‘rate’ requirement, before people would be allowed to move into
freelance or a mandatory pension requirement. This would increase the cost of freelancers and potentially
move companies back to the usage of temporary work as a flexible staffing solution.

-----

**_Specialization_**

There is a trend in our industry of increasingly specialized companies. This trend may lead to increased
competition in fields where we currently provide engineering and consulting or specialized staffing. It may
also require us to increase the specialization of our own businesses in order to meet the developing
expectations of our clients and job candidates. Furthermore, we believe that a failure to specialize in
certain markets could lead to a gradual erosion of our Gross Margin. We seek to increase our
specializations both through acquisitions of specialized entities, and through Organic Growth into
specializations, often in fields that are related to those in which we already operate. We currently do not
favor greenfield expansions into new specializations due to the increased risk associated with such a model.
The loss in volume created by a shift towards specialization is generally offset by the increase in Gross
Margin that the specialization produces.

**_AI and digitization_**

The different steps of the value chain of our activities include a complex mix of tasks that have the
potential for high automation (such as job sourcing and candidate matching) and those that need to be
more tailor-made for clients and job candidates and therefore require a human touch (such as interacting
with clients to know precisely what their staffing needs are and negotiation of HR contracts). As AI
becomes more sophisticated it allows us to digitize and deploy AI in our core business and experiment with
new technologies. We employ AI and digitalization to increase our revenue potential, for example, through
expanding our digital footprint to find new job candidates. We also use these features to decrease our costs
and expenses, such as by allowing software to conduct initial screening interviews with prospective job
candidates. We believe that AI and other forms of digitization can also allow us to outpace smaller
competitors who do not have the resources to match these capabilities. However, segments with high levels
of complexity, such as engineering and consulting, have less digitization potential. Moreover, SMEs will
likely continue to value human interaction, which may insulate this field to a certain extent from
technology-focused competitors. It should also be noted that the degree to which we will be able to include
digitization into our daily operations, also depends on our access to such technology and the degree to
which we are able to keep up with technological advancements. As other may gain more expertise in this
field, this could reduce our competitive advantage. At the same time, versus smaller players we also may
have the advantage in this field, given our size and current investments in this area. For additional
information see ‘‘Our Business—Information Technology and Innovation—Innovation’’.

**_Reskilling_**

The rapid technological development in numerous end-markets reduces the demand for certain skill sets
that are rapidly becoming obsolete and increases the need for new skill sets required to satisfy the needs of
positions leveraging these new technologies. While we already engage in reskilling of job candidates, the
acceleration of technological development may increase the demand for these types of services.
Furthermore, individuals who are searching for more varied career paths also often require reskilling,
which is a dynamic that is growing among younger demographics as well. Reskilling can often take the
form of on-the-job training provided by temporary work. We believe that we stand to benefit from the
investments we have made to be able to offer training and reskilling programs for job seekers through
additional revenue opportunities.

**_Impact of Covid-19 and the Group’s Response_**

Concomitant with its global and market-wide impact, Covid-19 has negatively affected our business, results
of operations and financial condition in 2020. Our results of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, decreased A131.5 million, or 10.2%, from A1,292.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to A1,161.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily as a
result of Covid-19 as further described under ‘‘—Results of Operations—Comparison of our results of
_operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 with September 30, 2020’’_

In response to this unprecedented situation, we modified certain of our operational practices and changed
how we communicate both internally and with customers; we implemented additional protective
procedures; and we accessed temporary government measures that were advantageous to us.

In respect of sales in our markets, our response included keeping branches open to the extent possible,
such that that large majority of our branch network continues to exist post-lockdowns, as management
sought to preserve stability in terms of access to customers. Temporary Unemployment measures were

90


-----

utilized in order to retain experienced and trained staff members, while we undertook various initiatives
and loyalty programmes for staff of platforms and operating companies, including motivational training.
We also awarded special bonuses in respect of extraordinary efforts with new customers, and for boosting
sales in the initial months after the first lock-down. This was especially done in Accent, where special
regional growth bonuses were awarded, structured to allow for increased collaboration on a region-wide
basis, and speed bonuses, for those offices that were the first to return to financial performance in line with
2019 figures.

We managed our costs of services, where possible, by placing consultants or temporary workers on
temporary unemployment or similar schemes (depending on available government assistance in each of
our markets) in order to keep our workforce intact to the extent possible, so as to be able to place these
candidates back on customer assignment once customers resumed hiring. In Continu, consultants were also
kept on the payroll, and were kept on the bench so as to allow them to return to work after the virus’s first
wave. This approach paid off during the summer, when the large majority of people on the bench were
back at work with a customer.

Expenses were reduced by placing internal staff on temporary unemployment where revenue necessitated
this, for example in branches that were inactive because the sector had closed (e.g. retail non-food, horeca
segment). In March, in Accent, this was done as of March 18, 2020, the first day this was allowed by the
authorities. In Abylsen, internal staff were not put on temporary unemployment, thereby permitting them
to remain close to those consultants that were still at the customer, allowing us to continue to detect
further opportunities with those customers that were still active during the first lock-down.

Marketing expenses and other expenses were reduced to the minimum required in 2020, while also being
retooled in an effort to draw interest, such as webinars we organized for customers to explain the impact
government measures.

The Group’s Pro Forma Adjusted capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were
A10.8 million, marking a decrease as compared to recent prior years, as management sought to protect cash
levels during Covid-19. Flexibility was achieved by means of a postponement of non-IT related capital
expenditures. IT investments were an exception, which proved crucial during the increasing digitization
brought by Covid-19, as well as for the future strategy of the Group.

On a pro forma adjusted basis, M&A related expenditures of A15.5 million were mainly linked to the
acquisition of Techmatch and the earn-out for Eurojob, and the Group incurred A24.5 million in corporate
income tax, resulting in total cash flow pre-interest and pre-leases of A111.6 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2020.

As a precautionary measure, we also drew down on our Revolving Credit Facility in March 2020 in the
amount of A95 million, which we subsequently repaid in June 2020 and which is now fully undrawn. The
Group preserved strong total liquidity between A200 million and A300 million at all times throughout 2020
(including the Revolving Credit Facility), by means of the cost saving measures described above, and by
maintaining a focus on credit collections and the conversion of accounts receivable into cash, leading to
limited bad debt. Our total liquidity as at November 24, 2020 was A249 million, with cash on balance sheet
of A154 million and A95 million available through the Revolving Credit Facility. This excludes A19.9 million
available through the commercial finance programme, and it is inclusive of the repayment of a NOW grant
(Dutch government aid) of A11.2 million in mid-November 2020 by Covebo.

The operating companies’ chief financial officers monitored payment behaviour closely during the period.
Special attention was paid to receivables and days sales outstanding (‘‘DSO’’), such that DSO was at
52 days as at September 30, 2020, comparable to 51 days as at September 30, 2019.

We expect the ultimate significance of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows will be dictated by whether there is a continued and ongoing resurgence
in the spread of Covid-19 in our primary markets, the length of time that such circumstances continue, and
whether a vaccine becomes widely available.

Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations will differ in respect of the current year and
for future periods, when compared to the historical financial condition and results of operations presented
in this discussion. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’

**Description of Certain Income Statement Line Items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue consists of the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the services rendered
during the year to third parties. We mainly derive revenue from the transfer of services over time and at a
point in time in the following segments: engineering and consulting, specialized staffing, and general
staffing.

We mainly generate revenue from offering HR staffing solutions to our clients. The duration of these HR
staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two years (without minimum
volumes attached to these contracts).

In a small number of cases, we also provide solutions to customers active in larger project-oriented
businesses (such as the telecoms or the construction end-markets) where apart from staffing, specific
deliverables also have to be provided. Such engagements may take one week up to two to three months.
We do not have a single major customer from which we generate revenue. The size of this business is also
reduced following the divestment of Gritt Projects.

**_Cost of services_**

Cost of services comprises expenses directly attributable to revenue. These costs mainly include expenses
related to job candidates, such as wages, salaries, and social charges but also include costs associated with
freelancers and subcontractors, referred to as ‘‘insourced costs’’. Cost of services also includes the housing
expenses for foreign and other job candidates referred to as ‘‘services costs’’.

**_Selling expenses_**

Selling expenses comprise personnel and accommodation expenses in relation to operational activities at
the branches, advertising and marketing, and other selling expenses, as well as the amortization and
impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill. Trademarks, licenses and customer
relationship contracts acquired in a business combination have a finite useful life. They are recognized at
fair value at the acquisition date and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
impairment losses. The amortization of customer relationships is based on the projected useful life of the
client (between seven and 12 years).

**_Other general and administrative expenses_**

General and administrative expenses comprise personnel and accommodation expenses of head offices, IT
expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The depreciation expenses component under this
line item largely relates to charges on capitalized buildings, cars and software, among others.

**_Finance income_**

Finance income includes interest income on short-term bank deposits, interest income on loans to related
parties, gains on derecognition of non-convertible bonds, cross-charges to related parties and swaps.

**_Finance expenses_**

Finance expenses include the interest on borrowings from related parties, banks, convertible and
non-convertible bonds, and as of January 1, 2019 the interest charges linked to IFRS16, refinancing costs
and bank fees.

**_Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments_**

Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments is comprised of gains and losses from equity
accounted investments, such as joint ventures.

We had a share of gains and losses from an equity accounted investment in two joint ventures, TEC
Alliance and Zaquensis, which we made in 2016 via our subsidiary Accent Jobs for People NV. Both joint
ventures became subsidiaries as we acquired from the minority shareholders the remaining shares in 2018.
As at September 30, 2020, we had no material interests in joint ventures. However, as at September 30,
2020, we had minority stakes in Happy Recruiter S.A. and Ariad N.V., which do not have a material impact
on our Group.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense is comprised of current tax and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax is recognized in
profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity. The components of and the recognition policies for current tax and deferred tax are set
out below:

_Current tax_

Current tax is comprised of the current tax on profits for the year, as well as adjustments made in respect
of prior years. The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws that are enacted or
substantially enacted at the reporting date in the countries where we operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in our tax returns with regard to situations in which
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the
basis of amounts expected to be paid to the relevant tax authority.

_Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recognized in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or

93


-----

substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related
deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax primarily arises from the valuation of customer relationships and brand names and the
allocation of amortization on them, as well as from fair value adjustments relating to the then existing
senior facilities.

**_Revenue_**

Our revenue decreased by A131.5 million, or 10.2%, from A1,292.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to A1,161.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily as a
result of Covid-19 which led to a decrease in sales by all segments, partially offset by a change in the
reporting at Covebo following the internalization of payroll management in 2020, and growth within
Redmore.

The specialized staffing segment was the largest contributor to Group revenue at 48.8% in the nine months
ended September 30, 2020, with the engineering and consulting segment accounting for 33.5% and the

94

general staffing segment accounting for 17.7% of revenue in the same year. The following table sets out
our revenue split by segment for the periods indicated.

_Engineering and consulting_

Revenue for the engineering and consulting segment decreased by 7.6%, from A420.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 to A389.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020
primarily as a result of the impact of Covid-19 on all brands except Redmore, whose sales increased over
the period.

_Specialized staffing_

Revenue for the specialized staffing segment decreased by 8.7%, from A620.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2019 to A566.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily as a
result of a significant decrease in revenues in the first quarter of 2020 at Accent, which suffered from its
exposure to hospitality and retail (non-food), followed by a rapid recovery from May onwards as the crisis
began to abate somewhat. Covebo sales were also impacted by Covid-19, but to a lesser extent.
Furthermore, the internalization of payroll management in 2020 increased revenues (due to the shifts in
revenue recognition principles under IFRS 15).

_General staffing_

Revenue for the general staffing segment decreased by 18.2%, from A251.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2019 to A205.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily as a
result of both the continued impact from the AUG reform that happened in 2019, reducing our daily sales
and job candidates at work during 2019. This resulted in a lower starting level for the business as at
January 1, 2020. Additionally, the local lockdowns and reduced demand in Germany following Covid-19
also heavily impacted our Aero business, as did continued lower demand in the German automotive sector.

**_Cost of services_**

Our cost of services decreased by 10.0% from A960.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019 to A864.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily as a result of decreases to
payroll costs caused by moving job candidates at work to furlough/temporary unemployment schemes

and 2020 is below.

**_Selling expenses_**

Our selling expenses increased by 1.8% from A154.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019
to A157.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due expenses linked to the
acquisitions of Eurojob, ETA and Techmatch, plus a small increase in depreciation. In Accent, we paid a
one-time additional bonus to members of our commercial team during the second and third quarters, in
recognition of extraordinary continuing contributions during the Covid-19 period.

**_Other general and administrative expenses_**

Our other general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.9% from A86.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2019 to A84.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. As general and
administrative costs are largely fixed in nature, including such costs as rent of corporate headquarters and
costs associated with finance teams, there were reductions in tandem with the adverse environment created
by Covid-19, but the impact was limited.

**_Other gains/(loss) net_**

Our other gains/(loss) net decreased by 43.5% from a gain of A4.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to a gain of A2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due
to the re-estimation of the earn-out payable to the previous shareholders of Techmatch of A1.1 million.

**_Finance income_**

Our finance income decreased by 31.4% from A0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019
to A0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in loans to
related parties, such as certain loans towards Book’u that were converted into capital during the period.

**_Finance expense_**

Our finance expenses increased by 36.1% from A34.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019 to A46.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to increased finance
expenses linked to the refinancing that closed in July 2019, resulting in higher interest charges and
capitalized refinancing fees being depreciated over the lifetime of the Term Loan B Facility loan and the
Senior Secured Notes.

**_Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments_**

Our share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments had no change and remained at nil for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020, as we no longer have any material joint ventures due to the
consolidation of our material joint ventures into our consolidation perimeter in 2018.

**_Income tax expense_**

Our income tax expense decreased by 70.5% from A32.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019 to A9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The effective tax rate for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 was 95.7%, as compared to 53.6% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019. The average annual tax rate in 2020 was highly impacted by the losses for tax purposes
of House of HR NV (mainly resulting from interest expenses of that entity) of A20.3 million for the period,
as compared to A11.4 million for the prior period.

Our revenue increased by A137.1 million, or 8.4%, from A1,623.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 to A1,760.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of growth within
engineering and consulting and specialized staffing.

The specialized staffing segment was the largest contributor to Group revenue at 47.8% in the year ended
December 31, 2019, with the engineering and consulting segment accounting for 33.4% and the general
staffing segment accounting for 18.7% of revenue in the same year. The following table sets out our
revenue split by segment for the periods indicated.

_Engineering and consulting_

Revenue for the engineering and consulting segment increased by 11.2%, from A529.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to A589.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This growth was
primarily the result of growth at Redmore, following the dual impact of selling more expensive profiles as
well as growth in the number of job candidates at work. Abylsen also showed a strong performance, driven
by the automotive sector. This growth was partly offset by a decline in sales in AERO and ibb, following
the AUG and ‘‘equal pay’’ reforms.

_Specialized staffing_

Revenue for the specialized staffing segment increased by 10.7%, from A761.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to A842.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This growth was primarily the
result of growth in Accent driven by the investment in new sales areas and digital initiatives (mainly
NOWJOBS) and increased growth in Covebo following the tight labour market conditions.

_General staffing_

Revenue for the general staffing segment decreased by 1.0%, from A332.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to A329.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily the result
of a change in the regulatory framework with the implementation of the AUG reform, which limits the
assignment period of temporary workers to 18 months. This change went into effect as from September
2018, so 2019 was the first full year impacted by the change.

**_Cost of services_**

Our cost of services increased by 7.8%, from A1,210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to
A1,304.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to more wages,
salaries and social security paid to candidates in line with the organic growth of the Group .Additionally,
depreciation of A15.1 million was taken in 2019, mainly relating to housing facilities that are accounted for
as financial leases as from 2019 and depreciated over their contractual lifetime.

A comparison of the components of our cost services for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 is
below.

**_Selling expenses_**

Our selling expenses increased by 18.8%, from A189.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to
A225.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to increased depreciation,
mainly resulting from increased depreciation charges on the acquisition-related intangible assets and from
the impact of the IFRS16 lease standard resulting in the movement of substantially all leases onto the
balance sheet. The impact of the IFRS16 lease standard on the depreciation charges is partly offset by a
decrease in the services rent of the same leases (for cars and buildings). In addition, wages and salaries
paid to branch personnel increased from A94.9 million in 2018 to A105.7 million in 2019.

**_Other general and administrative expenses_**

Our other general and administrative expenses increased by 5.4%, from A115.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to A121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily
due to higher wages, salaries and social security paid to personnel in 2019 as a result of investment in
back-office operations for future growth, partly offset by lower share based payments linked to share based
payments provisions (which declined from approximately A14 million in 2018 to A4.6 million in 2019).Other
gains/(loss) net

Our other gains/(loss) net decreased by 98.6%, from a gain of A34.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to a gain of A0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the
one-time revaluation of shares in 2018 resulting from our acquisition of control over the TEC Group and
Zaquensis Group, for which we remeasured the previously held interest at fair value and recognized the
resultant gain in profit for an amount of A24.3 million. Additionally, a provision of A6.6 million was

reversed during 2018 when it was decided to transfer the ratchet payable to Abylsen from the Group to
Group shareholders.

**_Finance income_**

Our finance income increased by 273.2%, from A1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to
A3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a positive fair value adjustment on
derivatives of A3.5 million in 2019.

**_Finance expense_**

Our finance expenses increased by 29.2%, from A32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to
A42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to higher interest expense on
bank borrowings as a result of costs to obtain the bank loans for the Senior Facilities Agreement and
additional costs associated with our 2019 refinancing.

**_Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments_**

Our share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments was nil for the year ended December 31, 2018
compared to A0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as we no longer have any material joint
ventures due to the consolidation of our material joint ventures into our consolidation perimeter in 2018.

**_Income tax expense_**

Our income tax expense increased by 18.5%, from A31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to
A37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate for 2019 amounted to
approximately 52%, as compared to approximately 28% for 2018. The effective tax rate is significantly
impacted by gains on the determination of the fair value of previously acquired interests and the
re-measurement of deferred taxes resulting from a change in domestic tax rates, both recorded in 2018; the
share-based payment plan expenses, for which the 2018 amount significantly exceeds the 2019 amount; and
the unrecognized deferred income tax losses, which significantly impacted the 2019 result as a result of the
roll-over and refinancing done in 2019.

**_Revenue_**

Our revenue increased by A507.1 million, or 45.4%, from A1,116.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 to A1,623.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of strong growth in the
engineering and consulting, and specialized staffing segments as a result of key acquisitions and Organic
Growth of 12.3%.

The specialized staffing segment was the largest contributor to Group revenue at 46.9% in the year ended
December 31, 2018, with the engineering and consulting segment accounting for 32.6% and the general
staffing segment accounting for 20.5% of revenue in the same year. The following table sets out our

December 31, 2018.

_Engineering and consulting_

Revenue for the engineering and consulting segment increased by 142.9%, from A218.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to A529.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This growth was
primarily the result of acquisitions, including the full year impact in 2018 of the Redmore acquisition at the
end of 2017, our acquisition of control over TEC Alliance in early 2018 and various bolt-on acquisitions
that occurred in 2018. Our Organic Growth for this segment was 19.1%, predominantly due to increased
investments by Abylsen and Continu through hiring additional in-house employees in sales and recruiting,
respectively, who were able to source new job candidates and clients.

_Specialized staffing_

Revenue for the specialized staffing segment increased by 16.4%, from A654.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to A761.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This growth was primarily the
result of Organic Growth of 14.5% predominantly due to Accent’s expansion of its branch network and
further specialization and Covebo’s expansion of its international recruiting network, each of which
resulted in additional job candidates being placed on assignments with clients.

_General staffing_

Revenue for the general staffing segment increased by 36.1%, from A244.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to A332.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This growth was primarily the
result of bringing Zaquensis into our financial consolidation perimeter in 2018 following our additional
acquisition of its shares during 2018 and the acquisition of Mach at the end of 2017 and Weiderer at the
beginning of 2018 by TimePartner. Organic Growth, however, only increased by 2.1% during this period
primarily due to the impact of the AUG reform (which led to clients hiring our jobs candidates or ending[¨]
their temporary staffing assignments in Germany sooner than expected), reduced activity in the automotive
industry, the Rhine drought (which led to factory shutdowns in the Rhine industrial area due to supply
shortages), and the closing of 11 loss-making branches at Zaquensis.

**_Cost of services_**

Our cost of services increased by 43.9%, from A840.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to
A1,210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in
wages and salaries, and social security costs in line with organic and inorganic growth in our Group, as well
as a significant increase in insourcing costs from freelancers within the Group as a result of the
consolidation of TEC, which was previously accounted for as a joint venture, into our consolidation

perimeter in 2018 and which utilizes a large amount of freelancers. Furthermore, the full-year impact in
2018 of the acquisition of Redmore, which was acquired near the end of 2017 and which also utilizes a
large amount of freelancers, further increased our insourced cost component in 2018.

A comparison of the components of our cost services for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 is

**_Selling expenses_**

Our selling expenses increased by 61.0%, from A117.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
A189.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily due to an increase in wages and
salaries of our branch personnel and social security cost increases resulting from both organic and
acquisition growth in the Group, including increases in variable pay connected to incentive schemes for our
business units, as well as significant increases in expenses from the amortization of customer relationships
and brand names due to the significant amount of acquisitions that occurred in 2018 or late in 2017, but
which had a full year impact in 2018.

**_Other general and administrative expenses_**

Our other general and administrative expenses decreased by 12.1%, from A131.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to A115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily
due to decreases in share-based payments following significant and exceptional, non-recurring share-based
payments made in 2017 in preparation for the 2018 legal reorganization to settle our share option plan and
ratchet schemes, partially offset by increases in wages and salaries at the Group headquarters as well as
consultancy, accounting and legal expenses in 2018 in the context of the 2018 legal reorganization, the
transition to IFRS 16 and in preparation for the refinancing and related transactions effected in
connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes and the incurrence of the Senior Facilities.

**_Other gains/(loss) net_**

Our other gains/(loss) net increased by 280.3%, from a gain of A9.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to a gain of A34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the
remeasurement of the fair value of TEC Alliance and Zaquensis, over which we acquired full control in
2018 and which accounted for A24.3 million of other gains.

**_Finance income_**

Our finance income decreased by 74.4%, from A3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
A1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a significant decrease in interest
income on loans to related parties due to the movement of TEC Alliance and Zaquensis from jointventures into the consolidation perimeter of the Group in 2018.

**_Finance expense_**

Our finance expenses increased by 9.6%, from A29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
A32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily due to a significant increase in
interest expense on bank borrowings. However, our finance expenses in 2017 were impacted by refinancing
costs and bank fees upon the extinguishment of the 2016 senior facilities agreement, which had been
deducted from our borrowings on our balance sheet and then amortized over the term of the loan.

**_Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments_**

Our share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments was A1.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the
elimination of the carrying amounts for TEC Alliance and Zaquensis due to the reorganization of the
Group’s share capital as part of the 2018 legal reorganization.

**_Income tax expense_**

Our income tax expense decreased by 31.7%, from A46.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
A31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily due to a tax matter brought against
us by the Belgian authorities and an associated settlement in 2017, as well as a decrease in deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities as a result of the smaller number of acquisitions that occurred in 2018 as
compared to 2017 that resulted in deferred tax liabilities in relation to the valuation of trade names and
customer relationships, among others.

**Cash flows**

The following table presents primary components of our cash flow for the periods indicated.

**For the nine**
**For the year ended** **months ended**
**December 31,** **September 30,**
**2017** **2018** **2019** **2019** **2020**

Net cash flow from financing activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 173.7 36.5 (27.8) 255.6 (71.0)

**_Net cash flow from operating activities_**

Net cash flow from operating activities recorded a cash inflow of A91.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, compared with a cash inflow of A143.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020. This was impacted by the countercyclical nature of the business in a crisis, whereby
less working capital needs remain in accounts receivable and social liabilities; and non-recourse
commercial finance launched in Germany in 2020 and impacted by government support following
Covid-19, which still needs to be repaid (a grant in the Netherlands issued in favor of NOWJOBS that
could be claimed, although it was not certain yet whether the criteria could be met).

Net cash flow from operating activities recorded a cash inflow of A115.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, compared with a cash inflow of A107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
This change was principally due to the growth of the Group

Net cash flow from operating activities recorded a cash inflow of A29.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, compared with a cash inflow of A107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
This change was principally due to the net profit of the period in 2018 compared to the net loss in 2017, as
well as a misclassification of repayment of bank debt of approximately A28.6 million associated with the
purchase of Redmore, partially offset by the share based payments of A59.7 million in 2018.

**_Net cash flow from investing activities_**

Net cash flow from investing activities amounted to a net cash outflow of A27.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2019, compared with a cash outflow of A23.9 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020. This change was principally due to reduced capital expenditures following Covid-19,
which resulted in lower expenses linked to the current and further expansion of the branch network, while
IT capital expenditure was maintained at normal levels.

Net cash flow from investing activities amounted to a net cash outflow of A121.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, compared with a net cash outflow of A59.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. The primary reasons for cash outflow in the year ended December 31, 2019 were due to various
acquisitions that took place in 2019, amounting to an outflow of A38.7 million (net of cash acquired), which
comprised a less material amount of M&A as compared to 2018.

Net cash flow from investing activities amounted to a net cash outflow of A173.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, compared with a net cash outflow of A121.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2018. The primary reasons for cash outflow in the year ended December 31, 2018 were due to various
bolt-on acquisitions in 2018 and the roll-over of TEC Alliance and Zaquensis into the Group consolidation
perimeter in 2018. The primary reasons for cash outflow in the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to
the acquisitions of Effect, Mach, Vialegis and Redmore.

**_Net cash flow from financing activities_**

Net cash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of A255.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2019, compared with a cash outflow of A71.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 primarily due to the refinancing in July 2019, which resulted in a cash inflow from the
Term Loan B Facility drawing and Senior Secured Notes issuance, which were used to refinance existing
debt and to finance a capital decrease that was carried out in October 2019.

Net cash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of A36.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 from a cash outflow of A27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cash
outflow in 2019 was linked to the repayment of A600 million of borrowings via the new financing of
A370 million in Senior Secured Notes and A550 million under the Term Loan B Facility, of which
A287.4 million was used for a capital reduction. The cashflow was also impacted by increased interest and
refinancing expenses, as well as A33.8 million in principal elements of lease payments.

Net cash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of A173.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to a cash inflow of A36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, principally due
to lower proceeds from borrowings in 2018 as compared to proceeds from borrowings in 2017, when a
refinancing occurred and was drawn in an amount of A475 million in 2017, as compared to A125 million in
2018. The roll-over that occurred in 2018 also impacted the net cash flow from financing activities for 2018
due to shares being purchased from minority shareholders.

**Working Capital**

Working capital changes amounted to A3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019,
compared to A53.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the
countercyclical nature of the business in a crisis, whereby less working capital needs remain in accounts
receivable and social liabilities; and non-recourse commercial finance launched in Germany in 2020 and
impacted by government support following Covid-19 which still needs to be repaid (a grant in the
Netherlands issued in favor of NOWJOBS that could be claimed, although it was not certain yet whether
the criteria would be met). Working capital changes amounted to negative A17.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 compared to negative A18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily
due to an increase in commercial finance in Accent, which offset an ordinary course increase in working
capital needs following the growth of the Group.

Working capital changes amounted to negative A48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017
compared to negative A17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a surplus in
accounts receivable in 2018 compared to a negative accounts receivable in 2017, as well as higher accounts
payable due to a A28.6 million repayment of external bank debt misclassified to accounts payable related to
the acquisition of Redmore and higher payroll & social debt in 2017 due to acquisitions and Organic
Growth in our Group, offset by higher other debt in 2018 due to debt resulting from the ratchet schemes
and our share option plan.

_Invoicing_

In order to minimize the credit risk of the Group, we follow practices in relation to the issuance and timing
of invoices to customers.

In the specialized staffing segment, invoicing is typically done on a weekly basis to customers, with payment
terms ranging from zero up to 60 days, but with a majority on a 30 day payment term. Customers with no
credit history or very small customers receive a zero or seven day credit, allowing us to closely monitor
payment behavior, and to withhold rendering services (i.e. people at work) if a payment is not made when
due.

103


-----

In the engineering & consulting segment, customers are on average typically somewhat larger SMEs or are
large companies such as financial, transportation or industrial firms. In this segment, invoicing cycles are
most often on a monthly basis, with payment terms between 30 to 60 days, or in France, up to 90 days.

It should be noted that the company has a credit insurance policy in place covering all Group entities, up to
a limit of A150 million.

**Capital Expenditures**

Our capital expenditures represent expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and
intangibles, primarily related to furniture and infrastructure for our branch network, accommodation for
foreign job candidates, cars (purchased by the TimePartner business unit) and IT investments undertaken
by the Group.

(3) On June 28, 2019, we entered into a commercial finance agreement for A50.0 million with an indefinite term upon the expiry of
our prior commercial finance. In connection with this non-recourse commercial finance agreement the factor assumed the
payment risk and credit under the factoring agreement. As a result, this commercial finance agreement has been accounted for
as non-recourse.

(4) Reflects IAS 17, but does not reflect IFRS 16 (Leases).

**Off-Balance Sheet Obligations**

We have been party to factoring arrangements during the period under review. The carrying amounts of
trade receivables, which amounted to A25.0 million as per December 31, 2017, included receivables which
were subject to factoring arrangements. Under these arrangements, we transferred the relevant receivables
to the factor in exchange for cash and were prevented from selling or pledging the receivables. However,
under these arrangements we retained late payment risk and credit risk. We therefore continued to
recognize the transferred assets on our balance sheet. We consider the held to collect business model to
remain appropriate for these receivables and hence continue measuring these receivables at amortized
cost.

In 2018 we signed a new commercial finance agreement of A50.0 million and sold A49.2 million receivables
from our Accent and TEC business units for cash, which related to client invoiced receivables. Unlike the
factoring arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, the factor
assumed the payment risk and credit under the factoring agreement. As a result, this agreement from
January 1, 2019 has been accounted for as a non-recourse agreement. As a result, A49.2 million has been
deducted from consolidated open trade receivables as per December 31, 2018.

On June 28, 2019, we renewed the 2018 commercial finance agreement for A50.0 million. The agreement
has no expiration date and is non-recourse but is otherwise largely in line with the prior terms. In April
2020 we expanded our commercial finance agreement into Germany. The contract allows us to increase
commercial finance up to the maximum liability amount, which is A150 million, by adding more entities in
the perimeter next to the current Belgian and German entities in scope.

With the exception of the above, we have not engaged in any material off-balance sheet financing
arrangements during the periods under review.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk**

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk), credit risk
and liquidity risk. Our overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial
markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance.

Our risk management is carried out by our compliance department and treasury team in accordance with
principles provided by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors provides principles for overall risk
management, as well as policies covering specific areas. The Group’s treasury team identifies, evaluates
and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with our business units. Derivative financial instruments are
used to hedge certain risk exposures.

**_Market Risk_**

_Foreign exchange risk_

Our exposure to foreign exchange risk is very limited as our operations are essentially denominated in
euro. Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of these currencies of +/-10% is considered as immaterial.

_Interest rate risk_

Our interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose our
cash flow to an interest rate risk which is offset by the interest rate caps.

Interest rate caps were in place cover 50% of the long-term bank borrowings at year-end 2018 of the
variable loan principal outstanding. These caps have been terminated and cancelled with effect as from
July 12, 2019, following the refinancing that took place in July 2019. No new hedging instruments were set
up to cover any potential interest rate risk.

As at December 31, 2018, we had a nominal amount of A600 million of outstanding bank loans, structured
as a bullet loan under the then existing senior facilities. Following the refinancing in July 2019, the nominal
amount of outstanding bank loans changed to A550 million, structured in the same way as a bullet loan
under the Senior Facility Agreement. Once per year, excess cash flow is calculated based on final audited
accounts which serve to determine whether a mandatory prepayment should take place under this
agreement. So far, no mandatory prepayments have taken place. These loans are floating rate borrowings,
with interest based on Euribor floored to zero plus a fixed margin of 4.25% if leverage is greater than or
equal to 3.25x.

105


-----

For the applicable reporting periods, these floating rate borrowings are entirely accounted for at amortized
cost, and therefore the impact of changes in the market interest rate on the fair value of these floating rate
borrowings at the closing date will have no impact on the income statement or on the equity. We do not
apply hedge accounting.

Euribor floating rate borrowings which are not covered by the swaps are subject to interest rate risk. An
increase (decrease) of 100 basis points in interest rate as per year-end would have an effect on profit after
tax and equity as follows:

**December 31,**
**2017** **2018** **2019**

Increase 100 bps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (130,000) (3,599,000) (5,500,000)
Decrease 100 bps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0* 0* 0*

- A decrease of the Euribor interest rate has no impact, as the Euribor has a floor of 0%, with a negative Euribor throughout the
different reporting periods.

For additional information see ‘‘—Annual Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4: Financial risk
_management—4.1 Financial risk factors—Interest rate risk’’._

**_Credit risk_**

Our credit risk mainly arises from credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables, as well
as from cash and cash equivalents, favorable derivative financial instruments, and deposits with banks and
financial institutions.

_Risk management_

We have no significant concentrations of credit risk other than that for ordinary debtors. We have policies
to ensure that the services are provided to customers with an appropriate credit history. Credit risk is
managed locally by each subgroup (brand) and certain companies have credit insurance in place.

The credit quality of customers, considering the financial position of customers, past experience and other
factors, is closely assessed by the credit department on a regular basis. Individual risk limits are set based
on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the finance committee. The utilization of
credit limits is regularly monitored. Credit insurance is in place with Accent (including Logi-Technic),
TimePartner, Zaquensis and Covebo, in each case covering 90% of the face value of their respective
receivables, with the remaining 10% of receivables of Accent (including Logi-Technic) (up to A50.0 million)
covered by the agent under the new commercial finance agreement described above.

No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does not expect any losses
from non-performance by these counterparties.

_Impairment of financial assets_

We have three types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model:

- trade receivables for sales of services;

- contract assets resulting from project services in progress; and

- debt investments carried at amortized cost.

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was no
identified impairment loss.

_Trade receivables_

We apply the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected
loss allowance for all trade receivables.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on
shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before each
reporting year-end, and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The

106


-----

historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macro-economic
factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

Trade receivables and project related receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of
recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure
of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with us, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period
of greater than 120 days past due. Several factors are considered in assessing the likelihood of impairment
which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within
operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same
line item.

We first apply the policy relating to impairment of the trade receivables under the incurred loss model, and
then, for the rest of receivables which are not provided for, we apply the expected credit loss model, and
recognize an additional provision. As at December 31, 2019, 67% of our trade receivables were less than
one month old, 19% were between one month and two months old and the remaining 14% were between
two months and two years old. As at December 31, 2019, 98% of the trade receivables were not impaired,
while 2% were impaired.

As at December 31, 2019, trade receivables of A56.9 million (December 31, 2018: A63.0 million,
December 31, 2017: A65.4 million) were past due but not impaired. These receivables are expected to be
recovered and have not been provided for because they relate to well-known customers and they are
strictly followed up by the credit department. The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:

**As at December 31,**
**Receivables past due but not provided for:** **2017** **2018** **2019**
**(E in millions)**
Less than 1 month . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 51.0 45.5 41.4

As at December 31, 2019, trade receivables (including VAT) of A5.6 million (December 31, 2018:
A3.8 million, December 31, 2017: A3.1 million) were impaired and provided for.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and use of trade supplier credit terms.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by the Group
treasury. Group treasury monitors rolling forecasts of our liquidity requirements to ensure we have
sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on our undrawn
committed borrowing facilities at all times so that we do not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where
applicable) on any of our borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration our debt financing
plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets and, if applicable,
external regulatory or legal requirements. We also use factoring agreements with certain banks in order to
obtain early access to cash flows.

**_Capital risk management_**

Our objectives when managing capital are to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern in order
to provide returns for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure
to reduce the cost of capital.

Consistent with others in the industry, we monitor capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is
calculated as net debts divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including
‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the statement of financial position) less cash and cash
equivalents. Total capital is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the statement of financial position plus net
debts.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW**

**Overview of the Staffing Solutions Industry**

We are a diversified human resources solutions provider serving clients located primarily in Belgium,
France, Germany and the Netherlands through nine business units. We operate through three distinct
segments: Engineering and Consulting; Specialized Staffing and General Staffing. Our Engineering and
Consulting segment is focused on supplying clients with high-skilled white collar consultants and mid to
high-skilled professionals to meet clients’ specialized needs in a variety of end-markets including financial,
industrial and construction end-markets. Through this segment, we also staff one to three-year
construction projects, mainly through secondment or time and materials contracts. Our Specialized
Staffing segment typically supplies a small number of high demand mid-skilled blue-collar and white collars
workers to clients for specialized positions on a temporary basis. We source our candidates both from our
primary markets and also increasingly from our international recruitment network. Finally, our general
staffing segment focuses on a wide range of end-markets in Germany, by providing clients with lowerskilled blue-collar workers in roles that are experiencing significant labor shortages, enabling our clients to
benefit from labor flexibility to match demand in the event of market fluctuations. Across all three
segments, in addition to the positive secular trends supporting the whole staffing solutions industry, the
diversity of our clients’ end-markets and geographic markets supports our business resiliency and outlook.

Staffing solutions providers fall into one of three categories: mono-specialists, multi-specialists and
generalists. A specialty in this sense is a combination of at least two out of three types of expertise:
(i) functional expertise, or a focus on a specific skill level or specific job functions (such as lawyers,
engineers, low-skilled blue collar workers); (ii) industrial expertise, a focus on a specific end-market (such
as food production or construction); and (iii) local expertise, a focus on a given region or city. Mono- and
multi-specialists (which only differ from each other through depending on the number of specialties they
serve) provide a focus on a given specialty with a dedicated sales force, specific processes and tailored
value proposition focused typically on smaller volumes per client and a possible focus on a specific client
size. Generalists, on the other hand serve a broad range of activities, clients, contract sizes and contract
types with generalist sales forces, similar processes and offer less tailored solutions to a wide range of
clients.

**Staffing Solutions Industry Size and Outlook**

The total market size for the staffing market in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium was approximately
A47 billion in revenue in 2017; the consulting market in Benelux and France was approximately A18 billion
in revenue; and the engineering staffing market in Belgium and the Netherlands was approximately
A18 billion in revenue, In total, the market size was estimated at A83 billion in revenue (the ‘‘Total
**Market’’) in 2017. These 4 key geographic markets are characterized by high average salaries, low**
unemployment and a high demand for scarcity-driven profiles and are well developed and mature in the
temporary staffing and consulting fields. As a result of these trends, the number of temporary workers in
these markets has increased significantly over the last decade. Between 2013 and 2017, each of the markets
captured in the Total Market definition experienced consistent growth of approximately 3 to 5% each year.

Our Total Market reflects the type of staffing markets for which we provide services and in our primary
geographies on a country basis, but it does not reflect the narrower type of job candidates that many of our
business units recruit and supply to clients or the specific end-market niches on which they concentrate.
That more limited market is reflected below in our Addressable Market (as defined below).

-----

The Total Market and its historical growth from 2013 to 2017 is presented below.


2013 2017 """ 12DEC202001040410

As shown above, the staffing, consulting and engineering markets in the countries in which we operate
were expected to grow at a rate of 4% per annum to a total of A104 billion in aggregate revenue by 2023 in
the absence of a downturn in the broader economy. We believe that such growth is to be expected in the
future, although with a 1-3 year delay due to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis (see below), driven by
long-term structural changes in the employment market of each of our core geographic markets as well as
a regulatory environment that allows for flexible staffing services.

**Impact of the Covid-19 Crisis on Our Key Markets and the Short-Term Outlook**

The Covid-19 crisis has severely impacted the economy across all our key markets. According to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), as of October 2020, the 2020 real gross domestic product (real GDP)
in our 4 key markets is expected to go down by 8.3% in Belgium, 9.8% in France, 6.0% in Germany and
5.4% in the Netherlands.

Along with most of the other industries, the staffing industry was strongly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.
The lockdown measures and business restrictions have led to a significant reduction in clients’ activities
across our key markets, delaying or cancelling their needs for temporary workers, especially during the
lockdowns in the second quarter of 2020.

In order to mitigate the impact of such measures, governments in these markets have put in place
significant government sponsored programs in order to help companies preserve their workforce and their
liquidity. Next to several measures to postpone VAT, corporate and withholding tax payments and social
security, the different countries introduced schemes to allow companies to keep people employed. In
Belgium, a temporary unemployment scheme was introduced, to allow people to continue to earn up to
70% of their salary (maximum of around A2,000 a month), without any additional cost to the company,
except for the holiday pay (for which the government is still working out if it will also support the holiday
pay for that period). This scheme existed between March and September 2020, and then was reintroduced
October 2020, during the second lockdown, planned to end on March 31, 2021. In France, a similar scheme
was introduced, but with a small cost remaining with the company. From March to May 2020 this cost was
10% of the employee’s salary, increased to 15% of the employee’s salary from June 2020 through March
2021. The German measure of Kurzarbeit is also a full temporary unemployment scheme in line with the
Belgian scheme, which has now been prolonged until December 31, 2021. In the Netherlands the
government provides for a government grant to support staffing costs, provided the company lost over 20%
of its turnover in the comparable period in 2019. This was called the NOW grants. While House of HR
used the schemes in France, Belgium and Germany, in the Netherlands, House of HR applied and
received the grants, but will be required to pay them back, given the turnover decrease did not reach 20%
for most entities. Therefore the grants received have remained on the balance sheet. The table below

Governments in each of our key markets are expecting an economic rebound, especially assuming the
availability of an effective vaccine in 2021. As such, in 2021, Belgium real GDP is expected to grow by
5.4%, France real GDP by 6.0%, Germany real GDP by 4.2% and the Netherlands real GDP by 4.0%,
according to IMF analyses from October 2020 (see table below).

With regard to the staffing industry, recovery periods after a crisis usually favor temporary work and
outsourcing as companies look to start scaling up their workforce while limiting the weight on their cost
base. It is especially true in countries such as the key markets in which we operate in which the permanent
workers are more protected, limiting companies’ flexibility.

According to Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA—Global Staffing Industry Market Estimates and Forecast,
November 2020, https://staffingindustry.com/), a global advisor on staffing and workforce solutions, the
staffing market is expected to rebound in 2021, driven by a partial recovery post the Covid-19 crisis, which
severely impacted the market in 2020. The table below shows SIA estimates of the expected year-on-year
change in staffing revenue in 2020 and 2021 for each of our key markets.

As shown in the graph above, the staffing market in Belgium suffered severely from the lockdown
measures that were enforced in the country notably during the first lockdown in March 2020. As such, the
number of hours worked daily by temporary agency workers in Belgium declined by 44% in April 2020
compared to the same period last year. This decline was the combination of a decrease in both segments:
the number of hours worked in the blue-collar worker sector fell by 47%, and by 41% in the white-collar
sector.

However, since the lifting of the lockdown restrictions which started gradually in May 2020, the number of
hours worked daily by temporary agency workers in Belgium has gradually recovered and narrowed the
gap with 2019 levels. As such, the decline in the number of hours worked daily by temporary agency
workers in Belgium in October 2020 was narrowed to 8.2%, resulting from a decline of 10.1% in the
blue-collar worker sector and a decline of 5.4% in the white-collar sector versus 2019 levels. This 8.2%
decline in October 2020 is also an improvement over September’s decrease of 11.8% and signals a
continual recovery of temporary agency work in Belgium and will also set the starting point for the
2021 hours. This monthly increase was attributable to a growth of 4.0% in the number of hours worked
daily by temporary agency workers in the blue-collar segment and an increase in the number of hours
worked daily by temporary agency workers in the white-collar segment of 2.8% in October 2020.

According to The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the shock of the second national lockdown is
expected to be less severe, as restrictions are less stringent than during the first, but the pick-up in activity
will be subdued as demand will remain weak. Private consumption and investment should boost the
recovery in the later part of 2021; with EIU forecasting that they will expand by 6.7% and 7% respectively
in full-year 2021.

In terms of broader trends, weak productivity growth (notably in the services sector) and a relatively low
labor participation rate, especially among older age groups, will also constrain real GDP growth, according
to the EIU. The challenges facing the Belgian labor market are likely to persist. There remains a risk that,
once the worst of the crisis is over, there will still be a long recovery ahead because of skills bottlenecks in
some sectors (especially in the digital field), and labor market scarring. This is a broader trend which could
favor the staffing market. According to SIA (Global Staffing Industry Market Estimates and Forecast,
November 5, 2020), Belgium staffing revenue is expected to increase by 5% in 2021.

Although we are not really active in the ‘pure’ staffing segment in France, but mostly in the engineering
and consulting segment, the broader staffing market evolution of 2020 gives some insights into the impact
of the Covid-19 crisis on all forms of temporary staffing and consulting solutions. The below graph, based
on data from Prism’Emploi, the French association of employment agencies illustrates monthly growth
evolution (compared to the same month last year) of the number of hours worked by temporary agency
workers in France starting January 2020.

As shown in the graph above, the staffing market in France suffered dramatically from the lockdown
restrictions that were announced on March 12, 2020 by French president Emmanuel Macron. The number
of hours worked by temporary agency workers in France declined by 47% in May 2020 when compared to
the same period last year, with a decline in demand for temporary workers across all staffing segments. As
of October 2020, temporary employment in France since January 2020 has witnessed a reduction of 26%
vs. January to October 2019.

However, since the lifting of the lockdown restrictions starting on May 11, 2020, the number of hours
worked by temporary agency workers in France has continuously increased and reduced the gap to 2019
levels. The total amount of hours worked by temporary workers in France fell by 10.3% in October 2020

when compared to October 2019. October’s 10.3% decline in activity was an improvement over the
previous month’s 16.1% year-on-year decline. This data did not however include the impact of France’s
second lockdown, which began at the end of October 2020, but is expected to have a lesser impact given
the limitations in the restrictions compared to those imposed in the second quarter of 2020.

Temporary employment in October 2020 increased in transport (+15%), but decreased in trade (�6%),
industry (�15%), construction (�16%) and services (�16%). All qualifications saw a decrease in
temporary employment in October. Temporary employment fell among employees (�2%), unskilled
workers (�9%), skilled workers (�14%) and managers and intermediate professions (�15%). This was
an improvement compared to May 2020, when temporary employment in all sectors declined compared to
the same period in May 2019, including transport (�26%), trade (�44%), industry (�48%), services
(�54%) and BTP (�61%).

Even after the significant rebound in the third quarter of 2020, economic activity in France remains below
pre-crisis levels and the fragile recovery faces headwinds from the pandemic’s second wave. Output is
expected to decline by around 10 percent for 2020 as a whole, with the better-than-expected third quarter
offset by a contraction in the fourth quarter, according to the IMF. For 2021, the IMF anticipates a partial
recovery of 6%, but this will depend upon the evolution of the pandemic and related containment
measures. According to SIA (Global Staffing Industry Market Estimates and Forecast, November 2020),
France staffing market revenue is expected to rebound strongly with an expected increase of 18% in 2021.

France as of the third quarter of 2020:

**_Germany_**

The staffing market in Germany suffered from the lockdown restrictions that were introduced in the
country on March 2020. Statistik der Bundesagentur f¨ur Arbeit (the Statistical Office of the Federal
Employment Agency) estimates that the demand for workers was reduced by more than half in the month
of April 2020.

Since the lifting of the restrictions, the number of job registrations has then consistently increased.
According to Statistik der Bundesagentur f¨ur Arbeit, 990,000 jobs were newly registered from April to
November, a 29% decline compared to the same period in 2019. 40% of this decrease is due to temporary
work. According to SIA (Staffing Industry Report Webinar: Global Staffing Market Forecasts, November
2020) the number of agency jobs year-to-date was down by 13% as of the third quarter of 2020.

Though Germany has been relatively effective in managing the pandemic thus far, the country’s sizeable
manufacturing sector is highly export oriented and exposed to both supply chain disruption and sinking
global demand. While market conditions and staffing market activity levels improved in the third quarter,
the rate of growth is slowing in the fourth quarter with listed staffing firms remaining cautious on the
German market in the near term, according to SIA (Global Staffing Industry Market Estimates and
Forecast, November 2020). New public health restrictions beginning in early November may further
undermine business confidence and the staffing recovery, especially in the hospitality industry.

According to the EIU, the German economy is expected to return to its end-2019 size by 2022 (in real
GDP terms), ahead of the EU average of 2023, with a real GDP growth estimate of 4.6% in 2021 (4.2% for
IMF). German staffing revenue is also expected to recover with an expected increase of 13% in 2021,
according to SIA (Global Staffing Industry Market Estimates and Forecast, November 2020).

**_The Netherlands_**

The below graph, based on data from ABU, the Dutch Federation of Private Employment Agencies,
illustrates the evolution of the total amount of hours worked by temporary workers in the Netherlands
starting January 2020, compared to the same period last year.

_Note: 2020’01 refers to the period (weeks 1-4) of 2020_

As shown in the graph above, the staffing market in the Netherlands suffered from the lockdown measures
that were introduced in the country on March 13, 2020. The number of hours worked by temporary agency
workers in the Netherlands declined by 24% in the fourth period (March 23 through April 19) of 2020,
when compared to the same period last year. This decrease is a combination of a 24% decrease in the
administration sector, a 21% decrease in the number of hours worked by temporary workers in the
industrial sector and a 16% decrease in the technical sector.

In the administration sector, hours worked decreased by 24% and revenue decreased by 15% compared to
the same period last year. In the industrial sector, the number of hours decreased by 21% and revenue
decreased by 16% compared to the same period last year. In the technical sector, hours decreased by 36%
and revenue decreased by 28% compared to the same period last year.

Following the loosening in restrictions in May 2020, the staffing industry in the Netherlands began
recovering from June onwards and gradually narrowed the gap with 2019 levels. The total amount of hours
worked by temporary workers in the Netherlands decreased by 7% in the eleventh period (weeks 41-44,
ended November 1) of 2020, compared to the same period last year. This decrease is a combination of a
4% decrease in the number of hours worked by temporary workers in the industrial sector, a 7% decrease
in the administration sector and a 28% decrease in the technical sector.

With regard to the short-term outlook, according to the IMF, the Netherlands real GDP is expected to
increase by 4.0% in 2021. According to SIA (Global Staffing Industry Market Estimates and Forecast,
November 2020), the staffing revenue in the Netherlands is also expected to recover with an expected
growth rate of 3% in 2021 in an increasingly cautious labor market with a potential deterioration in the
manufacturing segment and a growth above 4% in the IT industry.

The below table summarizes the key measures in the Netherlands as of the third quarter of 2020:

**Staffing Solutions Secular Industry Drivers**

Demand for the types of solutions we provide has increased and is expected to continue growing in the
future, once markets have recovered from the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, due to a number of positive
secular trends:

_Ageing populations._ As the population of our target markets ages and workers exit the labor pool, there
has been an increase in competition among employers to fill the gaps left behind. This has left an opening
for staffing intermediaries, especially those like our Group that have a proven track record of identifying
and matching the right candidates to the right jobs, to fill these vacant positions with qualified talent.
Additionally, a scarcity of talent for certain roles is driving wages up, which in turn can increase the pricing
power of staffing firms for the solutions and staffing we provide. See ‘‘—Skilled labor shortages’’ below for
_further information._

_Technological changes._ In recent years, candidates are increasingly turning to online job boards when
seeking out a position, particularly through traffic generated by mobile devices. At the same time, clients
expect more efficient services at a lower cost that can only be delivered through the use of digital tools. We
have also seen an increase in the number of passive job seekers who apply through targeted advertisements
on social media when they were not actively searching for a position at the time. The market has also
experienced the development of new platforms, such as Uber Works in the United States, which however
announced in May 2020 the closure of their operations in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to
their official press release. Such platforms may be considered competitors, since they sometimes are able
to attract people directly to be employed for them via freelance or independent status. Nevertheless, such
platforms lack a human touch in the services they provide, and authorities in different countries monitor
fair treatment of workers by these platforms and are looking to ensure that there is no unfair competition

with other forms of labor. Such monitoring is especially common in the EU, where regulation and labor
unions are stronger than in other countries.

_Career mobility and the need to re-skill._ Millennial workers, especially highly skilled ones, are increasingly
mobile and seeking a varied career path, driving the need for re-skilling. This re-skilling can be provided
through both formal and on-the-job training that is typically provided as part of temporary work
agreements.

_Diversity, inclusion and corporate social responsibility._ As the diversity trend becomes mainstream across
clients, service providers have an opportunity to provide increasing value to their clients by tapping into
broad, international pools of candidates.

_Increased premium on quality of life._ It is increasingly difficult to find qualified candidates to fill some
roles that offer long hours and difficult conditions, as younger generations of workers are placing a fairly
large premium on happiness in their personal and professional lives. This has contributed to a supply and
demand gap in certain end-markets and as a result, staffing solutions providers with the ability to source
and place candidates successfully, are in greater demand.

_Outsourcing and offshoring._ Financial pressures on companies, especially the small- to medium-sized
enterprises (‘‘SMEs’’), have incentivized them to outsource many of their non-core functions. Further, due
to accelerated business rhythms, companies are increasingly looking to obtain immediately available
resources. This has led to an increased need for temporary staffing and outsourced support that can be
provided rapidly on short notice.

_Favorable European and local regulatory environment._ Current trends in the way both the European Union
and individual countries approach the regulation of employment are favorable to fostering temporary
work, as regulations tend to reinforce the protection of permanent workers, leading companies to be
increasingly cautious in their permanent hiring. Although a regulatory change in Germany had the effect of
curbing the volumes of staffing toward 2018, customers and staffing companies have adapted to the new
regulatory framework despite the uncertainty that the regulatory change generated in the market. As a
result of this uncertainty, staffing companies that are flexible both in their sourcing of candidates and their
ability to rotate workers into other companies will benefit from pricing opportunities. Furthermore, HR
staffing solutions also operate in a complex regulatory environment, for which specific knowledge by
sector, geography and even region is required. The ability to provide answers to this complexity on a larger
scale, increases the barriers to entry for the sector and diminishes the risk for digital disruption or
disintermediation. For a more detailed discussion of the regulatory landscape in which we operate, see
‘‘Regulation’’.

_Skilled labor shortages._ A public study conducted before the Covid-19 crisis by a management consulting
firm estimated that the gap between future labor supply and demand would result in a skilled labor
shortfall across a variety of economies, including in the Netherlands, Germany and France. By 2030, it
estimated that the top five financial centers could fail to generate $870 billion in annual revenue due to
labor shortages (with free movement of labor being unlikely to solve the skills shortage in European
financial centers), the manufacturing sector could face a global labor shortage of 7.9 million workers and
the technology, media and telecommunications (‘‘TMT’’) end-market could face a shortage of 4.3 million
workers and unrealized revenue of $450 billion. Within the financial and business end-markets, it
estimated that the Netherlands would face a shortage of up to 600,000 workers by 2030. Within the
manufacturing end-market, it estimated that the Netherlands worker shortage would be up to 600,000
workers and Germany worker shortage was estimated to be between 600,000 and 1.2 million workers by
2030. Within the TMT end-market, the shortage of workers was estimated to be up to 600,000 in each of
France and the Netherlands by 2030. We strongly believe that the current Covid-19 crisis won’t
fundamentally change the results of this study in the future even if in the short-term, shortage levels may
be lower than expected in some end-markets.

The charts below illustrate the estimated market size for certain end-markets in the Netherlands, Germany
and France, as well as the unrealized output as a percentage of the economy as at 2030.

11DEC202017525777

Note: In preparing the above chart we relied on information from a study by a management consulting firm released before the
Covid-19 crisis.

Our HR solutions offer services that supply workers in each of these three end-markets and we believe we
will be well placed to assist clients in meeting the labor and demand gap.

**Our Addressable Market**

We operate primarily in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands in a variety of specialties with a
combined addressable market of approximately A35 billion in revenue as of 2017 (the ‘‘Addressable
**Market’’). We use the term ‘‘Addressable Market’’ to refer to the portion of our Total Market which has**
been narrowed down to reflect the market size, expressed in terms of revenue, for each of our business
units according to the particular staffing, sourcing or consulting services for the particular clients, industrial
and geographic end-markets each such business unit currently serves. Before the Covid-19 crisis, we
expected our Addressable Markets to grow at a rate of approximately 6% per annum in revenues to an
estimated A48 billion by 2023, a growth rate above that of the broader staffing solutions industry, driven by
a variety of favorable end-market dynamics leading to increases in outsourcing and billing rates.

We operate through nine business units in three segments: engineering and consulting; specialized staffing
and general staffing. The discussion below focuses on the key factors affecting each of our business units’
Addressable Markets.

**_Engineering and Consulting_**

We operate five business units within our engineering and consulting segment, covering consulting in
France, financial and information technology consulting and white collar secondment of engineers and
technicians in the Netherlands and legal, engineering and technician secondment in Belgium. The size of
the combined Addressable Markets for our engineering and consulting segment was approximately
A12 billion in 2017, and was expected before the Covid-19 crisis to grow at approximately 3.4% per annum
to A14 billion by 2023, driven by increased research and development spending in France and construction
projects in Belgium and the Netherlands.

_Abylsen_

Abylsen is an engineering consulting solutions multi-specialist focused on the French market.

End-market size and outlook

Abylsen’s Addressable Market consists of the entire market for consulting staffing in France, and
represented approximately A9.7 billion in annual revenue in 2017. Before the Covid-19 crisis, Abylsen’s
Addressable Market was expected to grow between 2% and 4% per annum over the period between 2017
and 2023 to A11.4 billion. From 2012 to 2017, Abylsen’s Addressable Market grew between 1.5% and 2%
annually in revenue.


11DEC202017525777


End-market drivers


Historically, growth in Abylsen’s Addressable Market has been driven by companies’ spending on research
and development. It is expected that, once markets have recovered from the Covid-19 crisis, such spending
will increase again going forwards and will be the key driver of growth in Abylsen’s Addressable Market, as
end-markets reliant on research and development (such as the automotive, energy, pharmaceutical and
aerospace industries) respond and adapt to changing technologies for their sustained growth. Additional

factors such as increased outsourcing penetration (France is already one of the most mature countries for
outsourcing of research and development) and increasing billing rates (moderate due to pre-existing
difficulties in sourcing engineers in France) are likely to further drive market growth in the future.

Competitive landscape

Competition in Abylsen’s Addressable Market includes a lot of players but is highly fragmented, with the
four largest players capturing less than 30% of the market in 2017. The market is defined by three types of
competitors: large global consulting firms (including Altran, Alten, Akka and Assystem), mid-size global/
regional firms (such as Sii, MCA, agap2 and Davidson) and smaller regional/local firms. Abylsen falls into
the mid-size global/regional category, with a smaller market share than the four large global consulting
firms. Nevertheless, Abylsen has been growing faster and achieved a higher EBITDA margin than its larger
competitors.

_Redmore_

Redmore is a provider of specialized secondment and consulting services, primarily for the financial
services end-market.

End-market size and outlook

Redmore’s Addressable Market consists of three markets in the Netherlands: the market for secondment
of financial specialists, the market for actuarial and risk consulting and the market for ERP/finance and
control consulting (and excludes ITDS). The size of Redmore’s Addressable Market was approximately
A0.6 billion in 2017. Before the Covid-19 crisis, this Addressable Market was expected to grow at an annual
rate of approximately 6% over the 2017-2023 period to an estimated A0.8 billion in revenue in 2023.

End-market drivers

Over the past 15 years an increase in secondment penetration in the market has been the main driver of
growth in the Netherlands. Post the Covid-19 crisis recovery period, growth in Redmore’s specific client
end-markets in the coming years is expected to be driven by an increasing need for specialist positions in
the financial sector as a result of changing regulations, compliance, digitization and consolidation.

Competitive landscape

Redmore competes with various entities in the financial services end-market including the big four
accounting firms (namely, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers), as well as other
professional services and consultancy firms. Though the competitive environment for each of Redmore’s
niche entities is different, strong consolidation of the market in recent years has resulted in significant
growth for both Redmore and its competitors. We believe that Redmore’s businesses are leaders in their
respective Addressable Markets in terms of revenue. Redmore is built around four labels with each serving
a specific niche:

_Talent&Pro focuses on secondment in the banking, insurance, pensions and actuarial end-markets._
Talent&Pro is a significant player in the financial secondment market in the Netherlands, facing
competition from a variety of other firms, including Brunel, which has a broad focus across IT, finance,
engineering and law, Welten, which is specialized in candidate training with project based work, and Young
Capital, which is a digital disruptor across the finance, sales, IT and marketing end-markets.

_Triple A focuses on financial consulting in actuarial and risk management, with actuarial consultancy firms,_
including Willis Tower Watson, Mercer, and Milliman, and the big four accounting firms as its most
significant competitors.

_Profource focuses on finance staffing, enterprise resource planning (‘‘ERP’’) consulting and provides_
business process outsourcing services. As such, it maintains a unique market position which combines
expertise in finance and ERP. It faces competition from the big four accounting firms, whose consulting
departments include both finance and ERP, Eiffel, which is specialized in finance and legal staffing,
focusing on the government sector, and DPA, which is focused on candidate training in the finance, IT and
engineering end-markets.

119


-----

_ITDS provides specialist consulting for insurance companies, pension funds and banks, focusing on risk_
management, digital transformation, and cost-saving programs. Competitors for ITDS are Accenture,
Deloitte and Capgemini.

_Vialegis_

Vialegis primarily specializes in the legal staffing solutions market in Belgium, though it has developed
activities in Spain, Luxembourg and Germany over recent years. Vialegis operates in two primary niches:
legal interim management and secondment as well as legal search and selection, both of which are
relatively small and nascent markets expected to grow rapidly in the future.

End-market size and outlook

Vialegis’ Addressable Market consists of the legal services market in Belgium, comprising approximately
A30-45 million in revenue. Before the Covid-19 crisis, its Addressable Market was expected to grow at a
rate of 8-9% per annum over the 2017-2023 period.

End-market drivers

Post recovery, Vialegis’ growth is expected to be primarily driven by increasing legal complexity leading to
the need for more legal specialist profiles at internal legal positions within companies. In addition, the
trend toward outsourcing which is expected to remain strong, will contribute to the increase in demand for
legal staffing candidates and billing rates are expected to increase moderately above inflation.

Competitive landscape

In both of its specialties in Belgium, Vialegis is the market leader, with its top two competitors being
YouConnect and USG Professionals. Vialegis holds an approximate 30% share of the legal interim
management and secondment market and together with YouConnect and USG Professionals held 55% of
the market share. In the Belgium legal search and selection market, Vialegis holds an approximate 40%
market share in a market where it and its two top competitors together hold an estimated 70% share of the
market.

_Gritt (formerly TEC Alliance)_

Gritt is a multi-specialist in the secondment and project management of technicians and engineers for the
Belgian construction end-market. Gritt serves a combined Addressable Market of between A375 million
and A525 million in revenue as of 2017, which before the Covid-19 crisis was expected to grow to
A0.6 billion by 2023. Gritt focuses on three distinct market niches each with its own specific drivers and
competition:

_Gritt focuses on the secondment of engineers in Antwerp and, to a lesser extent, Flanders with a focus on_
the chemical, pharmaceutical and life science end-markets. Gritt’s Addressable Market was estimated at a
total size of approximately A150-A200 million by revenue in 2017. It was expected before the Covid-19 crisis
to increase by 3-4% per annum between 2017 and 2023, driven by an increase in capital expenditures, a
moderate increase in outsourcing and a moderate increase of billing rates relative to inflation. Gritt is the
market leader in its end-markets within the Antwerp/Flanders area. The market includes a lot of players
with strong competition from certain larger Benelux competitors such as STAR engineering as well as
more specialized competition from Talenco.

_Logi-technic focuses on the secondment of technicians in East and West Flanders with a focus on recurring_
maintenance and facility management needs for industrial equipment in the food end-market.
Logi-technic’s Addressable Market consists of the technician staffing market in Flanders, and was
estimated at a total size of A150-A200 million by revenue in 2017, with an estimated growth, before the
Covid-19 crisis, of 3-5% per annum between 2017 and 2023. This growth is largely due to a growing
shortage of skilled technicians as a result of existing high employment rates in Flanders, driving billing
rates higher as well as recurring business needs for maintenance of installed equipment. Such growth is
expected to be seen in the future, once markets have recovered from the current Covid-19 crisis.

Logi-technic is the local market leader within a fragmented market of local Benelux specialist firms,
including the likes of Actum and Yontec.

120


-----

_TEC Projects provides end-to-end project management services to install and maintain telecommunications_
network infrastructure. TEC Projects’ market can be further subdivided into several niches, each of which
we expect to grow in the near future due, in large part, to already planned investments, such as: (i) wireless
outdoor infrastructure, which had an estimated total Addressable Market size of A60-A65 million in
revenue as of 2017 and was expected to grow, before the Covid-19 crisis, at approximately 9% per annum
between 2017 and 2023 due largely to planned infrastructure spending for 5G wireless networks; (ii) fixed
infrastructure, which had an estimated total Addressable Market size of A20-A25 million in revenue as of
2017 and was expected to grow at approximately 9% per annum between 2017 and 2023 due largely to
planned infrastructure spending for Proximus FTTx program as well as Fiber-to-the-Site access programs;
and (iii) increased coverage of multi-operator distributed antenna systems in indoor buildings, which had
an estimated total Addressable Market size of A15-A20 million in revenue as of 2017 and was expected to
grow at approximately 9% per annum between 2017 and 2023. We believe the growth in these markets will
resume once they have recovered from the impact of the current crisis.

TEC Projects is a leader in the market, which is split between firms providing end-to-end network roll-out
and engineering acquisition providers.

On June 23, 2020, a share and receivable transfer agreement was signed resulting in the sale of GRITT
Projects NV. The Group, via its subsidiaries GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV held 100% of the shares in
GRITT Projects NV. The sale of GRITT Projects NV entailed (i) a capital increase done by GRITT NV
and Logi-Technic NV of A3.24 million; and (ii) the sale of the shares held by GRITT NV and
Logi-Technic NV, against EUR 1 closing price. As a result, a total loss of A19.92 million was recorded in the
nine months ended September 30, 2020. See the Notes to the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information.

_Continu_

Continu is a Dutch engineering consulting and technical outsourcing specialist primarily serving SMEs
with activities ranging from the secondment of engineers for project development to outsourcing of
technicians for project execution.

End-market size and outlook

Continu serves the Dutch engineering and construction markets, which have experienced steady growth
over the past several years. Continu’s Addressable Market consists of the staffing market for infrastructure,
engineering and construction end-markets in the Netherlands, and was estimated at approximately
A1 billion in revenue in 2017. Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, this market was expected to expand at an average
rate per annum of 7-8% to reach approximately A1.5 billion in revenue by 2023.

End-market drivers

Post recovery, growth in Continu’s Addressable Market is expected to be mainly driven by two factors:

- growth among SMEs within engineering and construction, which accounts for 3-4% (or approximately
half) of projected growth in Continu’s Addressable Market and largely stems from infrastructure
projects, which typically have long project durations and tend to have a predictable revenue stream;
and

- a continued shortage of mid to high-skilled engineers and technicians able to work on infrastructure
and engineering projects, leading to increased outsourcing penetration and accounting for the
remaining 3-4% of growth in Continu’s Addressable Market, as the temporary to permanent model
has been successful and desirable in an environment where the demand for permanent labor exceeds
its supply.

Competitive landscape

Continu benefits from a high level of expertise and broad national coverage, and is the top three player in
its Addressable Market in terms of revenue. Its main competitors include: TMC, which is mostly focused
on software and electrical engineering, Voort, which focuses on a similar specialty as Continu, and Brunel,
which focuses on the oil and gas sector.

**_Specialized Staffing_**

Our specialized staffing segment includes our operating companies Accent and Covebo, which cover the
short-term employment market for high demand mid-skilled blue-collar workers in Belgium and the
Netherlands, respectively. Both of these geographic end-markets have seen significant growth over the past
years, as long term trends in the staffing solutions industry combined with a tightening labor market have
increased demand for service providers like us to fill the need for specialized workers. The combined
Addressable Market for both Accent and Covebo represented approximately A8 billion in revenue as of
2017, and prior to the Covid-19 crisis, was expected to grow at a rate of more than 6% per annum between
2017 and 2023 to reach a size of A12 billion by 2023. Growth in the future will continue to be largely driven
by growing economies in both regions and end-markets in which Accent and Covebo provide services, as
well as a large and growing gap between the demand for certain specialized positions and the supply of
candidates willing to perform these jobs.

_Accent_

Accent primarily operates in the specialized staffing sector in Belgium, focusing particularly on Flanders.

End-market size and outlook

The Belgian specialized staffing market has experienced approximately 7.5% annual revenue growth over
the period from 2012 to 2017. It is estimated that Accent’s Addressable Market, which consists of the
general staffing market in Belgium, was approximately A6.2 billion in revenue as of 2017. Prior to the
Covid-19 crisis, this market was expected to continue to grow at a rate of approximately 6.5% annually to
reach A9.3 billion by 2023.

End-market drivers

Post recovery from the current crisis, growth in the Belgian staffing solutions industry will continue to be
largely driven by the tightening of the Belgian labor market as employment is growing faster than the
active population, particularly in Flanders. This trend results in fewer job seekers per vacancy leading to a
scarcity of candidates. As a result, demand has grown for companies like ours that are able to provide
appropriate qualified candidates to clients in need of staffing and this demand is expected to continue in
the future.

Competitive landscape

Accent was the fourth-largest staffing provider in terms of 2017 revenue within the Belgian total staffing
market, behind the larger staffing firms of Randstad, Recruit and Adecco, each of which focuses on larger
accounts, which are typically lower margins. However, within its more specialized Addressable Market,
which tends to command higher EBITDA margins, Accent is the largest firm by revenue, with more than
twice the annual revenue of its closest competitors, Actief Interim and Daoust.

_Covebo_

Covebo is a specialized staffing provider in the Netherlands for high-demand low-skilled blue-collar
workers in the food production and logistics end-markets, as well as mid-skilled blue-collar workers in the
construction end-market.

End-market size and outlook

Covebo had an Addressable Market of approximately A2 billion in revenue as of 2017, consisting of the
staffing market in the Netherlands in the trade, engineering, logistics and construction end-markets. Prior
to the Covid-19 impact, its Addressable Market was expected to grow at approximately 5-7% per annum to
reach an estimated A2.8 billion by 2023.

End-market drivers

Structural growth in Covebo’s Addressable Market is due to a variety of factors, including:

- underlying growth in the Dutch construction, engineering and logistics and food production
end-markets;

122


-----

- growth due to the increasing penetration of temporary staffing as the demand for permanent labor
exceeds its supply; and

- increases in billing rates to correlate with salary increases within its clients’ end-markets.

There is a general scarcity in the Dutch domestic workforce willing to work in these end-markets due to
changing perceptions of working conditions and possible night shifts as a result of the increased premium
_on quality of life global trend, favoring companies like us with the ability to source candidates for these_
positions internationally.

Competitive landscape

Covebo competes with smaller, regional or local competitors and larger generalists. Regional peers
include: Otto Workforce, a direct competitor and that has a similar end-market focus and sourcing strategy
to Covebo, though it is smaller in geographical scope; and Olympia, which is a mid-sized firm, larger than
Covebo, serving most end-markets throughout the Netherlands. Smaller competitors, such as VDB, Sherpa
and McDOIT, typically compete on smaller assignments but find it difficult to match Covebo on price as
they provide candidates in lower volumes. The larger generalists, such as Randstad and Adecco compete
heavily in volume driven projects, yet find it difficult to serve the small-volume, specialized niches where
we excel and do not offer a full service package or training.

**_General Staffing_**

Our operating companies TimePartner and Zaquensis both address the general staffing market in
Germany, providing low-skilled temporary workers for clients across a broad range of end-markets. As a
result, they are affected by similar market factors and face similar competition.

_German general staffing market size and outlook_

As of 2017, the Addressable Market for both TimePartner and Zaquensis consists of the German general
staffing market and totalled approximately A14.7 billion in revenue. Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, these
business units’ Addressable Market was expected to grow at an annual rate of 6.4% to 2023 to reach an
estimated A21.3 billion. Within the overall staffing market in Germany, the low-skilled segment is the
largest (at approximately 55% of the total staffing market) and has been the fastest growing in terms of
overall numbers of temporary employees over the period between 2013 and 2017. Over this period, it grew
by an annual rate of approximately 6.5% in terms of number of temporary workers and by approximately
9.2% in terms of total market value.

_German general staffing market drivers_

In the future, it is expected that growth in this market will be driven by an increase in the number of hours
worked and overall temporary staffing penetration as decreasing unemployment and a shortage of
low-skilled blue collar workers will force companies to seek out alternatives to source qualified candidates.
Billing rates are also expected to increase driven by the increase in minimum wages for temporary workers
established as a result of regulatory reform.

_Arbeitnehmer¨uberlassungsgesetz (A UG) regulatory reform[¨]_

The AUG reform mainly had an impact on 2018 and 2019 revenue figures. Further impacted by the[¨]
lockdowns, revenue continued to decline in the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter of
2020. Since May 2020, revenues have started to grow and have reached numbers in October and November
2020 that are above the 2019 revenue figures. The anticipated growth in TimePartner’s and Zaquensis’
Addressable Market is expected to continue. The AUG reform resulted in a decrease in the market, since[¨]
key aspects of the AUG regulatory reform include: a decrease in the amount of time that a temporary[¨]
worker can work for the same company to 18 months, after which the worker must be released from the
company or hired into the general payroll; after a maximum of 9 months, a temporary worker must be paid
the same as an equivalent permanent worker; striking employees cannot be replaced with temporary
workers; and the employer must declare all temporary workers to authorities from the start of their
contracts. This reform has led approximately 20% of temporary workers to be fall within the scope of the
new law, with 50% of those employees actually taken into a client’s payroll following the end of the
18-month period. These changes will mostly negatively affect small temporary staffing firms without access
to a broad client base, that cannot easily transfer employees after 18 months. Additionally, forcing

123


-----

companies to pay temporary workers equal pay after nine months will increase the average price point on
the market thus positively impacting revenues to staffing firms. Furthermore, total staffing penetration is
expected to continue to increase as the supply of workers decreases due to endemic factors, such as
record-low German unemployment and the desire of German companies to use temporary staffing as a
strategic flexibility solution. For a more detailed discussion of the regulatory landscape in which we
operate, see ‘‘Regulation’’.

_German general staffing competitive landscape_

The competitive marketplace for staffing within the low-skilled labor market in Germany is highly
fragmented, with around 10,000 small players taking more than 70% of the total market share. Taken
together, TimePartner and Zaquensis are within the top ten firms by market share overall in a market
where the top fifteen firms only amount to a 27% market share.

**OUR BUSINESS**

You should read this section of this Offering Memorandum in conjunction with the more detailed
information contained in this Offering Memorandum, including the financial and other information
appearing in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’.

**Overview**

We are a leading provider of HR solutions in key European staffing markets, offering complementary HR
staffing solutions and services through three segments and a well-developed portfolio of specialized
business units across various geographies. We also offer digital recruiting through dedicated platforms. Our
engineering and consulting segment is focused on supplying clients with highly skilled white-collar and
mid- to highly skilled construction professionals to meet clients’ specialized needs in a variety of
end-markets including financial, industrial and construction end-markets. Our specialized staffing segment
typically supplies a small number of high demand mid-skilled blue-collar and white-collar workers (sourced
increasingly from outside our primary markets) to clients for specialized positions. Finally, our general
staffing segment focuses on a wide range of end-markets in Germany by typically providing clients with
lower-skilled blue collar workers, and to a lesser extent white-collar workers, in certain categories of
employment that are experiencing significant labor shortages.

Each of our segments is comprised of business units that have leading positions in their respective markets
and their own brand(s) which are used to market their specialized HR solutions. Our engineering and
consulting segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu, Vialegis, Redmore and Gritt (formerly TEC
Alliance) business units, as well as ibb and AERO, which are sub-business units of TimePartner. This
segment has the broadest geographic footprint, though its operations are concentrated in France, Belgium
and the Netherlands. Our specialized staffing segment is comprised of our Accent and Covebo business
units, with their primary operations in Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively, as well as branches in
countries that form part of their international recruiting networks. Our general staffing segment is
comprised of our TimePartner and Zaquensis business units which provide staffing solutions in Germany.
Our engineering and consulting, specialized staffing and generalized staffing segments represented 55.1%,
36.0% and 8.8%, respectively, of our Group’s EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup
eliminations) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Since our founding, the Group has expanded from a presence in only Belgium to 10 countries in Europe.
We have increased our revenue from approximately A127 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 to
A1.76 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. As at September 30, 2020 we had 596 branches, 3,023
in-house full-time equivalent employees and 45,824 job candidates at work. We believe our particular focus
on concentrating our services in geographic markets with attractive staffing fundamentals, supplying
specialized and niche staffing, focusing on SME clients, serving a diversified range of clients and
end-markets, implementing a strong entrepreneurial drive and remuneration system and following a
disciplined approach to strategic acquisitions have contributed to our growth.

Our industry benefits from a number of long-term underlying trends, such as ageing populations, increased
competition for talent, technological changes, re-skilling and lifelong learning among workers, workers’
increased premium on quality of life, and regulatory trends that have supported sector growth and are
projected to continue driving growth of the sector over the medium term.

The Covid-19 crisis has severely impacted the economy across all our key markets in 2020 with real GDP
growth expected to be down by 5 to 10% at the end of 2020 according to the IMF. The lockdown measures
have led to a significant reduction in staffing activities across our key markets, with clients delaying or
cancelling their needs for temp workers.

Following the lifting of the restrictions and supported by the programs sponsored by the governments, the
economy is now expected to rebound in all our key markets with real GDP expected to grow by 4% to 6%
for 2021 (IMF outlook from October 2020). With regard to the staffing market in general, recovery has
already started across our key markets and, according to Staffing Industry Analysts, the staffing market is
expected to rebound in 2021 across our key markets, albeit not uniformly.

The market value of our Addressable Market for our existing HR solutions in the primary geographies and
end-markets in which we currently operate was estimated at A35 billion in 2017, comprising A12 billion for
the engineering and consulting market, A8 billion for the specialized staffing markets and A15 billion for
the general staffing market. Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, the market value of our Addressable Market was
expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6% from 2017 through 2023. We believe that such

125


-----

growth is to be expected in the future, although with a delay due to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis,
driven by the long term underlying trends mentioned above, and that we are poised to continue growing at
or above the industry average growth rate in the future.

**History**

We were founded in 1995 by Philip Cracco and Conny Vandendriessche as Accent, a Belgium-based
recruiting firm. We acquired Logi-technic in 2009 and Bekaert Technics in 2010, expanding our operations
within Belgium. Over the course of 2012 to 2014, Naxicap, a French private equity firm, acquired a
majority stake in our business.

Under Naxicap, our business has expanded significantly to offer specialized HR solutions in multiple
European markets. Our business made its first cross-border acquisition in March 2015, acquiring the
French staffing firm Abylsen, which became one of our business units and seconds engineers through
multiple offices across France, Belgium and Switzerland. Since 2015, our expansion accelerated through
Organic Growth and through acquisitions, starting with two other major acquisitions in 2015, which have
since become business units: Covebo, a Dutch specialized temporary staffing company sourcing Polish
workers through a network in Poland and the Netherlands, and Continu, a Dutch professional staffing
company seconding white-collar technical professionals in the construction, civil and industrial engineering
end-markets. We have since acquired firms that have become other business units of our Group, such as
Redmore, Vialegis, Gritt (formerly TEC Alliance), TimePartner and Zaquensis. See ‘‘Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Acquisitions, disposals and the_
_Comparability of our Consolidated Financial Statements’’_

In 2018, we implemented a legal reorganization which was completed in January 2019, as a result of which
our holding companies, House of HR NV and The House of Pledge NV, hold 100% of the equity interests
(with the exception of one share in certain instances) in each of top entities associated with the Group’s
nine business units (the ‘‘2018 legal reorganization’’). The nine business units belong to one of three
staffing segments which are also the Group’s financial reporting segments: engineering and consulting,
specialized staffing and general staffing. See ‘‘Consolidated Financial Statements For the Period Ended
_31 December 2019—Note 3—Group structure of the House of HR’’ for further information._

**Our Strengths**

We believe we benefit from the following key strengths:

**_We operate exclusively in attractive markets that are well positioned for rebound and future growth._**

The staffing industry benefits from a number of long-term underlying trends that have supported our
industry’s historical and projected medium term growth. In addition to benefiting from the attractive
long-term trends underlying the staffing market, we have strategically chosen geographic markets that
provide strong fundamentals in order to take full advantage of favorable trends. With this double
advantage, together with the success of our business model, we have been able to grow at a higher rate
than our peers and to rebound quickly from 2020’s Covid-19 induced lockdowns.

Demand for the types of solutions we provide is expected to continue growing in the future due to a
number of positive secular trends, including:

- Ageing populations in our target markets

- Technological changes affecting job candidates’ search for employment opportunities

- Younger workers’ prioritization of career mobility

- The need for workers to re-skill to adapt to changing work opportunities

- Companies’ desire to address issues relating to diversity, inclusion and corporate social responsibility

- Workers’ increased premium on quality of life

- Financial pressures resulting in increased outsourcing and offshoring.

For a detailed discussion of these and other trends affecting our industry and end-markets, see ‘‘Industry
_and Market Overview’’._

126


-----

We have also sought out geographic markets in Europe where macroeconomic and other factors are
particularly attractive for companies providing HR solutions. The countries in which we are principally
active, namely Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, each demonstrate favorable attributes in
the pre-Covid-19 environment. For example, pre-Covid-19 each benefited from a stable and growing
economy marked by relatively high staffing penetration, low unemployment and high salaries. Moreover,
European Union and national regulations applicable in our key countries tend to reinforce protection of
permanent workers, which can lead companies to favor temporary work and outsourcing, especially in
recovery periods after a trough in the cycle, to scale up their workforce. At the same time, legislation in the
countries in which we principally operate allows for multiple temporary staffing solutions.

Finally, Western Europe generally is experiencing a chronic and growing large skill supply and demand
gap, obliging companies to look beyond traditional job candidate sourcing and seek the help of staffing
solutions providers like us, with the ability to recruit job candidates with specific profiles for jobs that are
particularly difficult to fill, from abroad where needed, as we draw upon an international talent pool and
provide required training.

Due in part to the above mentioned factors, our various end-markets demonstrated organic revenue
growth of between 4 and 10 percentage points above the industry average between 2014 and 2019. Before
the Covid-19 crisis, the market value of our Addressable Market, which reflects our focus on scarcity
driven roles and specialized end-markets, was expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6%
from 2017 through 2023. This compared to expected growth of approximately 4% from 2017 through 2023
in the Total Market (as defined below), which reflected the larger staffing market.

Along with the most of the other economic sectors, the Covid-19 crisis and the two lockdown periods have
severely impacted the economy and the staffing market in general. According to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), as of October 2020, the 2020 real gross domestic product (real GDP) in our four
key markets is expected to go down by 8.3% in Belgium, 9.8% in France, 6.0% in Germany and 5.4% in the
Netherlands. However, in all our markets of operations, governments have put in place significant
sponsored programs to support the economy, preserve jobs and prevent defaults. For further information,
please see ‘‘Industry and Market Overview.’’

Governments in each of our key markets are expecting a rebound of the economy, especially assuming the
availability of an effective vaccine in 2021. As such, in 2021, Belgium real GDP is expected to grow by
5.4%, France real GDP by 6.0%, Germany real GDP by 4.2% and the Netherlands real GDP by 4.0%,
according to IMF analyses as of October 2020. With regard to the staffing industry in general, recovery
periods after a crisis usually favor temporary work and outsourcing as companies start to scale up their
workforce while limiting the weight on their cost base. It is especially true in countries such as the markets
in which we operate, in which the permanent workers are more protected, which limits companies’
flexibility. As a consequence, the staffing market has already starting to recover. We saw recovery in our
sales from May to September 2020. In October 2020, a second round of lockdown measures was
announced, which halted the growth. The following chart of our sales for each month from January to
November 2020 as a percentage of our sales for the same month in 2019 shows the effect of the lockdowns
in March and April 2020 and the recovery from May to November 2020:

Note: In preparing the above chart, we have used historical information prepared on the basis described in ‘‘Presentation of Financial

With regard to 2021, according to Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA—Global Staffing Industry Market
Estimates and Forecast, November 2020, https://staffingindustry.com/), the staffing market is expected to
rebound in our all key countries, albeit not uniformly. In 2021, staffing revenue is expected to increase by
5% in Belgium, 18% in France, 13% in Germany and 3% in the Netherlands.

We believe that the fundamentals of our Addressable Market remain strong in the medium-term and we
believe we are poised to continue growing at or above the industry average growth rate in the future due to
our differentiated business model and focus on our Addressable Market.

**_Our scale within a fragmented market has resulted in strong market positions in all our target markets._**

We believe that the scale of our business constitutes a significant competitive advantage within the
fragmented markets in which we operate. Our various operating companies have leading positions in their
market segments, as noted in the below selection of our indicative market positions by revenue in 2017
based on the Addressable Market (unless otherwise indicated) in which each operates.

Many of our operating companies are reference players within their respective specialty, benefiting from
the virtuous circle of competitive leadership, with their track record enabling them to capture a high
percentage of their market growth and benefiting from brand loyalty and pricing power as a result. Clients
make staffing decisions at a local level and our large footprint with high branch density allows us to be
physically present in the communities where our clients operate, providing a key competitive advantage for
us. We believe our current position is cemented by an impressive track record in placing and training job
candidates and a top reputation within the market due to our local market knowledge, our large talent
pool and talent acquisition capabilities and thought leadership within the field.

**_We are well positioned to restart our outstanding record of both organic and external growth._**

We have grown our business over recent years both organically and through targeted, strategic and valueaccretive acquisitions.

We achieved Organic Growth of 4.5% in 2019 and 12.3% in 2018. We believe that our largely consistent
positive Organic Growth in each business segment and for the _pro forma perimeter outperforms the_
market and evidences the success of our differentiated business model. See the chart below to see our
revenue growth since 2007, which reflects both organic and inorganic growth.

We believe our Organic Growth is largely attributable to our ‘‘cell division’’ expansion strategy, in which we
secure new sales before committing to additional costs. As commercial activity increases over time and
reaches the point at which clear expansion opportunities are identified, we hire additional sales personnel
at the existing branch to focus on developing these opportunities out of the existing office. A new,
dedicated commercial manager is appointed and given an agreed period of time in order to acquire new
clients or a new customer segment in a prospective area. Once these new clients have been secured and
adequate revenue has been generated, the commercial manager opens a new office to handle such clients
and becomes an office manager hiring their own staff. This strategy successfully expands sales revenues
before any costs of an additional branch are incurred by providing incentives for current branch operators
to identify and develop client relationships in their area with the prospect of managing a new branch
justified by these increased sales. We see this as a key method by which we have been able to continually
strengthen our geographic breadth and depth without pursuing acquisitions and with minimal risk, driving
our organic growth. We also believe that our variable compensation model, which rewards recruiters, sales
consultants and office managers at our branches for finding, matching and retaining job candidates, is also
an important contributor to our organic growth, particularly within our engineering and consulting
segment which does not use the ‘‘cell division’’ strategy.

When we have grown through acquisitions, we have done so with a rigorous discipline. We distinguish
between low-risk transactions at lower multiples that enable growth at the local level (bolt on acquisitions),
of which we have completed 18 since 2017, and platform acquisitions, where we expand our solutions, enter
new specialties or markets, of which we have successfully completed and integrated eight since 2015. In
2019, we also took a minority stake with a step-up mechanism to acquire majority ownership and control
over the coming years in a company that has developed a recruitment robot (using an AI-enabled chatbot).
We signed two share purchase agreements on December 4, 2020, one of which relates to an addition for
Abylsen, providing consulting services in the area of well-being and homeworking to French corporates,
and the other to an addition for Continu, focusing on engineering and high skilled technical profiles mainly
for the public sector.

When we evaluate a potential acquisition target, we review the opportunity through the rubric of a number
of stringent requirements designed to ensure fit with our overall strategy and culture. First, the target must
fit an identified strategic need to expand our geographic coverage, complement a specific specialty or fill a
niche skill gap. We also seek out targets with like-minded management teams with an entrepreneurial spirit
and long term commitment in order to ensure a strong overall cultural fit. We also evaluate the target’s
profitability, historic growth and other performance metrics, and assess whether it is a leader in its
addressable markets. Once we have identified and then acquired a target, we have a well-defined and
proven integration process that involves hooking the target into our Group reporting system and sharing
best practices. Local management teams are asked to either invest at group level or continue to be invested
at local level.

Our growth is represented below using the unaudited business unit accounts of Accent as well as those of
our other business units on the basis as described in the note to the chart below.

information presented above, in particular due to different accounting bases of preparation, and such variations could be material. As
such, you should not place undue reliance on the inclusion of such information. Furthermore, the growth presented in the chart is

In 2020 we have focused on stabilizing the business, client acquisition, accounts receivable collections and
prudent cash management given the exceptional Covid-19 crisis seen globally. We believe that the business
is currently stabilizing and will gradually return to growth once the current lockdown measures have ended.
During 2020 we did not reduce our headcount materially, and we opened more branches than were closed.
Our number of branches amounted to 596 at September 30, 2020, compared to 584 branches at
December 31, 2019. As a result, our commercial team and branch network remain largely intact, with a
healthy and stable customer base (21,066 unique clients as at September 30, 2020), as a base upon which
we can confidently rebound. So far, during the Covid-19 crisis, gross margins have not materially been
impacted and customers have not renegotiated prices. Increased sickness was noticed in some areas
affected by Covid-19, but at the same time, for those businesses that allowed working from home, sickness
rates were lower compared to the same period in 2019. We will also be starting 2021 from a position of
strength in terms of our high level of people at work, with 2.3 job candidates at work per client, 239 FTE’s
on the bench and 0.9% of bench time as a percentage of total paid hours in September 2020 (compared to
160 FTEs and 0.5% of bench time, respectively in September 2019). We believe we are very well positioned
to capture growth into 2021 and beyond. We have resumed our acquisition strategy described under ‘‘—
_Our Strategy—Target accretive acquisition opportunities to achieve European leadership.’’ We signed two share_
purchase agreements for bolt-on acquisitions in December 2020 and are considering other potential
acquisitions, including acquisition opportunities for which we have submitted non-binding offers.

The flexible cost structure enabled us to remain profitable despite the economic downturn in 2020.

Despite a significant decrease in sales, the decrease in our gross margin has remained limited due to our
flexible cost structure, as our costs of sales, which are mainly variable, represent over 80% of our total
costs.

Accent, Continu, Covebo, ZAQUENSIS and TimePartner mainly employ workers whose contracts can be
terminated immediately or who can be put on the bench without cost, as well as freelancers.

For workers with less flexible conditions, we were generally able to benefit from economic unemployment
measures that allowed us to decrease our costs of sales.

**_We benefit from a focus on specific end-markets and scarcity-driven job candidate profiles._**

We believe that our particular focus on specialized and niche staffing and our scarcity driven job candidate
profiles have yielded a unique model that is unmatched by any of our peers. We market our services under
brands that relate to specific specialized services offered by our business units or subunits. Our multiple
brand approach has proven effective in attracting and retaining clients. For example, our Facebook page of
Accent (55K) has in most instances almost twice the number of likes than the Facebook pages of our
competitors Randstad Belgium (21K), USG (Start) People (24K) or Adecco Belgium (35K) as at
September 2020. In addition to our unique brands, our business units are focused on particular
end-markets and job candidate profiles. We believe this deepens our knowledge of our clients’ needs and
our job candidates’ skills and qualifications, allowing us to more effectively match and place our job
candidates.

As a result of our multiple segments and business units, focus on specific industries and customer segments
and candidate profiles, we have a very diversified exposure to different end-markets, as illustrated in the
chart below.

resilience through this year’s Covid-19 crisis. In other sectors, we focus on niches where the nature of work
performed by job candidates is often related to less sensitive aspects of those end-markets—both in market
slowdowns and during Covid-19. A good example of this is Redmore, a provider of HR solutions to the
financial industry, which is generally considered sensitive to economic cycles. However, by focusing on high
demand, specialized job candidates for complex regulation-driven projects, the sensitivity to
macroeconomic cycles has proven to be non-existent during the Covid-19 pandemic, given that candidates
were continuing on specific (regulatory) projects in the financial institutions.

Through our business segments and brands in our core geographies, we provide HR solutions that meet
most of the top critical job shortages in those markets. Our focus on niche and specialty staffing highlights
the added value we can provide to companies looking for specific job candidate profiles which are often
difficult to find, and in our experience, clients are willing to attach a premium to such services and
conversely, it enables us to recruit and retain qualified job candidates. Even when we serve large corporate
clients, we believe our provision of specialized staffing solutions enables us to maintain pricing power as a
result of the quality and demand for our job candidates. Finally, our services are also utilized by our clients
throughout economic cycles, with temporary staffing solutions being an attractive option to clients both in
the early stages of an economic downturn as companies seek flexible solutions for staffing needs as well as
during a recovery period when the economic cycle is on its way up, allowing for maximum flexibility. In
certain instances today, some customers are now seeking to replace part of their permanent workforce by
more temporary and therefore more flexible solutions, allowing for maximum adaptability to their sales
potential. We believe post Covid-19, this trend will further increase.

**_We target smaller companies with local decision-making power._**

We believe that our client focus on SMEs and intermediate sized enterprises has in the past and will in the
future benefit our financial performance. According to a market study commissioned by the Group, for the
year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 77% of our sales were with SMEs or intermediate sized
enterprises with approximately 32% of these being small enterprises, approximately 29% being medium
enterprises and approximately 17% being intermediate sized enterprises.

We target SMEs and intermediate sized enterprises with local decision-making power. This means that we
generally do not participate in large tenders for the provision of a larger number of job candidates, nor do
we deal and negotiate with central procurement teams or HR departments. We believe that SMEs and
intermediate sized enterprises form a particularly attractive client base for a number of reasons. First, they
tend to be highly reliant on each employee and have lower workforce anticipation capabilities than large
corporates, meaning that when they need to hire someone, they need someone fairly quickly and place a
premium on the ability to source job candidates to meet their time constraints. Second, such clients often
have a faster decision-making process compared to large corporates and lack purchasing departments, so
we may face less pricing pressure from such companies. Additionally, they more often than not have
neither the resources nor the knowledge to dedicate to HR and therefore are willing to outsource many of
their staffing-related needs and expertise to providers like us who can provide a full service offering at all
stages of the recruitment lifecycle. SMEs often have limited employer branding and therefore may
experience difficulty in reaching the best job candidates without access to the talent pool of a staffing
solutions provider like us. Finally, we believe that the ability to find a very specific candidate with the right
cultural fit is very important for SMEs, since they typically have small teams and often seek a particular
candidate who is not only qualified for the job, but also matches the client’s corporate culture. The ability
to match such job candidates benefits from our blend of human and digital touchpoints, with regular
interaction with clients and job candidates throughout the recruitment lifecycle (including our
international recruiting capabilities). HR staffing solutions also operate in a complex regulatory
environment, for which specific knowledge by sector, geography and even region is required. The ability to
provide answers to this complexity on a larger scale increases the barriers to entry for the sector and
diminishes the risk for digital disruption or disintermediation.

We are able to meet SMEs’ needs through our deep end-market knowledge, reactivity and proximity to our
clients by providing both a full suite of end-to-end service and a large pool of resources for these clients.
We believe that our unique positioning largely protects us from competition in the areas in which we
operate, providing several barriers to entry. Our geographical footprint, branch density and our ability to
recruit internationally would be quite challenging to replicate and are essential to fostering the client
relationships and granular geographic reach necessary to reach our targeted SME clients. Furthermore, we
maintain and have access to a large database of job candidates to enable short matching times and have
acquired in-depth end-market experience through selective organic and external growth over many years,

which facilitates our ability to source, match and retain job candidates and clients. Strict quantitative and
qualitative KPI monitoring on inflow and matching further drive our operational excellence. These factors
have fueled our strong track record of successful employment relationships and our top tier reputation
within our end-markets.

Our strategy of targeting SMEs as our primary client base also increases the resilience of our operations
when presented with an economic downturn, as SMEs are less likely to lay off workers in a downturn and
fare better at maintaining their level of employment than larger companies. In addition, the chart below
shows that SMEs continued to grow their size during the 2008 – 2009 financial crisis and reduced their
number of employees far less, and in some cases even increased their number of employees, compared to
larger companies, whose number of employees declined during that time:

The ongoing Covid-19 crisis has had a major impact on the global economy, including SMEs’ activities,
especially as a result of severe lockdown policies that have been put in place. However, during the ongoing
Covid-19 crisis, governments in all our key countries of operation have been particularly focused on
providing needed support to SMEs. During this extraordinary period, we have been focused on continuing
to provide vital staffing services to our highly diversified customer base in specialized markets, and markets
which require a special expertise.

Despite the Covid-19 crisis, we are making continued efforts to expand our highly diversified client base
further. For example, Covebo held a ‘golden shoe’ competition to attract more new customers and at
Abylsen, the action ‘Do it day championship’ was launched to reach new customers. The business focus at
Accent has been on reaching new customers and opening new opportunities. For example, during the first
lockdown, Accent targeted fruit and vegetable farmers that were unable to use foreign seasonal workers
given the lockdown measures. Accent also launched the initiative ShareJobs, to ask companies to match
companies that had temporarily unemployed staff with other business that had significant shortages
(e.g. farmers, food retailers).

Additionally, by focusing on SMEs and intermediate sized enterprises and by monitoring the credit of our
customers diligently, we significantly reduce our client credit risk exposure. We served 19,992 unique
clients for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Our top client represented only 1.5% of our
revenue and our top ten clients represented only 8.2% of our revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020. Most of our customers receive only a small number of staff from us at any point in
time, and our services can generally be withdrawn quickly if a customer is unable to pay. In the specialized
staffing segment, customers are typically invoiced on a weekly basis, with payment terms ranging from zero
days up to 60 days, with a majority of customers on 30-day payment terms. Customers with no credit
history and very small customers get 0-day or 7-day payment terms, allowing us to monitor their payment
behavior very closely and to stop rendering services (i.e. people at work) if due dates for payment are not
adhered to. In the engineering and consulting segment, our customers are on average somewhat larger
SMEs and larger companies. In this segment, we typically invoice customers on a monthly basis, with
payment terms between 30 days and 60 days, or up to 90 days in France. Enhanced credit monitoring and
diligent accounts receivable collection during the Covid-19 crisis have allowed us to keep Days Sales
Outstanding, or DSO, stable at 52 days as of September 30, 2020, compared to 51 days as of September 30,
2019. We have credit insurance to protect our accounts receivable in place with a maximum liability
amount of up to A150 million.

**_We are at the forefront of digital innovations._**

The different steps of the value chain of our activities include a complex mix of tasks that have the
potential for high automation (such as job sourcing and job candidate matching) and those that need to be

more tailor-made for clients and job candidates and therefore require a human touch (such as interacting
with clients to know precisely what their staffing needs are and negotiation of HR contracts). We believe
we are a thought leader and ahead of our larger peers in many respects, by having already begun seizing
digital opportunities in order to both address new markets with innovative business models and improve
our own operations.

We recognize the importance of the digital marketplace to both businesses and job candidates, and we
have developed a comprehensive digital marketing strategy. For example, to draw potential job candidates
and clients to our websites, our marketing team uses search engine optimization to make our services easily
findable for all. All websites and vacancies posted have been adapted to the arrival of GoogleforJobs. We
also have an active social media presence, outpacing smaller competitors and opening new markets.
Finally, to complement our physical network of branches and reach new markets, we have pioneered
several successful disruptor technologies, including our SWOP application, which was upgraded in 2020
and allows job seekers to match with job listings, and has enabled the placement of an average of 67
contracts a month. The recent upgrade to the SWOP application allows a more complete vacancy offer and
therefore attract more candidates.

The following graphic shows the shows the success of the SWOP application from January 2019 through to
November 2020:

Our NOWJOBS platform is primarily geared to students and other seekers of one-off temporary jobs and
had more than 280,000 job candidates and more than 6,000 active companies participating in 2019. In June
2019 we launched our MyAccent app, allowing potential job candidates to interact via the Google Home
assistant with Accent’s list of open positions. We also launched our GIGHOUSE app focused on a digital
solution for freelancers/independent job candidates. We aim to leverage our experience as a disruptor in
the market to expand successful initiatives to our broader Group. Book’u is our planning tool, allowing
customers to plan both their permanent and temporary workforce in one solution, being in touch with this
workforce to communicate when they should be available and allowing to spot potential staffing shortages,
immediately posting these shortages at their staffing companies of choice. Softskills testing has been
developed together with the University of Ghent, to test ‘who you are’ as a person and to test ‘what type of
company do I want to work for’. These tests will allow for better (AI) matching of jobs with persons.
Finally Continu Connect will be launched in January/February 2021, showing all available candidates in a
region for our customers. All apps are developed taking into account reusability across all House of HR
operating companies’ benefitting therefore from the economies of scale House of HR has versus local
competitors and increasing the barriers to entry for our industry.

Given the above further developments, we were ideally positioned to leverage our leading digital
capabilities over the past year in order to continue connecting employers and employees. We have
continued investing in IT in 2020 and expect to continue prioritizing the digital venue going forward.

We are also innovating in our existing processes, identifying areas within our business that could benefit
from increased automation and zero-paper processes that are both job candidate- and client-facing, as well
as internal processes such as finance, procurement and marketing and communications. We believe the
efficiencies we can realize through this digitalization will produce cost savings while allowing us to meet the
ever-increasing demands of clients and job candidates.

**_We have a highly diversified, resilient and cash-generative financial profile and a decentralized structure,_**
**_allowing for fast decision making in times of crisis._**

Our differentiated business model, specific end-market and job candidate profile focus drives our highly
diversified revenue stream reflected by:

- four stable and attractive geographic markets;

- three different segments;

- nine business units with specialized brands;

- a network of over 596 branches per September 30, 2020;

- twenty international recruitment offices;

- end-market diversity (from the manufacturing, production, logistics and industry sectors), with no
end-market representing more than 31% of revenue;

- low client concentration with 19,992 unique clients year-to-date for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, with our top client representing 1.5% of our revenue and our top ten clients
representing 8.2% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020; and

- 45,824 job candidates at work as at September 30, 2020.

In addition to the diversification of our sources of revenue, our cost structure is largely variable. For 2019,
approximately 70.5% of our total operating expenses were variable, 24.5% were semi-variable and 5.0%
were fixed costs. Our cost of services, which represented 79.0% of our total operational expenses (costs of
services and operating expenses together) for the year ended December 31, 2019, is comprised of mostly
variable costs related to our people at work (mainly payroll, social security contributions, housing, car fleet
and subcontracting costs). In many of our jurisdictions, we are able to match the duration of the
employment of our job candidates and their placement, allowing us to be flexible in the deployment of our
job candidate resources. Gritt (formerly TEC Alliance), Abylsen, Redmore, AERO and ibb (the last two
being subunits of TimePartner) hire high-skilled specialists under indefinite contracts, which have in
previous years been considered as semi-variable, given our intention to retain the job candidates for as
long as possible, except for the costs related to freelancers and subcontractors, which are variable. As a
result of the Covid-19 crisis and the government measures available, some costs of sales linked to Gritt,
Abylsen, AERO, ibb & Vialegis that were previously considered to be semi-variable could be shifted to
variable.

The assets in our company are ‘‘human capital’’ which means we have limited fixed assets or cash tied up in
inventory. This results in limited capital expenditure requirements (approximately 1.5% of revenue) and
high _Pro Forma Cash Conversion, as illustrated by the following chart, which shows our normalized_ _Pro_
_Forma free cash flow and our_ _Pro Forma Cash Conversion of 92.6%, 92.8%, 91.9%, respectively, for the_
years 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Over the years, this strong cash flow growth and high cash conversion, combined with the completion of a
capital reduction in 2019, has allowed House of HR to delever on a net debt basis. The Group’s bolt-on
acquisitions also contributed to further EBITDA growth, which accelerated the deleveraging.

Note: In preparing the above chart, we have included historical revenue information that was prepared by prior management for
the period from 2008 through the date of such acquisition. This chart includes historical revenue information for all business
units that were within our consolidation perimeter as of September 30, 2020 and thereby includes TechMatch and excludes
Gritt Projects. Although we believe the underlying materials used and the basis of preparation to be reasonable, actual results
may vary from the indicative information presented above, in particular due to different accounting bases of preparation, and
such variations could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on the inclusion of such information.
Furthermore, the growth presented in the chart is prepared on a different basis than our Organic Growth presented
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(1) Total sales includes intercompany eliminations.

(2) EBITDA margin includes IFRS 16 adjustments. IFRS 16 adjustments for 2008 – 2017 were estimated based on IFRS 16
adjustments in 2019 as a percentage of revenue.

Directly before the Covid-19 pandemic, we took a number of measures which resulted in cash preservation
during the pandemic. Shortly before the pandemic hit, we launched a commercial finance offering in
Germany, and took additional steps focusing on credit control. We also extended our credit insurance
program with a maximum liability amount up to A150 million. We also operated with the support of
government measures to help businesses survive the pandemic, to the maximum extent possible. See ‘‘Our
_Strengths—We target smaller companies with local decision-making power.’’ Finally we made a temporary_
draw on our revolving credit facility, but repaid the draw when it was clear that this was not necessary.
Based on internal management accounts, we also maintained positive EBITDA in every individual month
of 2020 to date, throughout Covid-19.

We believe that as we continue to diversify our geographic, end-market and segment profile, particularly as
we grow our mix of services focused on engineering and consulting and specialized staffing, our revenues
will also be increasingly less driven by market fluctuations, strengthening our cash generative profile that
has a strong track record of through-the-market resilience and margin expansion.

Our resilience is further supported by the ‘‘cash protective’’ nature of our working capital dynamics. Our
working capital largely consists of receivables (client billings) and payables (job candidate wages, social
security, etc.) tied to individual job candidate placements. For each job candidate placement, the
receivable is higher than the payable with the difference roughly representing the bill-pay spread or gross
margin embedded in the client service agreements and job candidate agreements. This means that (all else
being equal) when we place less job candidates, our working capital declines, resulting in a positive cash
balance offsetting the loss of post-tax cash profit.

Working capital as a percentage of sales, per September 30, 2020, was 2.2% of sales, compared to 3.9% per
December 31, 2019 (in each case, on an LTM basis). Given that our October 2020 and November 2020
revenues were, respectively, 91.3% and 94.0% of our revenues in the same months in 2019, our working
capital requirements for 2020 have already been largely absorbed in the Group’s cash balance as of today,
resulting in no decrease of available cash. For a graphic demonstrating the trends in our monthly revenues,
please refer to the section above entitled ‘‘—Our Strengths—We operate exclusively in attractive markets that
_are well positioned for future growth.’’ The working capital dynamics and corresponding downside protection_
for our cash flows are also evident in our recent performance, which has been impacted by the Covid-19
crisis. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key
_factors affecting our results of operations—General economic conditions—Germany’’. The following chart_
shows our working capital for each month of 2020 as a percentage of sales (on an LTM basis) and

Note: Numbers in A millions.

**_Entrepreneurial management team with a long term incentive culture._**

We benefit from a strong and committed management team that is highly motivated to deliver strong
performance over the long term. More than 170 managers among our management team and individual
platform managers collectively own 18.1% of our equity as of the date hereof, via tracking shares that are
linked to the performance of their business units or investments in our long-term incentive plan at our
Group level, as well as over 400 managers whose interests are aligned to the Group via our Long-Term
Incentive Plans (LTIPs).

We believe our successful organic and external growth has been due in part to the way in which we have
been able to incentivize our managers. For example, our organic ‘‘cell division’’ expansion strategy rewards
our local managers with the opportunity to create and run individual branches, fostering loyalty and
encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit that has delivered our success to date. For our engineering and
consulting branches, our variable pay structure rewards management down to the sales and recruitment
consultants with variable pay linked to key performance indicators such as attracting, matching and
retaining job candidates and clients.

As part of the long-term incentive plan of the Group, Leaver situations may occur. Every year, one Leaver
event is foreseen based on the audited results of the year before. In this respect, a share buyback was
finalized in 2020 relating to departing management for A35.3 million, plus an accrued dividend coupon of
A2.2 million. This was completed on October 23, 2020 (with a remaining A0.8 million to be paid out in
2021).

Our variable bonus systems are intended to encourage growth and bonuses. Variable pay, consisting of
cash incentives and equity participation for our CEO and CFO, represents 50% to 60% of our CEO and
CFO’s salary package and is tied to performance targets at the Group level, such as sales revenue,
EBITDA, EBITDA growth, and equity value of the Group. Furthermore, variable pay can represent up to
50% of the salary package for other employees in our Group, including the management of our business
units, branch managers, sales consultants and recruitment consultants. See ‘‘Our Business—Employees—
_Employee compensation’’ for more information._

-----

Furthermore, when we have grown by acquisition, we have offered an appealing value proposition to
managers of the businesses we acquire by allowing these individuals to retain autonomy over their
respective entities’ operations, including brand and identity, while allowing them to benefit from central
Group support on complex regulatory and compliance topics, access to our foreign sourcing network and
digital platforms and the possibility to leverage credit lines at the Group level. We also offer such managers
an incentive structure tied to, where possible, both their own company’s and the overall Group’s results.
Additionally, there is a long term incentive plan at our Group level. We believe that this streamlines the
integration process and helps to align the management of our acquisition targets with our central
management. We also believe that our long term incentive plan allows for succession planning for key roles
by incentivizing key staff to remain with our Group and by enabling potential reinvestments in the equity of
the Issuer going forward.

Finally, our decentralized model, with nine business units, has proven to be extremely efficient when
managing during a crisis. Each operating company has the perfect knowledge of their own (end) market,
local measures to be benefited from, behavior of its own population and employees, reaction of local
competitors and was therefore able to act accordingly and proportionally to the economic situation of their
own geography. Weekly video calls were conducted to update each other on the effects of the pandemic,
government measures, ideas to boost sales and keep motivation of employees high, and enabled quick
adoption of best practices throughout the group and across operating companies. We benefited from each
other’s creativity, which included initiatives like providing a Covid-19 bonus as well as targets and speed
bonuses.

**_Conclusion_**


We believe we are unique among our peers as a result of our strengths outlined above and that this is
reflected in our performance ahead of certain of our competitors. Based on information available, we
believe that organic growth was 2% to 7% and EBITDA margin was 5% to 12% on average per annum
from 2014 to 2017 among competitors in our Total Market. During this same period, our organic growth
and EBITDA margin typically performed above the Total Market average. For an illustration of our
Organic Growth and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA performance against our competitors, a comparison of
our Organic Growth to the normalized revenue and EBITDA performance of companies including
Randstad, Adecco and Manpower for the periods indicated is presented below.

**Our Strategy**

Our aim is to become the number one European provider of specialized human resources solutions to
SMEs. We intend to achieve this through pursuing the following strategies:

**_Make use of agile decentralized operating model to spur quick recovery and further focus on organic growth_**
**_by grasping additional market share while maintaining best-in-class profitability_**

Our decentralized model has demonstrated that it enables a quick reaction during times where fast and
tailor made decision making is needed in the different geographies and end-markets were are located in.
Both in terms of temporary closing offices, reopening offices with reduced staffing, making sure all
required materials and processes were in place (e.g. hand gels, screens, disinfecting alcohols, necessary
cleaning, grocery shopping for foreign workers, quarantine measures, and local testing). All operating
entities also tailored sales and prospection targets, enabling a very fast rebound post lockdown situations.
This has resulted in a fast recovery of revenue numbers. With the second lockdown still ongoing, it is clear
that again now, the different operating entities were able to take the right measures fit to the current
situation, resulting in a much milder decrease in revenue. Once lockdown measures are over and vaccines
are wide spread, we believe that we are well positioned to restart our track record of organic growth
through our branch development model and through continuing to target growth markets. Over the years
pre-Covid-19, we have been highly successful in achieving incremental organic revenue growth under our
‘‘cell division’’ approach, particularly in our specialized staffing and general staffing segments, where our
branch network is key, and through our ability to attract and retain job candidates for assignments in
sectors where candidates are scarce. We intend to continue to benefit from this through expanding our
branch network where needed and continuing to leverage our success in sourcing and retaining job
candidates, and focusing on those job profiles which are and will be increasingly scarce in the market. In
most of our markets we expect to continue our strategy of embedding ourselves in local communities
through an extensive branch network, which places us in proximity to our primary stakeholders: our clients,
our job candidates and our own employees. We also believe our extensive branch network approach leads
to enhanced entrepreneurship and ownership due to the managerial responsibilities and opportunities
allocated or available to branch managers, reinforcing a key part of our values. We further aim to deliver
continued improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin through a shift in our services mix (including
through increasing the relative weight of the specialized staffing and engineering and consulting services
we provide in our overall mix), as well as continued efficient cost control over operating expense and
strong cash conversion with rigorous management of capital expenditures and working capital.

**_Focus on profitable specialized and niche end-markets._**

Over time, we expect to gradually shift our focus toward the engineering and consulting and specialized
staffing model from general staffing, leveraging our growing network in the transition to deliver higher
margins. The specialized staffing and engineering and consulting segments tend to deliver higher margins
than general staffing due to the premium clients place on successful placement of the specific job
candidates that they seek, and we intend to leverage our positive track record in these segments to
continue growing profitably. Moreover, specialization aims to target those segments and skills that are
more difficult to find for our customers, which in the past has provided more stability to our revenue
figures, including during economic downturns.

**_Enhance our reputation as the partner of choice for SMEs and locally managed clients._**

We intend to continue providing critical end-to-end temporary recruiting and outsourcing services that are
tailored to the needs of SMEs and other locally managed clients. We believe that in the future these clients
will continue to require the assistance of providers like us as they grapple with limited resources, lower
visibility on staffing needs and greater need for outsourced HR functions, including as a result of the
complexity of labor law and associated regulations. We aim to be a one-stop shop for such clients that can
help at all stages of the recruiting process to relieve our clients’ management from the burden of having to
seek appropriate job candidates for available positions. In doing so, we plan on leveraging the large pool of
potential job candidates at our disposal, the deep end-market knowledge we have gathered over the years
through having boots on the ground in proximity to our clients.

141


-----

**_Ensure the smooth and profitable placement of job candidates with a reliable sourcing and reskilling platform._**

Mastering the ‘‘human’’ aspect of human resources is key to success in our industry and we intend to
continue to be a leader through our focus being able to source the right job candidate for the right
position, including through offering reskilling services. We believe that our network of international
sourcing of job candidates is vital to our success, as we are better able to bridge the large gap between the
demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates, especially as the labor market in
our addressable markets has tightened over the past few years, through having access to a wider pool of
quality job candidates than our peers. The location of our agencies (particularly in Poland, Romania,
Spain, the Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal) and the support we offer to foreign job candidates
(including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance) ensures
that we are able to tap into workforces that are skilled but that are eager to seek out opportunities to earn
higher wages than those that similar work would provide in their home countries. We intend to continue to
develop our network in other countries that meet these criteria. We also plan to continue leveraging our
large sourcing network to target the best job candidates and provide them with a wide array of positions
and support, including training, administrative support, client knowledge and even transport and housing
for foreign job candidates, in order to make their experience as smooth as possible. Finally, we plan to
focus on preparing job candidates for what we see as the jobs of tomorrow, such as white-collar positions in
big data and information technology, that are being driven by the digitalization of the economy or provide
trainings in order to teach blue-collar job candidates how to use digital tools.

**_Utilize digital initiatives to reduce cost and drive revenue diversification._**

Our digital strategy is focused on maximizing the impact of digital cost reduction initiatives, outpacing
smaller competitors who have more limited investment capabilities and opening new market segments.

In the short run, we want to leverage digital tools to complement our physical networks to attract job
candidates and clients while also spreading awareness of our brands and services. We also intend to
continue digitalizing our processes to drive efficiency.

Over the longer term, we intend to pursue a four-pillared digital strategy. First, we aim to reposition the
offices we have in urban areas into ‘‘JobShops’’ that are easy to reach, convenient, one-stop shops where
job candidates can be tested, get certifications and be matched with potential positions. We also are
continuing to develop niche, specialized platforms that are tailored to meet the specific demands of the
various markets we address. Further, we intend to utilize the data that we have generated through our
large network to deliver the best possible client and job candidate service. Finally, we plan to develop more
automated processes to free up our recruiting consultants’ time for them to focus on growing ever closer to
our client and job candidate base. In this respect throughout 2019/2020 both Continu and Covebo moved
to the Connexys software. In Gritt, better measurement tools and KPI reporting systems were introduced,
to further automate and improve recruitment and placement statistics. In Accent, mobile forms are fully
digitized and OCR is introduced, capturing data from physical documents such as passports and driver’s
licenses, immediately in the candidate or customer files.

**_Target accretive acquisition opportunities to achieve European leadership._**

While our primary focus is to grow our earnings base organically and to improve both profitability and
Normalized _Pro Forma Free Cash Flow generation through our existing network and customer base, we_
will continue to consider accretive and strategic platform and bolt-on acquisitions in both new and existing
markets to achieve our goal of European leadership. We do not consider acquisition opportunities aimed
at turning around a business but only will consider opportunities that can reinforce our market positions or
expand our footprint, either in new geographical regions or niche areas in which we currently are not
present and that show the following attributes: stable economies with low unemployment, high salaries,
high temporary staff penetration and supply and demand mismatch for skilled labor. We will also consider
opportunities in digital tools that can improve the value chain or allow us to better serve job candidates as
well as clients and to develop new and complementary segments that are also marked by labor market
scarcity or that can demonstrate the prospect for high growth and superior margins. We will continue to
use our M&A assessment criteria, which requires that any opportunity meets our own high quality
standards, holds a leading position in its respective specialized end-market, reflects a strong financial
profile and represents a good cultural fit with us. For the years to come and with the financing obtained,
the focus of acquisitions will be on highly specialized businesses, business focusing on bottleneck jobs and
engineering and consulting services. While we historically have focused on bolt-on acquisitions that can

142


-----

enhance our network and/or provide us with exposure to complementary sectors of the economy, such as
the additions for ‘Stevin’ and ‘Riviera’ for which we recently signed share purchase agreements, we also
occasionally consider larger acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our investment criteria.We are
also targeting certain new end-markets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals and new geographic
markets such as the Nordic countries.

**Business Model**

Our business units serve as the intermediaries between job candidates (supply) and the client requiring
staffing solutions (demand). Our in-house employees include sales, marketing and recruiting staff, who
work to attract job candidates to our business units and to maintain and build new client relationships with
those who have HR staffing needs. We refer to ‘‘job candidates’’ as those individuals that we recruit or who
come to us seeking work and who are placed with clients, which includes consultants and engineers in our
engineering and consulting segment, as well as freelancers that are placed with clients by us. Our in-house
employees match job candidates to the HR needs of our clients. Some of our business units also screen and
recruit freelancers, particularly in specialist areas with high job shortages or where flexible work
arrangements are preferred, and certain of our business units also engage in search and selection services
in order to recruit highly specialized job candidates.

We will typically enter into an employment agreement with the job candidate and a service agreement with
the client. The employment agreement is often entered into with the job candidate in connection with us
entering into a service agreement with the client. In these cases the employment agreement is for the
duration of a particular client assignment, which duration will vary a great deal among our business units
due to the nature of the services offered and will also be impacted by the nature of the services required by
the client. However, the employment agreement in a number of our business units, primarily those in our
engineering and consulting segment, will often be an indefinite employment agreement and for a longer
duration than the service agreement with the client as a result of regulatory reasons or to facilitate
recruiting job candidates.

Nearly all of the service agreements into which we enter with clients are time and materials service
agreements, which means we are compensated under the contract for the services and materials provided
by our job candidates. A small number of the service agreements we enter into with clients are projectoriented, which means we are compensated under the agreement only when our job candidates deliver the
project in accordance with the specifications in the agreement.

When we have a time and materials service agreement with a client, we typically bill the client for the
services performed by the job candidate and pay the salary and the applicable associated benefits, fees and
costs, such as social security, of the job candidate. The difference between what we bill our clients and what
we pay as salary, benefits and associated costs to the job candidates is referred to as the ‘‘bill-pay spread’’,
which is a key driver of our Group’s profitability. Our business units are organized around a variety of
staffing models which have varying degrees of specialization and scarcity, which impacts the bill-pay
spread. We also focus on providing best-in class service, matching excellence and investing in digital
initiatives to enhance our service offering as well as to automate processes and reduce costs to maximize
the bill-pay spread. Other elements that are part of our business model include a focus on SME clients
(who often lack in-house staff who can perform the staffing services that we provide), providing training to
our job candidates and including non-solicitation or minimum fees for a particular period for job
candidates in relation to the client for which they are staffed. For further information about the pricing of
our job candidates in our service agreements with clients, see ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key factors affecting our results of operations’’._

The nature of the employment agreement into which we enter with job candidates and its duration
(whether it is an open ended contract for the length of an assignment or an indefinite contract that is in
place whether or not the job candidate is on an assignment) will depend primarily upon the regulatory
environment in which our business units operate (see ‘‘Regulation’’) and the type of contract needed to
attract, recruit and retain job candidates. The nature of the employment agreement will also impact the
termination and notice periods. Indefinite contracts typically provide for three to six month notice periods
for us to terminate the employment agreement. The flexibility of open ended contracts typically allows us
to enter into an employment agreement with the job candidate in connection with an assignment with a
client and the notice periods in the service agreement will be aligned with those in the employment
agreement. On the other hand, as a result of the indefinite employment agreements, we experience ‘‘bench
time’’, which is the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a client assignment, for

143


-----

our job candidates with indefinite contracts. However, we carefully monitor the end date of all such job
candidates’ assignments and aim to line up the next assignment before their current one comes to an end
to minimize bench time. By minimizing a job candidate’s bench time, we aim to ensure job candidates are
being utilized on billable matters and generating revenue since we will be responsible for the costs
associated with employing them whether or not they are on assignment with a client.

In our engineering and consulting segment, employment agreements with job candidates are typically
indefinite due to the regulatory environment of the countries in which our business units in this staffing
segment operate or in order to attract and retain job candidates to fill staffing shortages. In certain
business units, such as Redmore, the employment agreement approach also facilitates longer and more
specialized training to job candidates and deepens the relationship between ourselves and these job
candidates. Within this segment, we also utilize a number of freelance job candidates (approximately 12%
of job candidates at work), primarily in the Gritt (formerly TEC Alliance), Redmore and Vialegis business
units, whom we screen and match with clients but who do not become our employees. In our specialized
staffing segment, due to the countries in which our business units in this segment offer services and our
ability to attract and recruit job candidates, we typically use open ended contracts with job candidates. In
our general staffing segment, which is primarily based in Germany and due to regulations on temporary
staffing there, we generally enter into an indefinite employment agreement with a job candidate. As a
result, our generalized staffing segment also faces bench time risk with respect to their job candidates.
However, the bench time risk in this segment is typically less than that in the engineering and consulting
segment due to the lower costs of services typically associated with these job candidates and the typically
shorter notice periods required for our job candidates in this segment as compared to the engineering and
consulting segment.

**The Recruiting Lifecycle: Facilitating Supply and Demand**

The recruiting lifecycle, which refers to the sourcing of job candidates, the identification of clients who
require our specialized HR solutions for particular jobs and then the subsequent matching, on-boarding
and payment or billing of such work, is a fundamental part of the operations of each of our business units.
Each of our business units is focused on the full spectrum of the recruiting lifecycle, which we describe in
more detail below. We also seek to align our in-house employees’ incentives, including sales and recruiting
teams, with the Group’s financial performance, with for example approximately 20% of the Accent
business unit’s salaries being variable performance-based compensation as at December 31, 2019, which we
believe is higher than the industry’s average variable performance-based compensation.

**_Supply: Job Candidates_**

The following describes the typical elements of the recruiting lifecycle and the role we play in relation to
job candidates:

- **_Sourcing: Our business units define the job candidate requirements through their knowledge of_**
relevant end-markets, the needs of clients and, if applicable, any specific client requirements provided,
and then identify potential job candidates. We source job candidates through databases, our presence
at schools, universities and on job boards, as well as through training for the skilling or reskilling of job
candidates. We also make use of foreign recruiting networks in certain of our business units, such as
Accent, Covebo, TimePartner and Zaquensis and have started exploring this possibility also for
Abylsen.

- **_Assessing: We assess job candidates by checking their education and skills (with additional assessment_**
for more specialized roles) and certify their capabilities.

- **_Matching: To match job candidates to clients’ opportunities we check their fit with the job position_**
and company, including their mobility and availability for the location and duration of the assignment.
We then match a job candidate to a client and seek to ensure the job candidate has a good
understanding of the job and its requirements. Certain of our business units will also make use of the
digital initiatives we have to facilitate the matching process, such as AI enabled speech-to-text tools
and our SWOP application. See ‘‘—Three Staffing Segments and Digital—Digital Initiatives—Matching
_technology’’._

- **_Administrative management: We prepare the contract with the job candidate, whose terms may vary_**
based on the business unit and the type of placement with which the job candidate is matched, and we
provide other administrative support throughout the assignment, including, for example, the

144


-----

management of vacation day requests. We also follow up to ensure smooth contract signatures are
obtained initially and then upon renewal, if desired.

- **_On-boarding: We present the job candidate to the client, guiding him/her through interviews. We also_**
follow up with job candidates in certain placements, such as within the engineering and consulting
segment, after candidates are placed in order to check their satisfaction with the client and the
assignment, whether the matching was accurate and to further understand any further wishes or
objectives of the job candidate. Also job candidates, especially in the engineering and consulting
segment, are trained to fit certain job or project specific tasks.

- **_Payroll: We use digital timesheets and validate the timesheets, to facilitate the correct payment of job_**
candidates’ salaries.

**_Demand: the client and its HR staffing needs_**

The following describes the typical elements of the recruiting lifecycle and the role we play in relation to
the client’s HR staffing needs:

**_Selling:_** We manage existing client accounts, identify potential clients and generate leads on clients’
staffing needs.

**_Publishing:_** We discuss general requirements with clients to gain an understanding of specific job
requirements and the required job candidates for such a job, and then publish offers via our business units
(including on their own websites), third-party applications or social media.

**_Matching:_** We identify and present a short list of eligible job candidates for the position to the client and
organize meetings and interviews with the job candidates. Some of our business units also use our digital
initiatives, such as NOWJOBS, which allows job candidates to be matched to clients, though we often
monitor our digital initiatives in order to facilitate the matching and engage with the job candidates and
clients when needed.

**_Administrative management:_** We prepare the service agreement between ourselves and the client. In some
placements, we can also provide clients with replacement staff, if needed, for any vacation days taken by
job candidates while on assignment.

**_Invoicing:_** We use timesheets and validate those timesheets to provide correct and transparent invoicing
to clients, with certain of our staffing solutions utilizing digital timesheets. We can also manage the
different legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate for clients, including the payment of
payroll taxes and other withholdings.

**_After-sales:_** We follow up with clients after on-boarding job candidates to check if the matching was
accurate and to assess the client’s satisfaction with the job candidate and the recruiting process.

**_Our International Recruiting Network_**

As mentioned above, certain of our business units also utilize their international recruiting networks to
source job candidates. We believe that best practice for job candidate sourcing from international markets
is managed through foreign recruiting-dedicated teams in local foreign offices which are joined up with
foreign recruiting teams in host countries to identify clients with long-outstanding vacancies. A foreign
recruiting team with a presence in both countries can then offer a full-service proposition to the customer
covering all steps from sourcing and recruiting to on-boarding and payroll. We also believe Covebo and
Accent reflect best practice by having job candidate integration teams in the host countries which are
dedicated to placing and monitoring foreign workers, providing in-house training and offering other
comprehensive services to assist with their integration (support in finding housing, health, transport, tax
assistance and possibly host country language support). We also utilize some digital tools to recruit in
foreign countries, such as our Happy Recruiter digital initiative in Romania, which is a chatbot, or a
computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, that can recruit job candidates
through Facebook. The employment of foreign workers as our job candidates is conducted according to the
receiving country’s legal framework. See ‘‘Regulation’’ for information about the regulatory environment in
each of our primary geographic markets.

**_Geographic Presence of the Group’s Staffing Segments_**

Our clients’ HR staffing needs are typically local, requiring HR staffing for such clients’ local business
location(s). For most of our business units, having branches close to our clients and job candidates is
important to being able to find and match job candidates. As a result, our business units typically have a
number of existing branches spread throughout the applicable geographic regions and focus on building
scale and density by opening new branches throughout these areas in order to be closer to job candidates

and clients. See ‘‘—Our Strengths —Outstanding record of organic and external growth’’ for more
information.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our sales in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France
represented approximately 37%, 33%, 22% and 8%, respectively, of our Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue. For
a map showing the locations of our Group’s geographic locations by our three staffing segments and our
international recruiting network as at September 30, 2020, please see ‘‘—Our Strengths—We benefit from a
_focus on specific end-markets and scarcity-driven job candidate profiles.’’_

Information about the number of branches that we operate in each of our three segment staffing levels, as
well as certain information about the branches operated by our principal business units, is provided below.

**Engineering and Consulting**

Our engineering and consulting segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu, Vialegis and Redmore
business units and the Gritt business unit (which includes TEC and Logi-technic), as well as ibb and
AERO, which are sub-business units of TimePartner. Abylsen, Redmore and Continu are the largest
financial contributors to this segment and revenue from the business units in this segment generate
revenue from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Belgium. The figures below show the
split of our engineering and consulting segment’s sales by brand and by geographic market, respectively,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Note Figures are calculated on the basis of the business unit accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Gritt
Projects has been excluded from the perimeter, as it was divested in 2020. Sales by brand are calculated on the basis of
business unit accounts or subunits, in the case AERO and ibb. Sales by geographic market primarily allocate revenue from
the business units accounts to the primary geographic market of that business unit, though some adjustments for revenue
generated in other geographies have been reflected when possible. As a result, the percentage of sales by geographic market
will not align with figures provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our business units in this segment typically provide medium to highly skilled job candidates who are
engineers, technicians or other white-collar consultants to clients from a diversified range of end-markets,
with the greatest concentration of clients typically being from the finance and industry end-markets, and a
sizeable number coming from the construction, aerospace and defense end-markets. The job candidate
placements by the business units in this segment are typically medium- to long-term. Unlike our other
segments, which typically generate most or more than half of their sales from SME or intermediate sized
clients, the business units in our engineering and consulting segment are more mixed in the percentage of
clients that generate sales, with the percentage of sales from SMEs or intermediate companies often
representing less than 50% of sales for Abylsen and Redmore, with nearly all of AERO’s clients being
larger corporates.

The job candidates in most of our engineering and consulting business units are our indefinite employees
on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. As a result, our engineering and
consulting segment in particular carefully monitors the end date of all job candidates’ assignments and
aims to line up the next assignment before their current ones come to an end. This monitoring seeks to
minimize ‘‘bench time’’, which is the time during which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a
client assignment.

As at September 30, 2020, our engineering and consulting segment served customers through a business
unit network of 92 branches, with 941 in-house full-time equivalent employees and 5,884 job candidates at

**_Abylsen_**

Abylsen is an engineering and consulting business unit headquartered in France, with operations in France,
Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Abylsen operates in a competitive but fragmented market, where it
is a relatively small company which challenges primarily large global consulting or mid-sized global
companies or brands, as well as regional companies or brands.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

We provide engineering and technology consulting services to clients, with the majority of sales revenue
from clients being from blue-chip or larger medium-sized companies. However, we also have a strong focus
on SME clients. In terms of end-market, Abylsen is a multi-specialist business unit providing engineering
graduates to a wide range of end-markets. The three largest end-markets served by Abylsen’s engineers are
automotive, industry and pharmaceutical, though we also served a number of clients in energy, transport,
aeronautics and defense and IT. Abylsen also serves these industries via its sub-brands Pharmacos, Pharma
Insights (PI), Belgatech and Mykelson.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

The business unit has a strong focus on balancing talent hiring and retention with wage control and
turnover. Furthermore, it uses engineers to recruit and match engineering job candidates to clients and to
provide in-house employees with end-market and job specialization and understanding.

The service agreements Abylsen enters into with clients will vary from client to client depending on their
end-market and staffing needs. For example, Abylsen also provided one of our clients, a leading
pharmaceuticals company, with a team to monitor the remediation of emergency lighting defects across
their expansive facilities.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

As at September 30, 2020, Abylsen had 29 branches, 246 in house full time equivalent employees and 1,613
engineers at work with different expertise (including mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering). For
the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Abylsen had revenues of A98.5 million. The substantial
majority of the business unit’s revenue is generated in France, with the remainder of sales primarily being
generated in Belgium. Bench time was at 4.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

**_Redmore_**

Redmore is a provider of specialized secondment and consulting services in our engineering and consulting
segment headquartered in the Netherlands, with operations in the Netherlands, Poland and a newly
opened international branch in Spain. We typically provide consulting and secondment services to clients
through job candidates with university degrees or applied university degrees who are predominantly but
not exclusively on indefinite term contracts with us. Redmore’s business unit and its brands operate in
competitive, often niche, markets, with each of its brands being connected to relatively small companies,
with competitors of a variety of sizes, including large global companies and the ‘‘Big Four’’ accountancy
firms.

Redmore has four complementary brands: Talent&Pro, Triple A Risk Finance, Profource and ITDS and
three ‘start-up’ brands of which 2 are spin-offs within existing brands:

- **_Talent&Pro is Redmore’s largest brand and focuses on secondment of its own job candidates for the_**
Dutch financial end-market who are either on indefinite term contracts with us, temporary personnel
or freelancers (whom we have screened and assessed);

- **_Triple A Risk Finance provides consulting services in the area of actuary and risk management services_**
and job candidates placed by Triple A Risk Finance ordinarily have actuarial and risk managements
backgrounds;

- **_Profource provides secondment and consulting services through our job candidates who are specialized_**
in optimizing finance processes, the execution of enterprise resource planning-related assignments
and business processes outsourcing; and

- **_ITDS provides specialist consulting for insurance companies, pension funds and banks._**

- **_Finalize is sub-brand of Profource specializing in SAP functional consulting for corporates and_**
government institutions.

- **_House of Beta combines the former two business lines of Talent & Pro, being ‘actuarial’ and ‘business IT’._**
These new business lines are offering to the existing customers, but increasing access to candidates by
opening branches near the STEM (Beta) universities of Eindhoven and Delft.

- **_Ctrl-F is the business line in which all search and selection activities for customers take place._**

_End-markets served and contract framework_

The majority of Redmore’s revenue comes from large corporates. However, revenue from SMEs and
intermediate sized enterprises also contribute a significant portion of our overall revenue. In terms
end-market, Redmore is a specialist business unit providing financial consulting services to end-markets
including insurance, banking, government and health, as well as to other corporates.

The Redmore business unit, through its four sub-business unit brands, is primarily engaged on time and
material contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 95% of the contracts for the brands in
Redmore’s business unit were time and material contracts. Based on our periodic assessment of our
contracts, we estimate that a typical service agreement between these brands and a client will be a time and
materials contract for an average duration of five to twelve months. Furthermore, our job candidates in the
Redmore business unit are typically employees on our payroll with an indefinite contract, meaning that
bench time may occur. As a result, this is a metric which is carefully monitored. Redmore also monitors the
chargeability of its job candidates since a number of its job candidates, primarily in its consulting services,
will be engaged periodically on non-chargeable activities such as training or pre-sale activities, which are
expected to benefit the business unit’s sales in the long-run, but will result in periods where job candidates
are not generating revenue for the business unit.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

The business unit has a strong focus on training, coaching and evaluating its job candidates and placing
them in assignments that develop their skills through experience. We typically recruit young professionals
and provide training to them over their years of employment with us as job candidates to develop their
financial expertise. The business unit also offers an in-house academy with certifications and qualifications,
knowledge and competency frameworks to attract and retain job candidates and to develop them with
increasing market value for its clients. For many of the assignments for which our business units’ job
candidates are eligible, their market value (the bill value we can charge), increases more quickly than the

149


-----

salary requirements (the payment we make to job candidates), which contributes to the bill-pay spread and
our Group’s profitability.

The service agreements that each of the brands under Redmore enters into with clients will vary from
client to client depending on a number of factors including their end-market and staffing needs. Examples
of service agreements entered into by each of Redmore’s brands are provided below:

- Talent&Pro provided a team of job candidates, comprising of a mix of junior and senior job
candidates, to one of our clients, a European Insurer and Bank, to fulfil their need for compliance
professionals for a Customer Due Diligence Enhancement project. Talent&Pro placed 53 job
candidates throughout 2020 and an additional 31 candidates starting the December 1 in Talent&Pro’s
Business Process Outsourcing division. This agreement is expected to amount to A3.5 million in
revenue for 2020.

- Profource provided job candidates to one of our clients, a major international airport. The candidates
achieved a transformation of all finance processes and implementation of Oracle Cloud ERP.
Profource placed twelve job candidates and this agreement generated revenue of approximately
A1.2 million.

- ITDS was asked by one of our clients, a major international insurance provider, to assist with their
implementation of Data Management. In 2020, we placed eleven job candidates and this service
agreement brought in a revenue of approximately A1.0 million.

- Triple A—Risk Finance developed an application (Uniforme Reken Methodiek ‘‘URM’’), that was
delivered as SaaS solution to our clients to perform regulatory required calculations. The year to day
revenue in 2020 is A700 thousand. Triple A—Risk Finance was selected by the Dutch regulator to
provide consultancy services, as part of our framework agreement, to develop a methodology used by
the regulator Finally, Triple A—Risk Finance was selected by several insurance companies to help
implement IFRS17. At two major Dutch insurance companies, Triple A—Risk Finance placed 15 job
candidates at each company.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

As at September 30, 2020, Redmore had eleven offices, with 178 in-house full-time equivalent employees
and 1,463 job candidates at work. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Redmore had revenues
of A109.4 million. Nearly all of the business unit’s revenue is generated in the Netherlands. Bench time was
at 3.2% during the same period.

**_Continu_**

Continu is a specialist in finding white-collar secondment solutions for the engineering and construction
markets in our engineering and consulting segment. It is headquartered in the Netherlands, with branches
throughout the Netherlands, two branches in Belgium and a branch in Germany that was opened at the
beginning of 2019. Continu provides secondment solutions to clients through job candidates who are
planners, foremen, superintendents, technical designers, project managers, architects and a wide variety of
engineers such as in manufacturing, research and development, and mechanical.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

The substantial majority of sales revenue from clients comes from SME and intermediate sized enterprises.
In terms of end-markets, Continu was a mono-specialist business unit providing secondment services
towards the construction end-market, but has been diversifying its services to include the industrial, civil
and mechanical engineering end-markets. It has also increased its specialization within the construction
end-market through its acquisition of MT&V, which is focused on social housing and with the acquisition
of Techmatch in January 2020, also on technical profiles.

The Continu business unit is primarily engaged on time and material contracts, with a focus on
assignments that provide opportunities for temporary placements to lead to permanent positions, or
‘‘temp-to-perm’’. Continu’s exposure to bench time is limited due to its use of back-to-back contracts
(meaning a contract is entered into between us and the job candidate in connection with a secondment or
other staffing assignment with a client for the same duration) and short notice periods towards seconded
job candidates. Furthermore, since 2016, Continu has been a member of the Algemene Bond
Uitzendondernemeningen (the ‘‘ABU’’), which means the applicable CLA is the ABU CLA. This permits

150


-----

Continu to enter into multiple consecutive temporary contracts within five years with an employee (as
opposed to three under provisions applicable to it before joining the ABU) and has also allowed Continu
to offer longer duration contracts. See ‘‘Regulation’’ for further information. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, 95% of contracts for the brands in Continu’s business unit were time and material
contracts, with a typical service agreement between Continu and a client being for an average duration of
twelve months.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

Continu’s business units provide nationwide coverage through the Netherlands, offering a high degree of
specialization through its job candidates. The business unit is recognized among the Group for its best
practices with respect to job candidate retention, providing regular touch points with job candidates
throughout their candidate journey, starting from first contact through to satisfaction surveys while on
assignment, as well as scheduled touch points to recognize and celebrate key events such as signing a
contract and the job candidate’s birthday.

The service agreements Continu enters into with clients will vary from client to client depending on their
end-market and their staffing needs. For instance, Continu placed 78 job candidates at the world’s leading
lithography company which generated approximately A2.5 million in revenue. Continu also provided
various job candidates to one of our clients, a multi-product specialist offering a range of engineering
components and technical services. These job candidates filled planner, draughtsman, service coordinator
and manager roles. Continu placed eight job candidates and this agreement generated approximately
A0.2 million in revenue. Continu also placed nine job candidates at one of our clients, a European
construction-services business. We also placed nine of our job candidates in engineering and construction
roles as well as a sales manager on premises. This engagement brought in approximately A4.8 million in
revenue.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

As at September 30, 2020, Continu had 24 branches, with 239 in-house full-time equivalents and 1,348 job
candidates at work. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Continu had revenues of
A75.7 million, including the recent acquisition of Techmatch. Nearly all of the business unit’s sales revenue
is generated in the Netherlands. Due to the open ended contracts and short notice periods possible with
Continu’s job candidates, bench time is not a primary key performance indicator for this business unit.

**_Other Business Units and Sub-Business Units of the Engineering and Consulting Segment_**

Our engineering and consulting segment also includes the Gritt business unit (which includes TEC and
Logi-technic), ibb and AERO (which are engineering and consulting sub-business units of TimePartner
which is in the generalized staffing segment), and the Vialegis business unit which provides legal staffing
solutions. Sales from the Gritt and Vialegis business units contributed 16% and 3% of the engineering and
consulting segment’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the AERO and ibb
subunits together contributed 8% of the engineering and consulting segment’s revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020.

**Specialized Staffing**

Our specialized staffing segment is comprised of our Accent and Covebo business units, with operations in
Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively, as well as branches in countries that form part of their
international recruiting networks. The specialized staffing segment provides temporary staffing solutions
with a focus on ‘‘temp-to-perm’’ placements, international job candidate recruiting and permanent
placements for clients who need specific job profiles. The figures below show the split of our specialized

business units accounts to the primary geographic market of that business unit, though some adjustments for revenue
generated in other geographies have been reflected when possible. As a result, the percentage of sales by geographic market
will not align with figures provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our business units in this segment typically provide low-to-medium skilled job candidates who are mostly
from technical backgrounds to clients from a diversified group of end-markets, with the greatest
concentration of clients typically being from the construction, industry, retail and food end-markets, and a
sizeable number coming from the technical and logistics end-markets. The job candidate placements by the
business units in this segment are typically short to medium-term.

As at September 30, 2020, our specialized staffing segment served customers through its business units’
networks of 346 branches, with 1,499 in-house full-time equivalent employees and 28,585 job candidates at
work. The following table shows these and other key financial performance indicators and operating
metrics for this segment for and as at the periods indicated:

**_Accent_**

Accent is a specialized staffing business unit focused exclusively on the Belgian specialty market, with
operations in Belgium and offices in Poland, Romania, Moldova and Portugal for the sourcing of job
candidates from its international recruiting network. Accent operates in a competitive and consolidated
market where it challenges larger global staffing solutions companies or brands, as well as regional
companies or brands.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

Accent focuses on the more sustainable and profitable ‘temp-to-perm’ contracts, with a focus on different
niches and with a strong network of local branches, specialized to serving a specific type of job candidate
profile and client end-markets. Nearly all of the sales revenue from this business unit comes from SMEs or
intermediate sized enterprises who value speed and flexibility, a close customer-relationship and who are
willing to pay a premium for Accent’s services, therefore quality over quantity. In terms of end-markets,
Accent provides primarily blue-collar job candidates, of whom approximately 24% are foreign workers, to
a wide range of end-markets. The three largest end-markets served by Accent’s job candidates are the
construction, retail and manufacturing end-markets, though our job candidates also serve a number of
clients in the services and transport markets.

Accent is mostly engaged on time and material contracts, with a focus on ‘‘temp-to-perm’’ assignments.
Pursuant to temporary worker legislation in Belgium, Accent is typically able to align its job candidates’
contract durations with its clients’ contract duration, resulting in no exposure to bench time. See
‘‘Regulation’’. For the year ended December 31, 2019, nearly all of Accent’s contracts were time and
material contracts, with an average duration of 40 days. Since 2018, Accent has also begun to offer search
and selection services which are invoiced on a fee basis, which are primarily provided through its Ctrl-F
brand and supported by an internal ‘digital talent hunter’ recruitment team.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

The business unit has a strong focus on developing best practice practices for a fast-yet-high-quality
candidate and client matching, driven by strong digital initiatives for which Accent is being recognized as a
pioneer in the market. Since assignments are typically for a relatively short duration, being able to quickly
match a job candidate and client quickly is important. Accent combines strong intimacy in the front with a
strong efficiency in the back.

Accent assisted one of our clients, a sanitaryware wholesaler with its on-going demand to find temporary
job candidates and then hire them as permanent employees by co-creating a website for applicants and
helped to coordinate the required education for future sanitary technicians.

Accent also assisted one of our clients, a sanitaryware wholesaler, with the ongoing demand of its B2B
customers to find temporary job candidates and then hire them as permanent employees by co-creating a
website for applicants and helped to coordinate the required education for future sanitary technicians. We
already placed 15 job candidates at 9 different companies in only 4 months and this ongoing agreement
already brought in A144,209 in revenue in 2020.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

As at September 30, 2020, Accent had 313 branches, which branches reflect teams dedicated to specific
specialty job candidates, 886 full-time equivalent employees and client end-markets and 19,929 job
candidates at work. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Accent had revenue of A313.9 million.
Nearly all of the business unit’s sales revenue is generated in Belgium.

**_Covebo_**

Covebo is a blue-collar specialized staffing business unit. It is focused on the Dutch specialty blue-collar
staffing market, with operations in the Netherlands, as well as its branches in Spain, Poland and Romania,
which are part of its international recruiting network. It also has a cooperative agreement with our
Zaquensis business unit in Germany under which Zaquensis covers the payroll of Covebo’s job candidates
on assignment with clients in Germany.

-----

_End-markets served and contract framework_

Covebo focuses on temporary staffing for two primary end-markets: (1) construction and technical,
including technical, construction and infrastructure jobs; and (2) production and logistics, including food,
logistics and industry jobs. Nearly all of the sales revenue from this business unit comes from SMEs or
intermediate sized enterprises, with certain exceptions relating to larger clients in the production and
logistics end-market and within Eurojob. Covebo provides blue-collar job candidates to its clients, of which
typically approximately 80% are foreign workers. The most frequent end-markets served by Covebo’s job
candidates are the food production, logistics, engineering and construction and infrastructure end-markets.
Via its acquisition Eurojob, Covebo now also handles the logistics for the retail segment. Covebo intends to
try a start-up for nursing profiles.

Through its digital initiative Fygi, Covebo is training own staff. Independent freelancers will become
recruiters for mostly white collar profiles at different companies, by using Covebo’s digital tools and
platforms. Covebo takes a commission on the revenue generated by these freelancers. Revenue of this
initiative for the nine months ending September 30, 2020 was A1.9 million.

Nearly all of Covebo’s contracts are typically flexible contracts, meaning that Covebo is not obligated to
pay any temporary job candidate not engaged in billable work for up to the first 78 weeks (depending on
the employment agreement entered into with such job candidate), with discretionary temporary
employment agreements permitted to be entered into (with up to a maximum of six employment
agreements) over the next four years thereafter. Covebo’s exposure to bench time is thus limited due to the
regulatory framework and their ability to use of flexible contracts with job candidates. Some job candidates
placed by Covebo are freelancers, especially in the VNOM offices of Covebo. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, the substantial majority of Covebo’s service agreements with clients were time and
material contracts, with an average of five job candidates per client, with an average duration of
approximately 40 weeks.

Covebo Energy was launched at Covebo. Covebo New Energy is specialized in mediating technicians in the
sustainable industry. Think of solar panel technicians, insulation technicians, electric charging station
technicians, air & heat pump technicians, windmill technicians and technicians who specialize in other new
energy sources.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

Covebo was one of the first dedicated blue-collar foreign recruiting based staffing companies in the
Netherlands. It offers a full-service foreign recruiting process for job candidates and clients by facilitating
and organizing housing, transportation and insurance (including health insurance) and offering social
guidance and support. In 2018, Covebo launched an in-house education program to support its full-service
proposition which offers foreign job candidates education on Dutch tools, materials and ways of working.
The program trains and tests candidates on various skills such as masonry, plumbing, electrics and
painting. It also facilitates quick onboarding since job candidates have been assessed as part of the training
program and familiarized with customer-specific standards.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

As at September 30, 2020, Covebo had 5,226 beds for job candidates, 1,051 cars for foreign temps and
5,377 health insurance policies for its foreign temporary job candidates.

As at September 30, 2020, Covebo had 33 branches, 603 full-time equivalent employees, 12 international
recruiting offices and over 8,544 job candidates at work. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
Covebo had revenue of A252.5 million. Nearly all of the business unit’s sales revenue is generated in the
Netherlands.

**General Staffing**

Our general staffing segment is comprised of our TimePartner and Zaquensis business units (with the
exception of the sub-business units in TimePartner that are part of our engineering and consulting
segment). TimePartner and Zaquensis provide staffing solutions in Germany, which together we estimate
are among the top three staffing solutions by sales for blue-collar workers in Germany, and have expanding
international recruiting networks. The general staffing segment provides mostly short-term staffing
solutions to larger clients which have multiple staffing needs. The staffing is often provided to help clients

manage seasonal peaks, vacation time or temporary leaves of absence. This segment provides staffing both
with and without on-site management.

The figures below show the split of our general staffing segment’s revenue by brand and by geographic
market, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020:

###### General staffing General staffing

Note Figures are calculated on the basis of the business unit accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Sales by
brand calculated on the basis of business unit accounts. Sales by geographic market primarily allocate revenue from the
business units accounts to the primary geographic market of that business unit, though some adjustments for revenue
generated in other geographies have been reflected when possible. As a result, the percentage of sales by geographic market
will not align with figures provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) ibb and AERO are part of the TimePartner business unit and revenue on a business unit basis includes these figures; however,
revenue from these subunits are accounted for as part of our engineering and consulting segment.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

Our business units in this segment typically provide low- to medium-skilled job candidates who are from
general backgrounds to clients from a diversified group of end-markets, with the greatest concentration of
clients typically being from the industry, logistics, construction, aviation, food and automotive end-markets.
The job candidate placements by the business units in this segment are typically short to medium-term
(with a maximum duration of 18 months), unless agreed otherwise by company unions (approximately
48 months)). The contract framework for temp employees are indefinite duration, making it a core task for
Timepartner & Zaquensis to perfectly match the job assignments with the contract duration, making sure
the (very short) notice period corresponds to the remaining duration of the assignments.

Using the cell division model, we wish to specialize or expand our branches in the German market,
potentially using a different brand for its specialized and general staffing model, and operating as one
platform.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

In our general staffing segment, clients particularly value: the ability to place job candidates quickly
(particularly for short-term staffing needs), quality candidate pools, assistance and peace of mind regarding
our ability to help them comply with and navigate complicated regulatory and compliance landscapes, and
good value for money. Additionally, but to a lesser extent, customers are using our competence as a
recruiting partner or as a master vendor, managing all their temporary workforce.

Our job candidates in our general staffing segment are often looking for an HR staffing company that can
find them a job quickly, treat them well, provide opportunities for clients to take them on as permanent
employees and have a good pool of local job opportunities. Our general staffing segment facilitates these
interests from clients and job candidates by having good industry knowledge in the markets that we serve,
making decisions quickly, having a quality pool of candidates available (and working with our international
recruiting network, where needed, to ensure we can help staff shortages) and job candidates for
management positions with good experience and skills.

_Financial performance and Other operating metrics_

The key profitability drivers for our general staffing segment are the number of hours worked by our job
candidates, our market penetration, the temporary staffing market (which is impacted by the number of

155

|General staffing Zaquensis 30% Timepartner 70%|General staffing Germany 100%|
|---|---|


-----

local branches we have) and the billing rates that can be achieved. Furthermore, our general staffing
business units in particular have been impacted by changes and reforms in Germany’s temporary staffing
laws and regulations which have resulted in changes that have increased and decreased market demand for
our services. See ‘‘Regulation—Germany’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—We are subject to extensive laws and regulations
_which may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may reduce our future earnings.’’ for further_
information.

As at September 30, 2020, our general staffing segment served customers through its business units’
networks of 158 branches, with 555 in-house full-time equivalent employees and 11,354 job candidates at
work. The following table shows these and other key financial performance indicators and operating
metrics for this segment for and as at the periods indicated:

**Digital Initiatives**

We develop digital initiatives with a dual purpose: to support growth initiatives for our operations by
enabling us to reach additional job candidates or serve new end-markets, and to introduce cost efficiencies
to our processes to remain competitive against technological developments. By producing tools for our
business units to meet business needs where no applicable tool exists, we aim to disrupt the existing staffing
market and to expand our market share by developing new solutions or end-markets. Our digital initiatives
are typically not directly revenue generating, with the exception of NOWJOBS and GIGHOUSE, but
instead indirectly contribute to revenue generation by assisting us with identifying additional job
candidates or matching them with clients. Such initiatives can also help us reduce our expenses by
automating or introducing other time efficiencies into certain time-intensive aspects of the recruiting
lifecycle. Once a digital initiative has been developed and tested, it is typically launched by one of our
business units. Any revenue generated by the digital initiative, whether directly or indirectly, would be
accounted for as part of the revenue of the staffing unit to which the business unit belongs.

Our central unit development team is responsible for most of our digital initiatives and we strive to keep
the team lean and operationally independent, which we believe promotes an entrepreneurial, start-up-like
culture within the team. Re-usability of our developments is key, so applications can be exchanged across
different geographies and our operating companies. We have in the past and expect in the future to use
acquisitions as another means to acquire additional digital technologies that will complement our digital
initiatives strategy. Currently we are developing three technology stacks central to our digital initiatives

strategy: (1) mobile technology, (2) chatbot technology and (3) matching technology, including through AI
technologies.

**_Mobile technology_**

Our Group is strategically committed to mobile-based recruiting solutions to reach a larger pool of
potential candidates and increase user engagement. We have several live projects, including the following
mobile apps:

- **_SWOP: Inspired by Tinder, SWOP provides a mobile platform for job candidates to ‘‘swipe right’’ to_**
indicate interest on job opportunities they wish to pursue. SWOP was downloaded 24,878 times in
2018 and 13,663 times in 2019. SWOP has enabled the placement of 62 job candidates per month on
average until November 30, 2020. The app was updated early 2020 in order to include not only Accent
or Ctrl-F vacancies, but also include vacancies that are scraped from other companies, thus allowing to
show more than 30,000 vacancies in the Belgian market. Candidates swiping on non-Accent vacancies
are also contacted in order to help provide them with the necessary support if they do wish so.

- **_NOWJOBS: NOWJOBS is a mobile platform aimed at reaching student job candidates, historically a_**
difficult market to serve due to low margins. By implementing a mobile, app-based platform,
NOWJOBS has matched over 6,000 active companies with more than 280,000 job candidates in 2019
on a low cost basis for our Accent business unit. NOWJOBS was launched in the Netherlands end
2019 and will be launched post-Covid-19 in France. Since NOWJOBS mostly services the
entertainment, hospitality and retail segment, it was heavily impacted during the lockdown period. It
has shifted its offering now also towards home delivery models, such as Take-Away.com and Hello
Fresh.

- **_GIGHOUSE: GIGHOUSE is a mobile app designed to reach freelance or independent job candidates_**
and match them with clients. We add value by screening the freelance or independent job candidates
to check their qualifications and experience to provide a narrower pool of suitable options for clients.

- **_FYGI: FYGI is a mobile platform that connects freelance recruiters to Covebo’s staffing network and_**
job candidate pool on a commission basis. FYGI focuses on providing freelance recruiters access to a
larger pool of potential job candidates than they would independently be able to access in order to fill
permanent positions.

Additionally, we have a full team dedicated to creating a Group framework for each business unit to
develop tailored mobile solutions for its end-markets and hold a minority stake in Ariad N.V., a digital
consultancy and staffing firm.

We have also developed CV Creator, a service which allows job seekers to create professional r´esum´es
quickly and easily. CV Creator is available as a free web service today, and we are planning to integrate it
into our mobile apps at a later stage.

**_Chatbot technology_**

Through our recent investment in Happy Recruiter, we have developed Dora, the recruitment robot, a
chatbot that automatically searches, screens and nurtures candidates on social media. Dora speaks 7
languages and can search and screen candidates everywhere in Europe. Dora held over 700,000 interviews.
This technology helps find passive and active job candidates and creates efficiency in the reaching and
screening process.

**_Matching technology_**

Matching candidates to open positions is a critical component to our business and we are developing
solutions to optimize the matching processes using data analysis and AI. Such matching technology
projects focus on improving the quality of the data, including by encouraging individuals to update their
information directly on our platforms. Additionally, we are developing and experimenting with AI-enabled
speech-to-text tools, including for the MyAccent, an app that is connected with Google Assistant (for
instance via smartphone or Google Home) to engage in a job search. By converting the job candidate’s
speech into text on such platforms, we will be able to develop and test methods to automatically detect job
candidates’ skills, interests and personality traits, which we can then match to appropriate job
opportunities. These initiatives aim to increase the quality and efficiency of matching and to identify skill
set needs in order to develop appropriate training. Together with the Ghent University we developed soft

skills testings, to allow candidates to discover their personal preferences as to type of companies they wish
to work for or as to their own personality.

**M&A Process and Criteria**

M&A has been a key strategic pillar to strengthen our Group, reinforce our market positions, enter new
market segments and countries, achieve above market growth and profitability and reinforce the offerings
of our business units. Between 2015 and 2017, we added the Abylsen, Covebo, Continu, TimePartner,
Vialegis and Redmore business units to the Group, acquired a stake in Zaquensis and merged Human
Capital Group SA with Logic-Technic to create our minority stake in the TEC Alliance Group (now our
Gritt business unit). Since that time, we obtained control over the Zaquensis Group and the TEC Alliance
Group. In 2019 and 2020 we mainly focused on bolt-on acquisitions to enhance the platforms of our
existing business units. Bolt-ons allow our business units to either expand geographically or gain expertise
in a certain end-market or job profiles. The market value of our Addressable Market for our existing HR
solutions in the primary geographies and end markets in which we currently operate was estimated at
A35 billion in 2017, comprising A12 billion for the engineering and consulting market, A8 billion for the
specialized staffing markets and A15 billion for the general staffing market. Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, the
market value of our Addressable Market was expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6% from
2017 through 2023. We believe that such growth is to be expected in the future, although with a delay due
to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, driven by the long term underlying trends mentioned above, and that
we are poised to continue growing at or above the industry average growth rate in the future. See
‘‘—History’’ and ‘‘—Our Strategy—Target accretive acquisition opportunities to achieve European leadership.’’
for further information about our history and our current M&A strategy, respectively.

We have built and follow a structured process to assess M&A opportunities, from deal sourcing to support
for newly acquired companies, which are supported by our in-house capabilities. We also believe our
approach to M&A has created an attractive value proposition for company owners at target companies and
contributed to our success in closing M&A opportunities that we identify.

Our typical selection criteria, M&A assessment and integration process, value proposition and our current
M&A activity, are described further below.

**_Selection criteria_**

We use an initial set of criteria to identify targets. These criteria examine the historic growth, geographic
location, staffing segments, growth and margin prospects, end-market specialization and cultural fit to
investigate M&A opportunities. Targets that are determined not to fit the selection criteria are eliminated
from consideration.

Our criteria include:

- **_Geographic location: We look for targets in countries that have a high salary level, high staffing_**
penetration and a stable regulatory environment. Our current key areas of focus include countries
where we are already present, particularly Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg
and Switzerland, as well as new geographic or other development areas, including Austria, the Nordic
countries and targets in other countries where the target offers digital technology that complements
our strategy.

- **_Staffing segment: We look for targets in mainly the engineering, consulting and specialized staffing_**
segments. The focus for Germany today is on specialized staffing targets. By targeting the same
staffing segments as our business units, we can reinforce their expertise areas or geographic coverage
through bolt-on acquisitions.

- **_Growth and margin prospects: We seek targets where we see above-market growth and margin_**
prospects. To that end, we look for targets (1) offering specialist services, focusing on attractive
specialties, which we believe drives higher price points for services (see ‘‘—End-market Specialization’’
below), (2) having competitive positioning with a high relative market share and demonstrated track
record and experience and (3) displaying operational excellence with well-structured commercial
processes, lean cost structures and entrepreneurial ability.

158


-----

- **_End-market specialization: We look for targets that are staffing end-markets with significant levels of job_**
shortages. Currently, the core end-markets we believe face such shortages include engineering,
financial services, IT, pharmaceuticals and healthcare. Furthermore, our current operations in
Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands provide HR solutions that meet most of the top critical job
shortages in those markets. In terms of specializations that we currently do not have, in Belgium and
the Netherlands we have identified nursing and healthcare. These are specializations that we may
develop to fill our specialization gaps and meet the critical job shortages in those geographic markets
but also acquisitions may be one way to move into these end-market specializations. We also consider
opportunistic acquisitions of targets that do not serve these end-markets, but which show high growth
and margin prospects.

- **_Cultural fit: We look for targets that have like-minded management teams. Since our Group operates in_**
a people business, finding targets that are a good cultural fit is critical.

- **_Valuation: Historically, we have acquired bolt-on acquisitions in the range of 5x to 8x, and platform_**
acquisitions in the range of 8x to 9x LTM EBITDA.

**_M&A assessment and integration process_**

Our structured process helps us identify opportunities, investigate and assess the targets that meet our
selection criteria and support the target company once it has been acquired. Three levels of our
organization are involved in deal sourcing: our central Group; our business units; and our shareholders.
Each level evaluates opportunities through the rubric of our selection criteria. Opportunities identified
which meet the selection criteria are considered on a weekly basis via the M&A team and are then
evaluated by our investment committee and an opportunities file is maintained. Our investment committee
includes representatives from each of the three constituencies (our central Group, our operating
companies, our sponsor, Naxicap, and other shareholders with greater than 1% of voting rights). To further
assess an opportunity that meets our selection criteria and undertake due diligence, we typically sign a
non-binding letter of intent and then undertake due diligence on the target and prepare a short file that
summarizes our assessment of the target company, its market and its key financial and other metrics. The
investment committee will evaluate the opportunities and, if recommended, they are presented to our
Board for a go/no go decision. Opportunities may be approved or rejected, or the Board may recommend
that more time needs to be taken for further assessment. If approved, we will submit a binding offer and
determine which entity in the Group will acquire the target. Typically for deals that are closely related to
one of our business units, the acquisition will be undertaken by that business unit, with deals less closely
related or very large being acquired at the central Group level. The assessment process from initial
sourcing to closing takes an average of six to nine months to complete.

Once a deal closes, our central support team assists acquired companies. The central team provides
performance support by sharing best practices, financial guidelines and reporting templates and assists
with regulatory compliance issues. The time required to integrate the target into our Group varies
depending on the size of the target, but typically takes six to nine months from closing. Financial
integration is prioritized and is typically completed within 90 days of closing.

**_Our value proposition for target company owners_**

We believe our approach to M&A has created an attractive value proposition for company owners at target
companies which have contributed to our M&A track record. We believe four aspects of our M&A
approach contribute to our appeal to targets and our track record at closing transactions where we have
submitted a binding offer:

- **_Financial incentives: In transactions that took place prior to 2018, we often acquired only a stake in the_**
target company, which allowed target owners to retain an ownership interest in the target once it
became one of our business units (if acquired as a new platform). However, as part of our 2018 legal
reorganization, we modified our M&A approach and introduced tracking shares whose performance
is tied to a business unit or other operating company in respect of acquisitions taking place in 2018
and subsequently. We may also grant our ordinary shares to align incentives with the performance of
our Group as a whole. This equity type of ownership allows us to continue to align the incentives of
those at the business unit level with both the performance of our Group and their individual business
unit. For smaller acquisitions we may continue to acquire only a stake in the target company, but
immediately include a mechanism to roll-over shares at group level, exchanging local shares for
ordinary & tracking shares.

- **_Operational freedom: For platform acquisitions that are broadening our base of services offered, we_**
typically offer target companies the option of retaining their full autonomy at the level of their entities
operations. We also typically preserve the brand identity of the acquired companies, which are not
consumed into the House of HR brand or the brand of any business unit. Bolt-on acquisitions may
retain less operational autonomy, depending on the nature of the acquisition and how it is integrated
into our Group, but we also typically preserve their identity and branding.

- **_Support on critical issues: Companies joining the Group benefit from support on complex regulatory_**
and compliance topics from our central teams. These companies are also provided with access to our
foreign staffing recruiting network and experience, our digital platforms (though they may require
adaptation and implementation for their local markets) and the possibility of accessing our credit lines
at a Group level.

- **_Our reputation: We are a leading company for specialized HR solutions with a strong Organic Growth_**
track record and a reputation for operational excellence. We also have a track record of successful
acquisitions.

**_Current M&A activity_**

The following current M&A activity is being undertaken by the Group, as at the date of this Offering
Memorandum:

- we have signed two Share Purchase Agreements for two, separate bolt-on acquisitions of majority
stakes (each with minority reinvestment) of engineering and consulting businesses (i) in the
Netherlands, by Continu; and (ii) in France, by Abylsen. These transactions are expected to close in
January 2021;

- we are participating in a competitive tender for a majority stake (with minority reinvestment) in a new
specialty business in Germany. If our tender is successful, this transaction would be expected to be
signed and closed in the first half of 2021; and

- We have issued a non-binding offer to participate in a capital increase of a small tech venture,
providing video technology for vacancies and candidates of up to A1.8 million.

These targets were identified and selected in line with our selection criteria and our M&A strategy. See
‘‘Summary—Acquisitions.’’

**Properties**

We have properties located strategically across the markets in which we operate. As at September 30, 2020,
we had 954 property leases, which includes our headquarters, our business units’ branch office networks in
the host countries we serve, our international recruiting network’s recruiting offices where we source
foreign job candidates, as well as our leases for housing that we provide to certain in-house employees or
job candidates. The location and breadth of our business units’ branch networks vary by business unit and
geographic location, but generally support our candidate recruiting and client-facing services.

Our Group’s headquarters is located in Roeselare, Belgium (the ‘‘Headquarters’’). The property at our
Headquarters has three components: (1) the land on which the office buildings are located; (2) the land on
which the parking lot is located; and (3) the office buildings built on the land. We have a 50% ownership
interest over both the land for the office buildings and the land for the parking lots. The other owner of
such land is Pro-Serve Software en Advies BVBA (‘‘Pro-Serve’’). With respect to the office buildings built
on our land, the builder of our office building, Fortis Lease NV (‘‘Fortis’’), owns the building right to the
building and we lease it from Fortis, along with other lessees. At the end of the building right period on
April 1, 2030, ownership of the building will pass to ourselves and Pro-Serve without any additional
expense.

_Employee compensation_

Up to 50% of the total compensation of our business unit managers, branch managers, sales consultants,
and recruitment consultants is variable and linked to performance:

- **_Business unit management: The performance targets for business unit managers are generally tied to_**
business unit level KPIs, such as business unit EBITDA, EBITDA growth, new clients, people at work
and productivity. Additionally, managers at the business unit level are often entitled to participate in
equity compensation schemes at the Group level, which links their compensation to the performance
of the Group as a whole.

- **_Branch managers: The performance targets for branch managers are generally tied to branch level_**
KPIs, such as new clients, people at work and productivity. Branch managers are compensated with
bonus cash incentives, and successful achievement of KPI targets often impacts promotion decisions.

- **_Sales consultants: The performance targets for sales consultants are generally tied to individual sales_**
KPIs, such as the number of daily sales, customer calls, customer visits, customer offers, prospects
offers, new customers, and total active customers. Sales consultants are compensated with bonus cash
incentives, and successful achievement of KPI targets often impacts promotion decisions.
Additionally, top performing sales consultants may have the opportunity to open new branches.

- **_Recruitment consultants: The performance targets for recruitment consultants are generally tied to_**
individual recruiting KPIs, such as the number of candidate calls, candidate interviews, and successful
placements. Recruitment consultants are compensated with bonus cash incentives, and successful
achievement of KPI targets often impacts promotion decisions. Additionally, the top performing
recruitment consultants may have the opportunity to open new branches.

Additionally, managers at the Group level receive substantial performance-based compensation. See
‘‘Summary—Our Strengths—Entrepreneurial management team with a long term incentive culture.’’ for more
information.

We believe that our emphasis on performance-based compensation contributes to an entrepreneurial
culture throughout the Group and aligns the incentives of our business unit-level employees with that of
the central Group.

**Intellectual Property and Brands**

We use a variety of trade names, trademarks (including for word, figurative and combined marks) and
domain names in our business. Due to the Group’s acquisition history and organizational approach, the
Group’s intellectual property portfolio is mainly held, maintained and monitored by our business units or
their subsidiary undertakings at the local level. The Group’s intellectual property portfolio includes
trademarks and domain names primarily registered in Benelux and the EU, as well as other registrations to
cover certain other local jurisdictions where one of our business units or its subsidiary undertakings
operate. We do not market our services under a House of HR brand but, instead our business units have
their own brands which are used to market their specialized services. As a result, the most important
trademarks and domain registrations to our business are those associated with the brand names of our
business units:

- **_Abylsen, which uses the Abylsen, Pharmacos, Belgatech, Mykelson and PI brands;_**

- **_Accent, which uses the Accent Jobs, Accent Construct and Ctrl-F brands;_**

161


-----

- **_Continu, which uses the Continu, MT&V, Hartd. and Technmatch brands;_**

- **_Covebo, which uses the Covebo, VNOM, Eurojob, FYGI and Effect brands;_**

- **_Redmore, which uses the Talent&Pro, Triple A Risk Finance, Profource, ITDS, House of Beta, Ctrl-F_**
and Finalize brands;

- **_TimePartner, which uses the TimePartner, ibb and AERO HighProfessionals brands;_**

- **_Gritt (previously Tec), which uses the ETA, Tec and Logi-technic brands;_**

- **_Vialegis, which uses the Vialegis, Iterlegis and Schollmeyer & Steidl brands; and_**

- **_Zaquensis, which uses the ZAQUENSIS brand._**

Other brands being used are: NOWJOBS (an app for instant staffing of temporary jobs in hotels,
restaurants, caf´es, retail, events, sales and administrative positions), GIGHOUSE (a community where
freelancers and projects live together), CV Creator (a website to create professional r´esum´es quickly and
easy), MyAccent (an app allowing potential job candidates to interact via the Google Home assistant with
Accent’s list of open positions), Book’u (a planning tool that allows customers to plan both their
permanent and temporary workforce in one solution) and Softskillz.

We are currently in the process of centralizing the majority of our intellectual property by transferring
ownership thereof to a single Group company, House of Invest, in order to centralize ownership on a
corporate level and to facilitate integration and synergies across the Group, as well as partnerships with
third parties in the futures, especially in relation to digital initiatives.

In addition, certain of our business units use proprietary software applications which have been developed
or acquired by us. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as
contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and our proprietary
technology within such applications. While none of these applications is currently material to our business,
we expect that they will become more important to our operations as our digital initiatives grow and
become more embedded into our HR solutions.

See ‘‘Risk Factors—Our business may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property
_rights on which our business depends or if we are subject to claims of intellectual property infringement.’’._

**Marketing, Communication and Digital**

Our marketing teams operate on both the Group and local business unit level. Our Group’s marketing
efforts are led by our Group’s chief marketing officer. Each of our business units typically has its own chief
executive officer and/or marketing manager lead its local marketing initiatives. The role of our Group chief
marketing officer is to facilitate the two-way exchange of information and best practices. Our Group chief
marketing officer is also responsible for guiding and training our local business units and for integrating
the Group’s experience in digital recruiting strategies into the practices of our business units. Moreover,
the Group chief marketing officer oversees press and public relations on a Group level and the
development of thought leadership strategies.

Our marketing team’s primary focus is to efficiently attract new job candidates and clients for our business
units. Each of our local business units also focuses on building brand awareness of its particular service
offering. We apply a four-channel approach to marketing:

- **_Our Own Websites: Our business units’ and sub-units’ own websites are a key aspect of our marketing_**
strategy. We use them to attract active jobseekers. Our Group marketing team provides trainings on
search engine optimization to enhance our ability to use the websites for marketing and sourcing job
candidates and clients.

- **_Commercial Jobsites: We also make use of commercial jobsites, including generalist sites, niche sites,_**
aggregators or Google for Jobs, to locate client opportunities for our job candidates, but have become
less reliant on them over time as we have developed our own search engine optimization capabilities
and digital initiatives.

- **_Social Media: We believe that social media is an important channel to reach out and source passive_**
jobseekers. LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram are core advertising platforms in our recruiting and
targeted advertising strategy. On Accent’s Facebook pages we had 55,390 likes as at September 2020,
which was two times more likes than those on Randstad, USG People or Adecco’s Facebook pages.

162


-----

- **_Digital Innovation: Our digital innovation initiatives have produced tools for our business units to fill_**
business needs where no applicable tool exists. We have developed apps such as SWOP, NOWJOBS,
FYGI, Book’U and MyAccent that have facilitated the efficient sourcing and matching of job
candidates to clients. We believe that these tools give our Group a competitive edge and help to
future-proof our recruiting strategy. See ‘‘Three Staffing Segments and Digital—Our Service
_Offering—Three Staffing Segments and Digital—Digital Initiatives’’ for further information._

We seek to maximize our total return on marketing spend by frequently analyzing and adjusting our budget
and chosen advertising channels to those that are most effective.

**Information Technology and Innovation**

Our Group’s IT capital expenditure budget for the year ended December 31, 2020 is approximately
A15.5 million. Our IT expenditure has increased in recent years in connection with our digital initiatives
strategy and the growing size of our operations, though we believe that our level of IT expenditure is still
below the industry average for the professional services sector, which we believe is due to our lower
expenses for the development of technology as a result of our in-house resources as well as the ability of
our business units to use a number of off-the-shelf IT solutions. Furthermore, since our job candidates
typically use our clients’ systems when they are on assignment, our IT systems are largely for the benefit of
our in-house employees.

Among our business units, the Accent business unit has the largest concentration of the Group’s IT assets
and employees, in large part due to Accent’s historical role as the original member of our Group and its
development team for the MyTools application, a proprietary ERP platform that executes a wide range of
functionalities supporting Accent’s business operations. Additionally, Accent’s IT staff also supports
services and applications that Accent provides to other business units in our Group. With respect to our
other business units, Covebo also employs an internal IT team, with the remaining business units largely
relying on external IT service providers for their IT needs. These and other third parties that we use
typically work alongside our business units or other Group entities under service level agreements, with
appropriate relationship management.

Our IT infrastructure is built around a focus on operating KPIs with systems at our business units largely
relying on off-the-shelf products and systems.

Our Group’s IT platform is organized around three pillars: data security and privacy; integration; and
innovation. A description of each of these pillars is provided below:

- **_Data security and privacy encompasses all processes and initiatives aimed at ensuring the security of our_**
Group’s IT infrastructure, the prevention of the loss of sensitive or private data and relevant
regulatory compliance.

- **_Integration encompasses all efficiency and cost-related initiatives, including identifying Group-wide_**
best practices and common infrastructure, software platforms and processes.

- **_Innovation encompasses the development of new technology and markets for the Group._**

**_Data Security and Privacy_**

We operate in countries with numerous data security and privacy laws. Our IT systems and processes are
critical to our business operations and strategy, and it is therefore imperative that we maintain policies and
procedures to comply with such laws, such as the GDPR. Our Group’s IT professionals implement systems
and practices to protect against the loss of sensitive or confidential information, for example through
running penetration and vulnerability testing on a periodic basis. Additionally, our Group’s IT
professionals run awareness campaigns aimed at embedding protection and security of information into
our operational business culture.

**_Integration_**

Our Group has undertaken several integration initiatives aimed at driving synergies across business units
and their constituent entities and creating efficiencies from economies of scale. We also maintain a set of
IT guidelines that relies on a mandatory/recommended/allowed (‘‘MRA’’) framework, which enables
operational flexibility for our business units while maintaining commonality across the Group where
critical. Under the MRA process, our IT managers discuss and identify a list of mandatory, recommended
and allowed applications, processes and technologies on a Group-wide basis. Mandatory items include, for

163


-----

instance, a common email platform, a disaster recovery plan and security-related software, such as
password vault and spam and phishing protection. This MRA process aims to lower operational costs,
improve price negotiation positions, enhance the IT support available across our Group and facilitate
synergies across business units. It also assists our business units with staying attuned to modern
applications and software advancements.

Our mandatory MRA guidelines require that each of our business units use at a minimum a Tier 3 data
center (which is a data center that provides redundancy, dual-powered servers, network links and other IT
components), with a strong recommendation to host our servers in the cloud. Our business units’ data
centers and backup are provided by several different providers, with a number of our business units and
the central Group using Proximus data centers located in Evere and Machelen, Belgium. An IT objective is
to consolidate our data centers on the cloud for the entire Group. Migration to the cloud by our Belgium
data centers is on-going and full migration of production servers towards Azure is planned by the end of
the first quarter of 2021. In addition, an updated data and cyber security program has been rolled out
throughout the group. As part of our data strategy a project to create a candidate data platform (CDP),
enhancing the candidate user experience, in Belgium which is intended to launch in 2021.

**_Innovation_**

We continue to improve and innovate our IT platforms, both within business units and across the Group.
We have one central unit for the Group which centralizes our digital expertise and competence. This
central unit focuses on how to digitize and deploy artificial intelligence (‘‘AI’’) in our core business and
experiments with new technologies. See‘‘—Our Service Offering—Three Staffing Segments and Digital—
_Digital Initiatives’’ for further information._

**Insurance**

The principal risks that we insure against are directors’ and officers’ liability, cyber, general third party
liability, general professional liability, employers’ liability, workers’ compensation, motor third party
liability, property damage and business interruption, with Accent, Covebo, TimePartner and Zaquensis
also holding credit insurance to protect their accounts receivables. Our directors’ and officers’ liability and
cyber insurance policies are centrally negotiated Group-wide policies, with the remainder being standalone
policies taken out entity by entity, except for the credit insurance coverage which is limited to the entities
noted above.

We are currently in the process of further consolidating our insurance programs on a Group-wide basis.
Credit insurance is fully consolidated at the group level. We have identified general liability and property
insurance policies as other policies to consolidate in the near-term. We believe these insurance
consolidation initiatives will optimize our insurance coverage. We maintain insurance in such amounts and
with such coverage and deductibles as we believe are adequate to cover the major risks of our business. We
cannot, however, assure you that all losses and liabilities that we may incur would be recoverable. See also
‘‘Risk Factors—Our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all the risks we face and, if we are no
_longer covered by our existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms_
_or at all.’’_

**Internal Audit and Risk Management**

We have developed an enterprise risk management and internal audit framework that is able to assess and
mitigate risks and offer value-added auditing by optimizing systems, processes and efficiencies. We have
established a Group audit committee, whose role is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight
responsibilities for financial reporting, internal controls, auditing and legal and regulatory compliance. We
have a governance and control charter signed by all business units in our Group, and have implemented
conflicts of interest management as well as critical incident policies and procedures at the Group level. The
Group is also in the process of rolling out an internal code of conduct, which will be launched in
2021.Additionally, we utilize an external and independent auditor, Ernst & Young, to execute a yearly
audit plan that reviews the effectiveness of our internal controls and risk management policies and
procedures.

**Legal Proceedings**

At any given time, we may be a party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising out of the
normal operations of our business. We do not expect any liability arising from any of our current legal
proceedings to have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or financial
position.

**REGULATION**

**Overview**

The European staffing solutions industry is regulated. The applicable laws and regulations vary for each
country. Staffing solutions providers are generally subject to one or more of the following types of
government regulation:

- regulation of the relationship between a staffing solutions provider and its job candidates;

- regulation of the relationship between a staffing solutions provider and its clients;

- registration, licensing, record keeping and reporting requirements;

- substantive limitations on the provider’s operations; and

- health and safety regulations.

In most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including Belgium, the Netherlands, France and
Germany, staffing solutions providers are considered the legal employers of their temporary employees. In
other jurisdictions, staffing solutions providers are not considered the direct legal employers of temporary
employees, but they still have the legal responsibility to collect taxes and social security deductions and
transmit such amounts to taxation authorities. Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and
regulations that apply in each of the countries in which we have significant operations.

In addition to applicable national laws and regulations, Directive 2008/104/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of November 19, 2008 on temporary agency work (the ‘‘Temporary Agency Work
**Directive’’) also regulates temporary agency work at the level of the European Union. The aim of the**
Temporary Agency Work Directive is notably to lay down a principle of non-discrimination and equal
treatment for job candidates in relation to the employees of the client as a general rule. It also sets clear
limits to prohibitions and restrictions that may be imposed on the use of temporary agency work, while also
setting common minimum standards for temporary agency work in the EU. The Temporary Agency Work
Directive stipulates that basic working and employment conditions of job candidates shall be, for the
duration of their assignment at a client, at least those that would apply if they had been recruited directly
by the client to hold the same position. The Temporary Agency Work Directive allows member states to
make exceptions to this principle of non-discrimination in the cases of job candidates assigned on the basis
of a permanent agreement and who continue to be paid in the time between assignments, and collective
agreements and assignments derogating from the principle while respecting the overall protection of
temporary agency workers. The Temporary Agency Work Directive has been transposed in national laws of
the EU Member States.

**Belgium**

In Belgium, secondment of staff is prohibited, except in specific cases provided by law. Secondment of staff
is defined as the situation in which the employer ‘‘lends out’’ its employees to a third party, using the
services of these employees and exercising part of an employer’s authority over the staffing solutions
provider’s employees by giving them instructions. Exceptions to this general prohibition include temporary
staffing (also called ‘‘temporary agency work’’), temporary outsourcing of employees and self-employed
workers (sometimes also called ‘‘consulting’’ or ‘‘secondment staffing’’), instructions relating to health and
safety issues and clear instructions that form part of the services agreement. These limited exceptions are
considered as authorized secondment of staff.

In the case of temporary staffing, a job candidate (the employee, also called ‘‘interim worker’’) is hired by a
staffing services provider (the employer) with the intention of being put at the disposal of a client of such
staffing services provider. The staffing solutions provider remains the sole legal employer, while
transferring the exercise of the actual employer’s authority to the client during the temporary assignment
(i.e. the client will give instructions to the job candidate with regard to the work to be carried out).
Conditions to the recruiting of job candidates for the purpose of putting them at the disposal of a client are
strictly defined and the working conditions of such job candidates are required by law to be similar to the
working conditions of the permanent employees of the client executing the same job. Temporary staffing is
mainly regulated by the Act of July 24, 1987 on Temporary Work, Interim Work and Secondment of
Employees to Users (as amended) (the ‘‘Act on Temporary Work’’), which implements the Temporary
Agency Work Directive. Specific rules on temporary staffing apply in some sectors, such as the
construction sector.

165


-----

**_Primary Regulatory Framework_**

There are four situations in which temporary staffing is authorized: (i) as a replacement for a permanent
worker; (ii) during temporary and exceptional peaks of work; (iii) execution of unusual work; and (iv) in
order to employ the job candidate as a permanent worker (insertion professionnelle/instroom). Temporary
staffing is prohibited when the client wants to replace a worker during a period of unemployment for
economic reasons, technical reasons or reasons relating to inclement weather conditions which render the
performance of work impossible, such as flooding, as well as during periods of strike or lockouts (for
example, a company can never hire job candidates to replace employees who are on strike or lockout).

_Permits or other authorizations_

In order to engage in temporary staffing, a staffing services provider is required to obtain and maintain
mandatory permits from each relevant regional authority within Belgium, which may have different
eligibility requirements and conditions. A staffing services provider must obtain a permit from each region
in which it wants to operate, even if its registered office is located in a different region in Belgium. Each
region also has specific rules to allow, under certain conditions, a staffing services provider which already
has a certification in one of the three regions of Belgium and wants to extend its activity nationally, to
automatically get the same permit in the other regions. Permits are generally given for a fixed period and
can be renewed.

_Contractual framework_

The employment of a temporary employee at a client requires the conclusion of two agreements before the
job candidate starts work for the client: a commercial agreement between the staffing services provider and
the client; and an employment agreement between the staffing services provider and the temporary
employee. These agreements must be in writing and must, at a minimum, contain certain mandatory terms.
The part of the agreement between the staffing services provider and the client containing such mandatory
terms must be disclosed in writing, before the start of the temporary employment, to the temporary
employee.

The maximum duration of the temporary staffing and the applicable procedure to follow both vary
according to the applicable scenario.

_Employment terms and compensation_

The compensation of a job candidate may not be less than the compensation to which such job candidate
would have been entitled had such job candidate been a regular permanent employee of the client. During
the period of temporary agency work, the job candidate has the same rights as permanent employees with
respect to access to the infrastructure and services of the client, unless different treatment is objectively
reasonable. Furthermore, the rules on working time that apply to the client also apply to the job candidate,
unless a specific exception is provided.

_Termination_

In general, if a staffing solutions provider wishes to terminate a fixed term employment agreement or an
employment agreement for a clearly defined assignment before the end of its term, it must pay the
dismissed interim worker termination compensation equal to the amount of salary due until the end of the
agreement. The amount of termination compensation due in such case however cannot exceed an amount
corresponding to two times the termination compensation that would have been due if the employment
agreement had been concluded for an indefinite period of time. This termination compensation is not due
for termination of an assignment by a client, provided that the staffing solutions provider redeploys the job
candidate to another client for the remaining period of the employment agreement under identical
working conditions and with an identical salary. For employment agreements entered into to replace a
permanent worker, the termination compensation due to the dismissed job candidate in the event of a
termination by the staffing solutions provider is equal to three months’ salary. This termination
compensation is not due if the termination is by the client, and provided that the staffing solutions provider
redeploys the dismissed job candidate to another client for three months under identical working
conditions and with an identical salary.

166


-----

_Liability for damages_

Under Belgian law, the client may be liable to a third party for damage suffered by such third party caused
by a fault of the temporary employee in the course of performing his activities for the client.

_Fines, penalties and other enforcements_

Civil, administrative and/or criminal penalties may be imposed in case of a breach of the prohibition of
secondment, including breach of the abovementioned conditions to conduct temporary staffing activities:

- potential nullity of the employment agreement between the employee and employer (or the staffing
solutions provider);

- the client and the job candidate are deemed to have entered into an employment agreement for an
indefinite duration. The job candidate concerned is however able to end this indefinite contract at any
time, without notice and without paying the client or the actual employer any compensation;

- the staffing solutions provider and the client are jointly liable for the payment of the social security
contributions, salary and benefits arising from the new employment agreement;

- the client is liable for any damage caused by the job candidate (based on article 1384 of the Belgian
Civil Code);

- administrative or criminal fines may be imposed on the staffing solutions provider and on the client, as
well as an operating ban. Fines are multiplied by the number of job candidates involved (maximum up
to 100).

_Health and safety obligations_

During the period in which the job candidate works for a client, the client is responsible for the
implementation of all rules on health and safety at the workplace. The client must guarantee the same
level of protection of a job candidate in terms of health of safety, as guaranteed to its regular permanent
employees. Before a job candidate starts working for a client, the client must provide the staffing solutions
provider with all necessary information on the required professional qualifications and conditions for the
job, as well as on the specific features of the work position. Before a job candidate starts working for a
client, the staffing solutions provider must consult the centralized database for temporary agency workers
to verify whether a job candidate has been declared able to work in the specific position or job concerned,
and the period of validity of the ability to work has not lapsed. The staffing solutions provider is also
responsible for vaccination obligations. The staffing solutions provider is also generally responsible for
obligations related to maternity protection (with some limited exceptions). Other health and safety
obligations lie with the client.

**_Other Regulatory Frameworks_**

Whereas most of our business is conducted in the regulatory framework outlined above, we are subject to
certain additional regulation based on the specific nature of the services we provide in each jurisdiction.
Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and regulations that apply to these services.

_Temporary outsourcing of employees_

Certain of our business units also conduct consulting and secondment staffing (‘‘temporary outsourcing’’)
activities in Belgium. As with temporary staffing, temporary outsourcing is not considered as prohibited
secondment when a number of strict legal rules are met. These rules are mainly set out in the Act on
Temporary Work. An agreement must be signed between a contractor (which would be the staffing
solutions provider) and a client to provide a certain service, perform a certain task or work on a specific
project, rather than the provision of staff (which could be considered a prohibited secondment), including
a detailed list of the instructions which the client may give to the temporary staff. Clients may indeed give
instructions to the temporary staff, provided that: (a) these instructions are defined in a written agreement
between the consulting agency (in our case, the staffing solutions provider) and the client, the instructions
do not erode the staffing company’s authority over its staff, and are communicated to the client’s works
council; or (b) these instructions relate to the client’s health and safety obligations.

As with temporary staffing, outsourcing is subject to strict rules. These rules are mainly set out in the Act
of July 24, 1987 on temporary work and interim work (as amended). Clients may give instructions to the

167


-----

consultant/job candidate, provided that: (a) these instructions are defined in a written agreement between
the consulting agency (in our case, the staffing solutions provider) and the client, the instructions do not
erode the staffing company’s authority over its staff, and are communicated to the client’s works council; or
(b) these instructions relate to the client’s health and safety obligations.

_Temporary outsourcing of self-employed workers_

Belgian law also allows for outsourcing self-employed workers or freelancers only when no party exercises
an employer’s authority over the worker. If the parties (incorrectly) qualify their relationship as an
independent relationship rather than an employment relationship, this can result in specific liabilities for
the party that is considered to be the employer in the event of a re-characterization of the self-employed
relationship into an employment relationship. Such a determination is made based on all factual
circumstances including the following four main criteria: the will of the parties as expressed in the
agreement, the level of freedom to organize working time, the level of freedom to organize work, and the
level of hierarchical control. For specific sectors (such as construction, transport, cleaning, security and
surveillance and agriculture), certain legal presumptions apply. Re-qualification criteria for Belgium are
set out in a Program Act of December 27, 2006 and as well as in case law.

_Search and selection services_

The staffing solutions provider may also use its pool of job candidates to provide recruitment services and
also arrange for initial placements. Regional authorities may have different eligibility requirements and
conditions to conduct search and selections services.

**Netherlands**

The description below sets out the current statutory framework governing temporary staffing in the
Netherlands.

**_Primary Regulatory Framework_**

Dutch law defines a ‘‘temporary agency agreement’’ as a special type of employment agreement under
article 7:690 of the Dutch Civil Code (‘‘DCC’’) whereby the employee is made available by the staffing
solutions provider (the employer) to a third party (the client) in the context of the employer’s business
activities, to perform work under the management and supervision of the third party. In effect, the law
states that the relationship between a staffing services provider and a temporary agency worker qualifies as
an employment agreement. In principle, there is no requirement for an agreement between the client and
the temporary employee. Under the current definition, as interpreted by the Dutch Supreme Court, both
the traditional forms of temporary agency work as well as payrolling qualify as temporary agency work.
However, for payrolling, there is a separate legal and contractual framework, as set out below under
‘‘Payrolling’’.

_Permits or other authorizations_

The SNA quality mark (SNA-keurmerk) is an accreditation for staffing solutions providers. This quality
mark is provided by the foundation Stichting Normering en Arbeid on the basis of two NEN standards:
NEN 4400-1 for Dutch companies and NEN 4400-2 for foreign companies. Although not mandatory for
staffing solutions providers to obtain the SNA quality mark, it is important in practice.

_Contractual framework_

In case of a temporary agency agreement, the staffing solutions provider has more flexibility in framing the
contractual relationship with the job candidate, including the possibility of applying more fixed term
contracts and of terminating the contract if the client retracts the assignment.

In addition to Dutch employment law, the largest temporary staffing organization in industry (the ‘‘ABU’’)
and the largest Dutch trade unions have agreed on a collective labor agreement for the temporary
employment agency industry (the ‘‘ABU CLA’’). The current ABU CLA is declared generally binding for
the sector until May 31, 2021, which means that it applies to all staffing solutions providers that fall within
its scope—irrespective of whether a staffing solutions provider is a member of the ABU. As of the date on
which ABU CLA will not be generally binding anymore (and unless a new ABU CLA is declared generally
binding as of such date), statutory provisions regarding the agreements prevail unless provisions more

168


-----

favorable than the ABU CLA provisions have been contractually incorporated into the temporary agency
agreement with the employee

In effect, the ABU CLA provides that, over three phases, as temporary agency workers are employed for
longer periods of time, the temporary agency worker gradually becomes entitled to more job security and
secondary benefits, such as a pension and training.

There is also another collective labour agreement for staffing solutions providers known as the NBBU
CLA. The NBBU CLA is not declared generally binding and only applies to staffing solutions providers
who are a member of NBBU, another employers’ organisation for the industry. Staffing solutions providers
who are a member of NBBU, are explicitly excluded from the scope of the ABU CLA. Although they are
formally still two different CLAs, the current ABU CLA and NBBU CLA contain substantively the same
employment terms and conditions.

In general, the DCC imposes restrictions on (i) the number of successive fixed term employment
agreements that the employer (in this case, staffing solutions provider) can enter into with an employee
and (ii) the total duration of such fixed term employment agreements. If an employer enters into more
than three successive fixed term employment agreements, or if the total duration of the successive fixed
term employment agreements is more than three years, the last fixed employment agreement is converted
into an indefinite term employment agreement by operation of law. This rule is referred to as the statutory
‘‘chain rule’’ (ketenregeling).

When an employment agreement qualifies as a temporary agency agreement, this has significant
implications for the statutory possibilities to maintain a ‘flexible’ employment relationship. By way of a
collective labor agreement, it is possible to deviate even further from the chain rule as follows:

(1) The maximum number of successive fixed term employment agreements is six (instead of three) and
the maximum total duration of such fixed term employment agreements is four years (instead of
three). In addition, the ABU CLA provides that the exemption from the chain rule for temporary
agency agreements is extended from 26 weeks to 78 weeks of employment. During the exemption
period, it is possible to enter into an indefinite number of fixed term employment agreements, and the
number and duration of the fixed term employment agreements during this period do not count
toward the maximum total number and duration.

In practice, the above means that a temporary agency agreement can be a ‘‘flexible’’ employment
relationship for a total of 5.5 years, with the first 1.5 years disapplying the chain rule and with a
temporary employment clause (as described below) and the next four years with up to six fixed term
employment agreements.

(2) Further, it is possible to agree on a written provision whereby the employment agreement between the
employee and the staffing solutions provider terminates by operation of law if the posting of the
employee at the client ends at the request of the client. This provision is referred to as the ‘‘temporary
employment clause’’ (uitzendbeding). The ABU CLA provides that such provision is valid during the
first 78 weeks instead of 26 weeks of employment.

_Employment terms and compensation_

An employee that is made available to a client is in principle entitled to receive the same basic employment
terms and conditions as the employees of the client working in the same or equivalent positions (article 8
of the Placement of Personnel by Intermediaries Act). The basic employment terms and conditions include
salary and other compensation, working hours and vacation entitlement. The ABU CLA validly limits the
number of compensatory elements that need to be applied. Variable compensation, for example, is
excluded. Limited exceptions apply for a so-called ‘allocation group’ (i.e. persons appointed by the
government as having a ‘distance to the labor market’ and persons without a basic qualification who will
follow qualifying training via the staffing solutions provider). These employees receive wages determined
by the staffing solutions provider in accordance with the ABU CLA.

Furthermore, after one year of employment on the basis of a so-called ‘on-call’ agreement (in short,
without a fixed number of working hours), temporary agency workers (and other on-call employees)
should be offered a fixed number of working hours that is the average of their working hours over the last
twelve months. In addition, in case of an ‘on-call’ agreement, employers are required to pay full
compensation if an assignment is altered within four days prior to commencement.

169


-----

_Termination_

A staffing solutions provider may terminate an employment agreement in principle (i) if the posting of the
employee with the client ends within the term of the temporary employment clause, if contractually
provided for, (ii) against the end of the employment agreement, subject to an advance notice of one month
or (iii) with permission from the employment insurance agency (UWV) or the cantonal court.

In general, if an employer wishes to terminate a fixed term employment agreement before the end of its
term or an indefinite term employment agreement, it must show that it has a reasonable ground for
termination and that the employee cannot be redeployed in another suitable position within the group
within a reasonable period of time.

Employees are entitled to a transitional payment upon termination of employment at the employer’s
initiative (which includes the non-renewal of a fixed term employment agreement at the employer’s
initiative).

_Liability for damages_

In principle, the staffing solutions provider may be liable towards a client for damage suffered by that
client caused by a fault of its temporary agency workers. However, typically, in (framework) service
agreements by and between the client and the staffing solutions provider, liability in this respect is borne by
the client.

_Fines, penalties or other enforcements_

The law does not provide specific penalties for non-compliance, other than in the field of occupational
safety and health. In addition, the Dutch Labor Inspectorate also enforces the application of the ‘‘wage
correlation norm’’. This norm prescribes that minimum standards and wage components should be applied
to temporary agency workers on par with regular employees in comparable positions.

_Health and safety obligations_

The staffing solutions provider is obliged to assure that it receives, and makes available, a hazard
identification and risk assessment (risico-inventarisatie en—evaluatie) from the client. Furthermore, the
staffing solutions provider is obliged to inform the temporary agency worker of the risks at the workplace.
In the event of non-compliance with these obligations, the staffing solutions provider may be liable towards
its temporary agency workers for damages as a result of inadequate working conditions at the workplace.
The temporary agency workers can also bring a claim for damages against the relevant client, so the
temporary agency workers may, at their discretion, make a claim against the staffing solutions provider, the
client or both.

**_Other Regulatory Frameworks_**

Whereas most of our business is conducted in the regulatory framework outlined above, we are subject to
certain additional regulation based on the specific nature of the services we provide in each jurisdiction.
Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and regulations that apply to these services.

_Payrolling_

In the case of payrolling, the agency takes on the administrative and financial obligations for, but is not
involved in the recruitment of, consultants. Furthermore, the consultants are (in principle) exclusively
provided to one client. Although payrolling is formally considered a form of temporary agency work, there
is a legal distinction between ‘regular’ temporary agency agreements and payrolling agreements. Under the
new legislation that entered into force on January 1, 2020, the rules regarding payrolling have been
significantly amended. The ABU CLA does not apply to payrolling agreements anymore as of 1 January
2020 (with the exception of limited transitional arrangements).

Payroll employees are entitled to all terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions
(including certain pension entitlements as from January 1, 2021).

The same rules relating to fixed term employment agreements and termination of employment agreements
apply for payroll employees as for regular employees of the client. A temporary employment clause and
the additional flexibility to enter into fixed term employment agreements as set out above are no longer
applicable to payroll employees as of 1 January 2020.

170


-----

Specifically for payrolling, the Dismissal Regulation (Ontslagregeling) contains stricter rules for showing a
reasonable ground for termination. For a payroll employer, the fact that the posting of an employee at the
third party ends will not be a reasonable ground to terminate the employment agreement with such
employee. Instead, the situation at the third party will be taken into account to determine whether a
reasonable termination ground exists.

_Outsourcing of self-employed workers_

If the parties (incorrectly) qualify their relationship as an independent relationship rather than an
employment relationship, this can result in specific liabilities for the party that is considered to be the
employer in the event of a re-characterization of the self-employed relationship into an employment
relationship. Such a determination is made based on all factual circumstances, including the following
three main criteria for establishing an employment relationship: one party undertakes to (i) perform work
(ii) in the service of the other party (iii) for remuneration. Search and selection services

_Search and selection services_

Often, in addition to staffing services, staffing solutions providers also provide staff recruitment services to
their commercial clients. The staffing solutions provider can use its pool of job candidates for their
recruitment and also arrange for initial placements. Rendering recruitment services does not require an
additional permit.

**Germany**

In Germany, temporary staffing is regulated by the Act on Staffing (Arbeitnehmer¨uberlassungsgesetz)
(‘‘AUG[¨] ’’), which has been substantially amended over the years, most recently in 2017. The focus of the
2017 amendment was to strengthen permanent employment; as a result, a maximum period for temporary
staffing has been introduced and formal requirements have been tightened up as has the equal pay
principle.

**_Primary Regulatory Framework_**

Jurisdiction under AUG is established where there is a connection to German territory; it thus regulates[¨]
both domestic staffing as well as cross-border staffing, for example where job candidates are being assigned
to Germany by foreign staffing solutions providers to perform services on German territory.

_Permits or other authorizations_

In Germany, temporary staffing is generally impermissible without a valid permit from the relevant
authorities. If the staffing solutions provider does not have the permit required, an employment
relationship between the client and the job candidate will be assumed pursuant to the AUG, commencing[¨]
at the time at which the work is to commence as set forth in the agreement between the client and the
staffing solutions provider, unless the job candidate objects and declares to the Federal Employment
Agency a preference to stay with the staffing solutions provider. To protect the client, German law requires
the staffing solutions provider to confirm in the agreement with the client that it has obtained the
necessary permit. Procedurally, permits are typically granted for one-year terms, with the option to convert
into an unlimited term permit following the grant of three consecutive one-year permits. This permit is
specific to the staffing solutions provider. Permits may be denied, or revoked if already granted, for
statutory reasons such as the unreliability of the staffing solutions provider, non-compliance with safety
and health regulations, or non-compliance with the AUG.[¨]

_Contractual framework_

The general contractual framework is that a staffing solutions provider concludes an employment
agreement with a job candidate and then places this job candidate with a client. No employment
agreement is concluded between the job candidate and the client, but the client is granted the right to
instruct and direct the job candidate based on an agreement between the staffing solutions provider and
the client (‘‘German Service Agreement’’). Additionally, recent changes in the AUG have imposed specific[¨]
mandatory provisions in German Service Agreements, including, as mentioned, a representation that the
aforementioned permit has been granted, a description of the parameters of the services provided, a
description of occupational qualifications, and details regarding working conditions, such as wages and
benefits. The job candidates assigned under the engagement can either be named in the German Service

171


-----

Agreement itself or separately at a later stage with explicit reference to the German Service Contract. The
German Service Agreement must explicitly be titled a ‘‘staffing agreement’’
(Arbeitnehmer¨uberlassungsvertrag).

Since the job candidate remains the staffing solutions provider’s permanent employee, the provider retains
certain obligations from the employment relationship, such as paying the social security contributions.
Moreover, the provider must inform its job candidates before each assignment that they will be placed as a
temporary worker and provide a written copy of the essential contents of the assignment. Finally, the
staffing solutions provider must involve its works council (if there is one) when the job candidate is hired
and dismissed. All such job candidates, being full members of the staffing solutions provider’s staff, can
vote in and run for works council elections.

_Employment terms and compensation_

In order to emphasize the ‘‘temporary’’ nature of temporary staffing, the AUG amendments provide that[¨]
the same job candidate cannot be assigned to the same client for more than 18 consecutive months. A
period of at least three months and one day where the job candidate is not employed at a given client can
reset this maximum 18 month period. Exceptions to this maximum period are only possible by way of
collective bargaining agreements of the client’s industrial sector or works council agreements on the basis
of such collective bargaining agreements.

Though the employment of the job candidate is temporary for the client, all such job candidates must
typically remain permanent employees of the staffing solutions provider under the German Act on
Part-Time and Temporary Employment (Teilzeit- _und Befristungsgesetz), which applies to all temporary_
employees in Germany. During the assignment, German law requires the main working conditions of the
job candidate, including the compensation, to be the same as those of a comparable permanent employee.
Compensation comprises everything the job candidate would have been entitled to, had such worker been
hired directly by the client (equal pay), and includes, among other things, holiday pay, sick pay, allowances
and benefits and must be paid by the staffing solutions provider as the employer. Therefore, the staffing
solutions provider has the administrative burden to amend the job candidate’s compensation with every
placement in line with on-site conditions. Derogations from the main working conditions are possible on
the basis of a collective bargaining agreement. However, with regard to equal pay, the possibility of any
derogation is limited, because all job candidates must receive compensation equal to that of the client’s
comparable permanent workers after nine months. A longer derogation period can only be agreed by
collective bargaining agreements granting a gradual increase of the candidate’s to the level of the
permanent employees’ compensation within 15 months, beginning in the seventh week of the temporary
employment. Derogations from equal pay are also never applicable with regard to job candidates who have
been employed by the client (or its group) during the last six months preceding the placement.

_Termination_

If the staffing solutions provider wishes to terminate a job candidate’s employment agreement after six
months of employment with the staffing solutions provider, it must establish that (i) it has reasonable
grounds for termination; (ii) the job candidate cannot be redeployed to another suitable position with the
staffing solutions provider or with a client within a reasonable period of time; and if the termination is due
to economic reasons, (iii) that termination of employment was the last option. Since the German legislator
wants to ease the transition from temporary to permanent work, it is forbidden for the staffing solutions
provider to agree on a commission fee with the job candidate if the job candidate concludes an
employment contract with the client he has been placed with after his placement.

_Liability for damages_

Liability for damages can be provided for in the German Service Agreement between the staffing solutions
provider and the client, so they may agree on a disclaimer of liability in favor of the staffing solutions
provider as well as in favor of the client or they may limit the amount of liabilities to the extent covered by
insurance. The job candidate is liable for breaches of duties towards the client and the staffing solutions
provider on a sliding scale, being fully liable only when he has violated his duties intentionally.

_Fines, penalties or other enforcements_

Neglecting or violating any of the abovementioned legal requirements can lead to different severe legal
penalties, based on the nature and seriousness of the breach. If the staffing solutions provider has no

172


-----

permit, the German Service Agreement is not compliant with the formal requirements, or the maximum
staffing period is exceeded, the employment agreement is deemed void and the job candidate is considered
to be an employee of the client, unless the job candidate objects and declares to the Federal Employment
Agency a preference to stay with the staffing solutions provider. In addition, not complying with the permit
regulations may lead to a fine of up to A30,000 for each individual case. The same fine may be imposed
when the maximum staffing period has been exceeded. Higher penalties (up to A500,000) may be imposed
by the German authorities if the equal pay rules have been violated or if the client has used the job
candidate as a replacement for an employee on strike.

Penalties may result from misclassifications of job candidates as self-employed, for example when placing
job candidates with a client as free contractors, consultants, secondees or other similar arrangements, when
they are de facto employees placed under a staffing arrangement. False self-employment may have severe
consequences both in employment and social security law (for example, obligations to retroactively pay
social security contributions for the employer and employee), tax law (liability for income tax). If the
staffing solutions provider is found to have intentionally violated the law, it may also face criminal law
penalties.

There have not yet been many interpretive decisions of the Federal Labor Court of the 2017 amendment of
the AUG and many details are still in dispute.[¨]

_Health and safety obligations_

Job candidates officially assigned to and working for the client are fully integrated into the client’s
organization; as a result, the client must comply with labor and workplace regulations, including any health
and safety regulations with respect to those assigned job candidates. Both the staffing solutions provider
and the client are responsible for the overall well-being of the job candidate including the job candidate’s
physical and mental health, (such as by supervising working times and rest periods, protecting against
unfair treatment and sexual harassment), personal data and (if applicable) his private working material.
The client is required to inform job candidates prior to their assignment of any specific qualifications and
professional skills they need to possess. It is the client’s obligation to inform the job candidate about
dangers the job candidate may face at assignment as well as explain safety measures.

**_Other Regulatory Frameworks_**

Whereas most of our business is conducted in the regulatory framework outlined above, we are subject to
certain additional regulation based on the specific nature of the services we provide in each jurisdiction.
Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and regulations that apply to these specialized
services.

_Search and Selection Services_

Often, in addition to staffing services, staffing solutions providers also provide staff recruitment services to
their commercial clients. The staffing solutions provider can use its pool of job candidates for their
recruitment and also arrange for initial placements. Rendering recruitment services does not require an
additional permit, but the staffing solutions provider requires a prior trade registration
(Gewerbeanmeldung) for such services.

**France**

The description below sets out the current statutory framework governing our operations in France.

**_Primary Regulatory Framework_**

In France, the loan of a job candidate (worker) to a client is strictly regulated under the French Labor
Code. Except in certain limited circumstances such as temporary staffing (portage salarial) or temporary
work agencies, loaning workers to a client may only be provided on a not-for-profit basis; any costs
invoiced by the staffing solutions provider to the client beyond the employee’s salary, social security
charges and professional expenses is prohibited. Additionally, such arrangements require an amendment in
the employment contract between the staffing solutions provider and employee, an inter-company
agreement between the client and the staffing solutions provider, and the consultation and consent of the
relevant works councils.

173


-----

_Permits or other authorizations_

Staffing solutions providers using the contractual framework described below do not require any permit or
authorization for their business in France, other than standard registrations applicable to every company
operating in France with its own employees.

_Contractual framework_

Staffing solutions providers may offer consultants or job candidates to a client on a temporary and
for-profit basis under the framework of a services agreement (contrat de prestation de services), given
certain conditions. A qualifying services agreement encompasses temporary services provided to a client
specific to a certain project, involving specialized skills, techniques, or know-how. Additionally, for workers
to be provided on a for-profit basis under a services agreement, their labor must be closely related to the
main purpose or project of the services agreement and be included within the broader services being
provided by the staffing solutions provider to the client.

Key factors as to whether a for-profit staffing under a services agreement complies with the regulatory
requirements are the following:

- Specific know-how of the service provider: the services must require specialized skills or know-how
not existing within the client.

- Ultimate authority over job candidates: even if the services must be performed in coordination with
the management of the client, the service provider must retain ultimate authority over the job
candidates made available.

- Equipment to carry out the work: the services provider must have and use its own equipment to carry
out the work, and the client must not lend the equipment necessary to provide the agreed services.

_Employment terms and compensation_

Compensation: must be calculated on a flat-fee basis and may not be calculated on an hourly rate basis, as
this would suggest that the provision of services is limited to the provision of labor.

_Termination_

Termination of employment agreements is governed by standard rules and regulations applicable to every
company operating in France with its own employees. If the staffing solutions provider has entered into an
indefinite-term employment agreement with the job candidate, the employment contract can be
terminated by the staffing solutions provider for real and serious cause at any time provided that the
applicable notice period is complied with. The staffing solutions provider and the job candidate can also
enter into a mutual termination agreement, which would then be ratified by the labor authorities. Finally,
the job candidate may also resign from their position provided that the applicable notice period is
complied with.

If the staffing solutions provider has entered into a fixed-term employment contract with the job candidate,
the employment contract can only be prematurely terminated (1) if the parties so agree, (2) in case of gross
misconduct, (3) in case of force majeure, (4) if the employee is declared unfit to work by the occupational
doctor, or (5) if the employee has found an indefinite-term employment. In any other cases, the
employment contract runs its course until its initially-set termination date.

_Liability for damages_

Under French law, the client is liable for all damages done to a third party (including a job candidate), on
the worksite or during work. However, staffing solutions providers remain liable for costs related to
injuries caused by occupational accidents suffered by its in-house employees in the course of their work.

_Fines, penalties or other enforcements_

If the abovementioned contractual framework is not complied with, the services agreement could be
qualified as an illicit loan of workers. Penalties for such a violation can carry a maximum fine of A75,000 or
a maximum prison sentence of five years for the legal representatives of the service provider. Additionally,
a staffing solutions provider may also be liable for a maximum fine of A375,000 and other potential
penalties.

174


-----

_Health and safety obligations_

Job candidates officially assigned to and working for the client are fully integrated into the client’s
organization. As a result, the client must comply with labor and workplace regulations with respect to
assigned job candidates, such as health and safety regulations. In this respect, if individual protection
equipment must be worn by the job candidates, such equipment must be provided by the client.
Obligations relating to occupational medical surveillance are, on the other hand, the responsibility of the
staffing solutions providers.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

From time to time, we may enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates and in the
ordinary course of our business with certain of our shareholders, senior management as well as entities in
which our shareholders or senior management hold ownership interests. These transactions may include,
among others, financing arrangements, lease agreements, shareholder arrangements and commercial
arrangements. We have also in the past entered into transactions with entities that may be deemed to be
affiliates because the Group holds a minority stake in such entities. In addition, entities within our Group
enter into financing and cash pooling agreements.

We believe these agreements are on terms no more favorable to the related parties or our affiliates than
what they would expect to negotiate with disinterested third-parties.

**Other**

_Our transactions with our affiliates will be subject to the affiliate transactions covenant under the Indenture. See_
‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our

**Secured Notes’’) pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Additional Notes are treated as a**
single class together with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Terms capitalized
and otherwise not defined in this section have the meanings given to them in the Senior Secured Notes

The Senior Secured Notes will mature on July 15, 2026. We pay interest on the Senior Secured Notes
semi-annually in arrear on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2020, at a rate

indebtedness on a pari passu basis in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Senior Secured Notes are subject to the Intercreditor Agreement that governs the relative rights of certain
of our creditors as described in ‘‘—The Intercreditor Agreement’’ below.

House of Finance may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after July 15,
2022 at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount of such Senior

Additionally, at any time prior to July 15, 2022, House of Finance is entitled, at its option, to redeem up to
35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, upon not less than 10 or
more than 60 days’ notice, with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of
104.375%, provided that at least 55% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured

of Finance may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of
certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change
of control or upon certain asset sales, each holder of Senior Secured Notes may require House of Finance
to repurchase all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes, at specified redemption prices.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Indenture_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture limits our ability and the ability of certain Restricted Subsidiaries to:
(i) incur or guarantee additional Indebtedness or issue preferred shares, subject to incurrence-based tests
(described below) and permitted debt baskets; (ii) make certain investments or other restricted payments;
(iii) create liens; (iv) sell assets and certain subsidiary stock; (v) pay dividends or make other distributions
or repurchases or redeem capital stock or subordinated debt; (vi) engage in certain transactions with
affiliates; (vii) enter into agreements that restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries or the
repayment of intercompany loans and advances; (viii) engage in mergers or consolidations; and (ix) impair
the security interests in the Collateral. In order to incur additional Indebtedness (other than specified
Permitted Debt) under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined
therein) must be at least 2.0 to 1.0; and, in the case of additional Indebtedness that is Senior Secured
Indebtedness (as defined therein), the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined
therein) must be no greater than 3.81 to 1.0; and, in the case of additional Indebtedness that is Junior
Secured Indebtedness (as defined therein), the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined therein) must
be no greater than 4.75 to 1.0, in each case on a pro forma basis.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture allows us to incur Permitted Debt under Credit Facilities in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the sum of (a) A550 million _plus_
(b) the greater of (i) A100.0 million and (ii) 45.0% of Consolidated EBITDA _plus (c) the greater of_
(i) A110.0 million and (ii) 50.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (d) in the case of any refinancing of any
Permitted Debt under Credit Facilities, the aggregate amount of fees, accrued and unpaid interest,
underwriting discounts, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such refinancing. These covenants (including these incurrence-based tests) are subject to a
number of important exceptions and qualifications.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides for certain events of default, including, among others,
defaults under debt instruments that (i) are caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such
Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness or
(ii) result in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity, and, in each case, the principal
amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness
under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates
A30.0 million or more.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes are governed by the laws of the State
of New York.

The Initial Intercreditor Agreement will be amended on the Issue Date pursuant to an amendment deed
(the ‘‘Amendment Deed’’) (the Initial Intercreditor Agreement as amended by the Amendment Deed, the
‘‘Intercreditor Agreement’’) to contemplate and provide for Second Lien Debt which may not be secured by
Transaction Security (including the Notes), and be consequently subject to the provisions of the Initial
Intercreditor Agreement applicable to Second Lien Debt, mutatis mutandis, except for any provisions
relating to Transaction Security Matters (the ‘‘Unsecured Second Lien Debt’’). On the Issue Date, the
Trustee will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on behalf of the holders of the Notes in accordance
with the terms thereof.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain debt (including debt incurred under the Senior Facilities, the Senior
Secured Notes and the Notes) of the debtors;

- the relative ranking of Transaction Security (defined below) granted by certain members of the
Group;

insolvency events;

- the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of security and other amounts received by the
common security agent appointed under the Intercreditor Agreement on behalf of the senior secured
creditors (the ‘‘Security Agent’’); and

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions related to future indebtedness permitted by the
Indenture that may be incurred by (a) the Parent or a holding company of the Parent (in relation to
indebtedness under paragraph (iv) below), (b) the Issuer and its restricted Subsidiaries which are

indebtedness will (i) have equivalent rights to (A) the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, (B) the holders
of the Senior Facilities liabilities and (C) hedge counterparties holding certain hedging liabilities (which

(such hedge counterparties being ‘‘Hedge Counterparties’’), under the Intercreditor Agreement and may
vote in the same class of creditors as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes liabilities, the holders of the
Senior Facilities and the Hedge Counterparties in respect of enforcement (such indebtedness, including
indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes, indebtedness under the Senior Facilities and indebtedness
owed to the Hedge Counterparties, being the ‘‘Senior Secured Debt’’), (ii) have rights equivalent to the
holders of the Notes that will be limited as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness

Second Lien Debt can be suspended (including through the issuance of a stop notice (and cure provisions
in respect thereof)), (B) restrictions on when the holders of Second Lien Debt can take enforcement action
(including standstill provisions in respect of Second Lien Debt) and (C) the ability of the holders of Second
Lien Debt to purchase Senior Secured Debt in certain circumstances; it being specified that as a
consequence of the Amendment Deed, Second Lien Debt may be incurred under the form of unsecured
financial indebtedness pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and that, as a consequence,
the provisions of the Initial Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Second Lien Debt will be applicable
to the Unsecured Second Lien Debt (including the Notes), _mutatis mutandis, under the Intercreditor_
Agreement, except that no provision applicable to the Second Lien Debt relating to Transaction Security
Matters will be applicable the Unsecured Second Lien Debt or (iii) have rights in respect of such
indebtedness incurred by members of the Group as guarantee obligations that will be limited as set out in
the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness being the ‘‘Senior Subordinated Debt’’) including in
respect of (A) when payments by members of the Group in respect of such indebtedness are permitted to
be made, including the circumstances when payments in respect of Senior Subordinated Debt can be
suspended (including through the issuance of a stop notice (and cure provisions in respect thereof)),
(B) restrictions on when the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt can take enforcement action (including
standstill provisions in respect of Senior Subordinated Debt); _provided that the Intercreditor Agreement_
does not purport to restrict holders of Senior Subordinated Debt to take enforcement action against the
issuer or borrower of the Senior Subordinated Debt or any person which is not a member of the Group
and (C) the ability of the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt to purchase Senior Secured Debt and
Second Lien Debt in certain circumstances.

As set forth in ‘‘—Ranking and priority’’ below, any Second Lien Debt will be subordinated to any Senior
_Secured Debt and any Senior Subordinated Debt guarantees granted by members of the Group will be_
_subordinated to the Senior Secured Debt and the Second Lien Debt on the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._
_Any Second Lien Debt must be bullet and its maturity date must be at least six months after the latest maturity_
_date of any Senior Secured Debt (excluding under any hedging agreement) and the issuer or borrower of Second_
_Lien Debt must be the Issuer or any holding company of the Issuer which is a member of the Group. Any Senior_
_Subordinated Debt must be bullet and its maturity date must be at least six months after the latest maturity date_
_of any Second Lien Debt, or if no such Second Lien Debt is in existence at that time, any Senior Secured Debt_
_(excluding under any hedging agreement) and the issuer or borrower of any Senior Subordinated Debt must be_
_the Parent or any holding company of the Parent._

188


-----

By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms
and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document
because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

_Ranking and priority_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that (1) the liabilities owing to the holders of Senior Secured Debt
rank pari passu in right and priority of payment between themselves and in priority to (A) the holders of
Second Lien Debt, (B) the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt (including all liabilities under any loan
that would made by any entity which is not a member of the Group for the purposes of on-lending the
proceeds of any Senior Subordinated Debt (the ‘‘Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan’’)) and (C) all intraGroup liabilities required to be subordinated as per the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the ‘‘Intra**Group Liabilities’’) and liabilities owed by the Issuer to any subordinated creditor of the Issuer, (2) the**
liabilities owing to the holders of Second Lien Debt rank _pari passu in right and priority of payment_
between themselves and in priority to the Senior Subordinated Debt (including all liabilities under any
Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan) and all Intra-Group Liabilities and liabilities owed by the Issuer to
any subordinated creditor of the Issuer and (3) the liabilities owing to the holders of Senior Subordinated
Debt (including all liabilities under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan) rank pari passu in right and
priority of payment between themselves and in priority to all Intra-Group Liabilities and liabilities owed by
the Issuer to any subordinated creditor of the Issuer’s.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owing to the holders of Senior
Subordinated Debt rank in priority to all liabilities owed by the Parent to any Parent’s subordinated
creditor.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the Intra-Group Liabilities or the liabilities owed by
the Issuer to any Issuer’s subordinated creditor as between themselves.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the liabilities owed by the Parent to any Issuer’s
subordinated creditor as between themselves.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not rank or restrict the payment by any Senior Subordinated Debt
issuer or borrower of any liabilities arising under or in connection with any agreement or instrument in
respect of Senior Secured Debt.

_Guarantees and security_

The lenders under the Senior Facilities, the hedge counterparties, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
and other holders of Senior Secured Debt, any holders of the Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior
Subordinated Debt may subject to certain limits benefit from a common guarantee and security package
(the ‘‘Transaction Security’’). The liabilities owing to the Senior Facilities lenders, the hedge
counterparties, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the other holders of Senior Secured Debt, the
holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt (together and other than the
holders of Unsecured Second Lien Debt, the ‘‘Secured Parties’’) may, to the extent permitted under
applicable law and subject to certain limits be guaranteed by the same debtors and (other than in respect of
the Unsecured Second Lien Debt) will be secured by the same Transaction Security. To the extent
permitted by the Indenture, the Secured Parties are entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to receive
the benefit of such Transaction Security on the basis set forth in ‘‘—Ranking and priority’’ above (the
_obligations secured by Transaction Security being referred to as the_ ‘‘Secured Obligations’’).

The Security Agent Claim (as defined in clause 17.3 (Parallel Debt (Covenant to pay the Security Agent)) of
the Intercreditor Agreement) shall not extend to amounts due under the Unsecured Second Lien Debt
finance documents.

_Priority of security_

The Transaction Security shall rank and secure the liabilities in respect of Senior Secured Debt, Second
Lien Debt and/or Senior Subordinated Debt (but only to the extent such Transaction Security is expressed
to secure those liabilities and irrespective of the date on which such Transaction Security was created
and/or perfected) in the following order: firstly the liabilities in respect of Senior Secured Debt pari passu

189


-----

and without any preference between them; secondly the liabilities in respect of the Second Lien Debt pari
_passu and without any preference between them; and thirdly the liabilities in respect of the Senior_
Subordinated Debt _pari passu and without any preference between them, with the proceeds of the_
Transaction Security to be applied as described under ‘‘—Application of recoveries’’ below.

_Restrictions on payments_

Prior to the final discharge date of all Senior Secured Debt, there shall be no restrictions under the
Intercreditor Agreement on payments to be made to holders of Senior Secured Debt, save that the
Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions regulating payments in respect of hedging liabilities due to
Hedge Counterparties following the occurrence of an acceleration event in respect of the liabilities.

discharge of the Senior Secured Debt to the Issuer, the Security Agent and the agent and/or trustee of any
Second Lien Debt); (ii) the payment is of any of the Second Lien Debt liabilities in accordance with any

Each of the holders of Second Lien Debt, Senior Subordinated Debt and the subordinated creditors shall

requests in order to give effect to the above actions and (b) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any
of the above actions or requests that such creditor takes that action, undertake that action itself in
accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent to enable it to take such
actions.

transferee shall not be treated as a senior creditor or a secured party for the purposes of the

offer made by the relevant holders of Senior Secured Debt);

(a) breach by a holder of Second Lien Debt or a holder of Senior Subordinated Debt of any obligation
under the Intercreditor Agreement resulting in the enforcement of any pledge over a financial

199


-----

instrument account granted in favor of the holders of Senior Secured Debt, the holders Second Lien
Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt becoming impossible;

(b) breach by a holder of Second Lien Debt or a holder of Senior Subordinated Debt of any obligation
towards the holders of Senior Secured Debt under the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(c) enforcement of Transaction Security must be carried out in respect of shares of such entities and/or in
respect of such businesses of members of the Group if in the reasonable opinion of the Security Agent
(acting on behalf of all the secured parties) (as confirmed by an opinion from an independent
internationally recognized investment bank appointed by the Security Agent acting on behalf of the
secured parties (including the holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated
Debt) which should consider the enforcement methods to be used), enforcement of the Lower Senior
Securities is reasonably expected to realize more value within a comparable timeframe for the secured
parties as a whole than enforcement of security granted in favor of the holders Senior Secured Debt,
the holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt (taking into account
the expected enforcement costs, the timing of enforcement and sale and the recovery rights of the
secured parties (including the holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated
Debt)).

_Additional and refinancing indebtedness_

In the event that any debtor incurs any additional indebtedness, or refinances existing indebtedness, that is
permitted to be designated as Senior Secured Debt, Second Lien Debt or Senior Subordinated Debt under
the terms of Senior Secured Debt finance documents, Second Lien Debt finance documents or Senior
Subordinated Debt finance documents and entitled to be secured by the Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities, the liabilities in respect of such additional ore refinancing
liabilities, as the case may be, will share in the proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral securing the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities on a pro rata or lower ranking basis (as applicable) with the
applicable group of creditors, provided that such creditor accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement (if not
already a party thereto), and provided further that the Security Agent other relevant creditors’
representatives shall be empowered to enter into promptly any new Transaction Security document or
promptly amend or waive any terms of an existing Transaction Security document and/or promptly release
any asset from Transaction Security for this purpose, _provided that (i) in relation to the grant of new_
Transaction Security (over assets, rights or interests, or classes or types of assets, rights or interests not
already the subject of an existing Transaction Security document) only, the obligations set out in this
paragraph shall only extend to such Transaction Security that the Security Agent and relevant creditors’
representative are permitted to take and hold under applicable law and/or the policies and rules of the
Security Agent and relevant creditors’ representative in effect at the time, and (ii) in relation to the release
of existing Transaction Security, additional or lower ranking Transaction Security shall be sought instead of
release being given in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Option to purchase_

Following an acceleration event in respect of the Senior Secured Debt or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security, any holder of Second Lien Debt shall have an option (subject to the conditions set
out in the Intercreditor Agreement) to purchase all (and not only part) of Senior Secured Debt at par.

Following an acceleration event in respect of the Senior Secured Debt or in respect of the Second Lien
Debt or the enforcement of any Transaction Security, the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt holding
more than 50% of Senior Subordinated Debt credit participations shall have an option (subject to the
conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) to purchase all (and not only part) of Senior Secured
Debt and the Second Lien Debt at par.

The Issuer will issue A200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7[1]⁄2% Senior Subordinated Notes due
2027 (the ‘‘Initial Notes’’). The Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of December 22,
2020 (the ‘‘Indenture’’), between the Issuer, Guarantors, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee (the
‘‘Trustee’’), Citibank Europe plc, as paying agent (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’), Citibank Europe plc, as transfer
agent (the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’) and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’), in a
private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The
Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and
refers to the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you
to read the Indenture, the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description,
define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the forms of Notes and the
Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption
‘‘Listing and General Information’’.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding relative ranking of indebtedness, the ability to make payments in respect of the
indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination, turnover obligations and
release of guarantees.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the
pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities
Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries’’ for purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under ‘‘—Certain Definitions—’’Unrestricted
_Subsidiary’’, we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’._
Any future Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture
and will not guarantee the Notes.

**The Notes**

The Notes will:

- be unsecured and general senior subordinated obligations of the Issuer;

- be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future Senior Debt of the Issuer, including the
Guarantee Incurred under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, Senior Facilities Agreement and
certain Hedging Obligations;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer
that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation, including the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement;

- be guaranteed by the Guarantors as described under ‘‘—The Note Guarantees’’;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer
that are not Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors;

202


-----

- mature on January 15, 2027; and

- be represented by one or more registered notes in global registered form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’).

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by Pledgeco, House of Finance, Accent Construct NV, Accent Jobs For
People NV, Continu B.V., Covebo Productie en Logistiek BV, Covebo Techniek BV, TimePartner
Personalmanagement GmbH and Talent & Pro Nederland BV (collectively, the ‘‘Initial Guarantors’’),
each of which (other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) will be a guarantor or obligor under Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities. In addition, if required by the covenant described under ‘‘—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees,’’ subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the_
Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the
future (the ‘‘Additional Guarantors’’ and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the ‘‘Guarantors’’). The
Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

- be an unsecured general senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor;

be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future Senior Debt of that Guarantor,
including any Indebtedness Incurred under (or Guarantees of) the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations;

- rank _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Pari Passu Indebtedness of that_
Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that
is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation, including the Senior Secured Notes
and Senior Facilities Agreement; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such
Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or
unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, ‘‘thin
capitalization’’ rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of
corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under
applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to
the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be
subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. The Note Guarantees will be further
limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting of
guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Facilities and the
Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal
limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the
benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these
limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note
Guarantee.

For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020, the Guarantors (each on an unconsolidated basis)
in aggregate represented substantially all of our consolidated EBITDA.

Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors
holding debt and Guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders
(if any) of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors,

203


-----

including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of
significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by
Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock under the Indenture. See ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’.

**Note Guarantees Release**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor (other than Pledgeco and House of Finance) will terminate and
release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of
the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such Guarantor), if the
sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;

(2) upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all the
assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the Indenture;

(3) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in ‘‘—Defeasance’’ and
‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(5) upon the release of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees’’;_

(6) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement relating to the release of a Note Guarantee upon an enforcement sale or other disposal of
such Guarantor;

(7) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’;

(8) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

(9) with respect to an entity that is not the successor Guarantor, as a result of a transaction permitted by
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation’’.

The Note Guarantee of Pledgeco and House of Finance will terminate and be released upon the
occurrence of an event described in clauses (4), (6), (7) and (9) above.

The Trustee shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested in writing by the Issuer, including the
granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without the consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the
Trustee.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue A200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes
will mature on January 15, 2027. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of A100,000 and
integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 7[1]⁄2% per annum and will:

- accrue from (and including) the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from (and including)
the interest payment date it was most recently paid;

- be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15, commencing on July 15, 2021;

204


-----

- be payable to the holder of record of the Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the
related interest payment date;

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months; and

- be calculated on the nominal amount of the Notes.

Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1%
higher than the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Notes.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such
payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the
next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other
payment as a result of any such delay.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’, the Issuer is_
permitted to issue additional Notes of the same or different series, which shall have terms substantially
identical to the Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate supplied to the Trustee (‘‘Additional Notes’’):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or
rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which
such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates
for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which
such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees.

All series of Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes
of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for any applicable series; _provided, that if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the_
Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional Notes will be issued with a
separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, from the
Notes originally issued. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this
‘‘Description of the Notes’’, references to ‘‘Notes’’ shall be deemed to include references to the Notes
initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes. The phrase ‘‘Notes’’ refers also to the
book-entry interest in the Notes as long as the Notes are deposited with the NBB-SSS (as defined below).
For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, Additional Notes may be designated to be of
the same series as the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially
identical in all material respects to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, and shall be deemed to
form one series therewith, and references to the Notes shall be deemed to include the Notes initially issued
on the Issue Date as well as any such Additional Notes.

205


-----

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

As long as the Notes are deposited with the NBB-SSS (as defined below), principal, interest, premium and
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be made to the Paying Agent for
payment to the NBB-SSS to credit to Euroclear, Clearstream or any other direct Participant in the
NBB-SSS (as applicable) which will in turn, distribute such payments in accordance with their relevant
procedures.

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (‘‘Definitive
**Registered Notes’’) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents. In**
addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by bank
transfer to the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive
Registered Notes. See ‘‘—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes’’ below.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes (including the initial Paying Agent). The
initial Paying Agent will be Citibank Europe plc (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’).The Issuer will also maintain a
registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) and a transfer agent (the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’). The initial Registrar will be
Citibank, N.A., London Branch and the initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank Europe plc. The Registrar
will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and
together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of
the Notes shall also be maintained at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between
the register of the Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the
register kept by the Registrar shall prevail.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders of the Notes. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange
and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying
Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or
Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

- each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’). The 144A Global Notes
will, on the Issue Date, be deposited by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Issuer with the NBB as
operator of the NBB-SSS pursuant to an agreement between the Issuer, the Paying Agent and the
NBB; and

- each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘Global
**_Notes’’). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited by the Paying Agent on_**
behalf of the Issuer with the NBB as operator of the NBB-SSS pursuant to an agreement between the
Issuer, the Paying Agent and the NBB.

All interests in the Notes are subject to the procedures and requirements of the NBB-SSS. Ownership of
interests in the Global Notes (‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that will hold such Notes
in an exempt securities account (an ‘‘X Account’’) with the NBB-SSS (either directly or indirectly through a
Participant in the NBB-SSS (including Euroclear Bank and Clearstream) (and for a full list of Participants
as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, see https://www.nbb.be/doc/
ti/20191106_nbbsss_participants.pdf). Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers
thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and
described more fully under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between
Participants will be effected by such Participants pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by the NBB-SSS and its respective Participants. Book-Entry
Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the ‘‘144A Book-Entry Interests’’) may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S

206


-----

**Book-Entry Interests’’) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written**
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and in accordance with any applicable securities
law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will
become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after
such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of A100,000
and integral multiples of A1,000, in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Transfer Agent and the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Participants, as
applicable, from the Participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise
determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with
respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Notice to
_Investors’’._

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of A100,000 and integral
multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will
require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements
and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at the NBB-SSS
(including that such transferee will hold the Notes in an X Account), where appropriate, to furnish certain
certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such
transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in
connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat
the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound; Subordination**
**of the Note Guarantees on the basis of the Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors under certain financing
arrangements, including the Notes, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities, the Trustee will
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
obligations of the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be subordinated to the obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities, including any Guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes and Senior
Facilities, and will be subject to, among other things, certain standstills on enforcement and turnover
obligations. Each of the Note Guarantees is a senior subordinated obligation of the relevant Guarantor,
which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each such Note Guarantee ranks

207


-----

behind, and is expressly subordinated to, obligations owed by the relevant Guarantor under its guarantee
of the Senior Secured Notes (or in respect of House of Finance, its obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes), the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and any other indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred on a senior basis to the Notes. Upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, the
Note Guarantees of the Guarantors may be released and discharged without the consent of holders of the
Notes in connection with a distressed disposals and foreclosures under the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and that
the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the Holders of the Notes) to
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to
have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’._

**Optional Redemption**

On and after January 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (except as permitted under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’ below), at
the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on January 15 of the years indicated
below:

**Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under ‘‘—Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’ the Notes
are not redeemable until January 15, 2023.

Prior to January 15, 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem in the aggregate up to 35%
of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional
Notes of the same series), upon not less than 10 or more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate
amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price
(expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 107.500% as of the date of the applicable redemption
notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 55% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of
any Additional Notes of the same series) issued under the Indenture remain outstanding after each
such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Prior to January 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a portion of the Notes upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (except as permitted under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’ below), at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium and

208


-----

accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, all of the Notes, if holders of not less
than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender
offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such
holders, then all holders will have been deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and the
Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice following
such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal
to the price paid to each other holder in such tender offer (excluding any early tender or incentive fee),
plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice
of redemption will be provided as set forth under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as Notes are listed on any
securities exchange and the rules of such an exchange so require, inform the exchange of such optional
redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of Notes that will remain outstanding
immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is
registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any
such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. In
addition, the Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption that payment of the redemption price and the
performance of its obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person;
_provided,_ _however, that the Issuer will remain obligated to pay the redemption price and perform its_
obligations with respect to such redemption in the event such other Person fails to do so. Notice of any
redemption in respect of an Equity Offering may be given prior to completion thereof.

If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a satisfaction and
discharge or defeasance of the Indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under ‘‘—Defeasance’’
or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’, requests that the Trustee distribute to the Holders amounts deposited in
trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued and unpaid interest to the
date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the applicable redemption notice will
state that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (i) on or promptly after the
date fixed for redemption or (ii) on such earlier payment date as selected by the Issuer.

**_Mandatory Redemption_**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis or (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form, based
on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Paying Agent or Registrar deems
fair and appropriate and in accordance with rules of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear and Clearstream (as
applicable), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements.
None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in
accordance with this paragraph. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the

209


-----

Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in accordance with the prevailing rules
of the Exchange and in addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the
redemption date (except as permitted below), mail such notice to Holders of the Notes by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar
with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. In the case of Global Notes, such notice of redemption
may also be sent in accordance with the rules and procedures of the NBB-SSS for communication thereof
to Euroclear, Clearstream or any relevant Participant (as applicable), rather than mail. On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or the part of the Notes called for redemption.

As long as the Notes are deposited with the NBB-SSS, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant
notices to the NBB-SSS for communication thereof to Euroclear, Clearstream or any relevant direct
Participants, or may be given to such direct Participants directly, for communication by such direct
Participants to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforementioned mailing.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new
Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive
Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made
on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption
become due on the date fixed for redemption. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent, the related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall such date of redemption be delayed to a date later than
60 days after the date on which such notice was sent, except that redemption notices may be mailed more
than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes
or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may
be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior written notice (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed
for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as
defined below under ‘‘—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts’’), if any, then due and which will become
due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer
determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change, or amendment to, the existing official written position or the introduction of an official
written position regarding in the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on
the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement
cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to
pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available
to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this
would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or
after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis
_mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with_
respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture.

210


-----

A notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
(a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the
time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the
publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been
satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable
measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that
the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax
Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry,
in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
‘‘Payor’’) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free
and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding
or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Note Guarantee is made by
or on behalf of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’), will at any time be required by law to be
made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Note or any Note
Guarantee, as applicable, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any,
the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts as may be necessary in order
that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including
any such deduction or withholding from such additional amounts), will equal the amounts which would
have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee, as applicable, in the
absence of such withholding or deduction (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’); _provided, however, that no such_
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership,
limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but for the
avoidance of doubt not limited to, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or
national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or being physically
present in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely
from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise
or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture, a Note Guarantee, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request by the Payor addressed to
the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would
be made), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence, or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or
similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by
a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction of, all or part of such Tax but

211


-----

only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or
documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment
(where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available
for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, use, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax,
assessment or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to such Note or Note Guarantee to any Holder who is a
fiduciary or a partnership (including any entity that is treated as a partnership for applicable tax
purposes) or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the
beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership (or entity treated
as a partnership for applicable tax purposes) or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Note
directly;

(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, (the ‘‘Code’’), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version
of such sections that are substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any
official interpretations thereof, any intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and
the United States with respect to the foregoing and any law, regulation, or official interpretation
thereof implementing such intergovernmental agreement, or any agreements entered into pursuant to
Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code;

(8) to a Holder of Notes, who at the time of acquisition of the Notes, was not an Eligible Investor or to a
Holder of Notes who was an Eligible Investor at the time of acquisition of the Notes but, for reasons
within the Holder’s control, either ceased to be an Eligible Investor or, at any relevant time on or after
the acquisition of the Notes, otherwise failed to meet any other condition for the exemption of
Belgian withholding tax pursuant to the Belgian law of August 6, 1993 relating to certain securities, or
is an Eligible Investor but is not holding the Note in the NBB-SSS (except if not holding the Note in
the NBB-SSS results from the conversion of the Note into Definitive Registered Notes following an
Event of Default in relation to a Payor under the Indenture);

(9) to a Holder of Notes who is liable to such Taxes because the Notes were upon its request converted
into Definitive Registered Notes and could no longer be cleared through the NBB-SSS (except if such
request is made following an Event of Default in relation to a Payor under the Indenture) ; or

(10) any combination of the items (1) through (9) above.

For the avoidance of doubt, Additional Amounts will in any case be payable by the Payor to a Holder of
Notes who is liable to such Taxes because the Notes were converted into Definitive Registered Notes and
could no longer be cleared through the NBB-SSS following an Event of Default in relation to a Payor
under the Indenture.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide
certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies
of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such
copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the
offices of the relevant Paying Agent.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to
any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment,
the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will
be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the
Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation
to pay Additional Amounts arises or the Payor becomes aware less than 45 days prior to the relevant

212


-----

payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable
thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related
interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (and in the case of
enforcement, any jurisdiction) from the execution, delivery, registration, issuance, or enforcement of, or
receipt of payments with respect to, the Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security
Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in
connection with a transfer of the Notes after the initial resales by the Initial Purchasers pursuant to this
Offering and limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect
thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under
clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is organized or incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment with respect to the Notes
(or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading ‘‘Change
_of Control’’, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to_
A100,000 or integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof, if applicable; provided that Notes of A100,000 or
less, as the case may be, may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Notes as described
under this heading, ‘‘Change of Control’’, in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised
its right to redeem all of the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under ‘‘—Optional
_Redemption’’ and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived._

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ and all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a
notice (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) to each Holder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal
to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record
on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the ‘‘Change of Control
**Payment’’);**

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’);

213


-----

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not
paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to
the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control
Offer.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its
election, who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such
tender has been accepted by the Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly
credit the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and
deduct the corresponding amount of such Notes from such Holder’s NBB-SSS, Euroclear or Clearstream
(as applicable) account.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes
upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or
its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control and conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to
this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue
of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited
by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would
require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Senior Facilities.

In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities or the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future
Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would
constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could
cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself

214


-----

does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay
cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases.

The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified
other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’,
there is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control
has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a
majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur_
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence, after giving pro forma
effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Credit Facility (including
in respect of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder) in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the sum of (a) A550 million plus
(b) the greater of (i) A100.0 million and (ii) 45.0% of Consolidated EBITDA plus (c) the greater of
(i) A110.0 million and (ii) 50.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (d) in the case of any refinancing of
any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of
fees, accrued and unpaid interest, underwriting discounts, premiums (including tender premiums) and
other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred by
another provision of this covenant; _provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is_
subordinated to the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to the
Notes or such Note Guarantee to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or
(b) without limiting the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’, Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of
the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however,
that:

(a) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the obligee is a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and ((i) except in
respect of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in connection with the cash pooling and other
cash management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course
of business, (ii) to the extent legally permitted (the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having
completed all procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the
obligee or obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in
connection with the subordination of such Indebtedness) and (iii) if the aggregate principal

215


-----

amount of such Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness that is outstanding for a period of less
than 30 days) of the Issuer or such Guarantor owed to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor exceeds A5.0 million) expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all
obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable Note Guarantee,
in the case of a Guarantor; and

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
and any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such
Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and the related Note
Guarantees and any related ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations created under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) any Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness described
in clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4)(a) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date, after giving pro
_forma effect to the Transactions, including Indebtedness incurred under the Senior Secured Notes_
Indenture and the related Guarantees and any related ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations created under
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents; and

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clauses (4) and
(5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (i) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant
to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that, with_
respect to this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition or other transaction and after giving _pro_
_forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness,_
either (i) the Issuer would have been able to Incur A1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related
Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(6) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under Hedging Obligations not for speculative
purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consisting of:

(a) (i) Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money Obligations or other financings
Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction
or improvement of property, plant or equipment used or useful in a Similar Business or
(ii) Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design,
construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used
or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock
of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds
such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together
with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7)(a) and
then outstanding, will not exceed at any time the greater of A25.0 million and 11.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA; and

(b) Ordinary Course Lease Obligations;

(8) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of (a) workers’ compensation
claims, self-insurance obligations, performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, completion, appeal,
advance payment, customs, value added tax or other tax guarantees or other similar bonds,
instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary

216


-----

course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement, (b) letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or
obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement;
_provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or other similar instruments, the_
obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing, (c) the financing of insurance
premiums in the ordinary course of business; and (d) any customary treasury and/or cash management
services, including treasury, depository, overdraft, credit card processing, credit or debit card,
purchase card, electronic funds transfer, the collection of checks and direct debits, cash pooling and
other cash management arrangement or netting or setting-off arrangements, in each case, in the

any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in
connection with such disposition;

(10) (a) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary arising from the honoring by a bank or

(11) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate outstanding principal amount

or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first
paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ to the extent the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur
Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed

217


-----

shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to the extent the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph or
clause (1), (6) or (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments’’ in reliance thereon;_

(14) Guarantees of Indebtedness of Persons other than the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, _provided_
that the maximum principal amount of Indebtedness guaranteed pursuant to this clause (14) does not
exceed the greater of A45.0 million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA in the aggregate at any one
time outstanding; and

(15) Indebtedness outstanding under local lines of credit or local facilities (including local bilateral
facilities, working capital facilities or overdraft facilities) in an aggregate principal amount at any one
time outstanding not to exceed the greater of A55.0 million and 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA.

_provided, however, that no more than the greater of A75.0 million and 35.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of_
Indebtedness at any time outstanding may be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary which is not a Guarantor
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and clauses (1), (5)(ii) and (11) under the second
paragraph of this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or
the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) notwithstanding clause (1) above, all Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities and any
refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7),
(11), (13) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ in relation to the second paragraph of this
covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured at the option of the Issuer on the most recent
date on which new commitments are obtained or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in
the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term
facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such
date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available; and

(8) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence,
if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if
calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs and
fees in connection with such refinancing; and

218


-----

(9) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification
of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to
be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The amount of any Indebtedness
outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued
with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of
any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency
other than Euro shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred
(whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving
credit facility; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness_
denominated in a currency other than Euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount
set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date;
and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency
Agreement (with respect to the Euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the
amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such
agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor
unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the
applicable Note Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness
will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different
collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall
or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s or any Restricted
Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’);

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other
acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to herein
as a ‘‘Restricted Payment’’), if at the time the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted
Payment:

(a) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur an additional A1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of
the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ after giving effect, on a pro forma basis,
to such Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made subsequent
to the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted
Payments permitted below by clauses (4), (5), (10), (11) or (17) of the third paragraph of this
covenant, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the third paragraph of this
covenant) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from
January 1, 2019 to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such
Restricted Payment for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are
available (or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in
accordance with the next paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by
the Issuer from the issue or sale of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding subsequent to the Senior Secured
Notes Issue Date or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of the Issuer subsequent to the Senior

each case sold to a Subsidiary of the Issuer, (x) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or
marketable securities received from an issuance or sale of such Capital Stock to a Restricted
Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any

Restricted Subsidiary, (y) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities to the
extent that any Restricted Payment has been made from such proceeds in reliance on clause (1)
or (6) of the third paragraph of this covenant, and (z) Excluded Contributions);

any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Senior
Secured Notes Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for
Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or

property or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
upon such conversion or exchange);

(iv) (a) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in
accordance with the next paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the disposition of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or the
disposition or repayment of any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment made after the
Senior Secured Notes Issue Date (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or an
employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer
for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or

with the next paragraph) of any property or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer

assets, excluding the amount of any Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary that constituted a
Permitted Investment made pursuant to clause (11) of the definition of Permitted Investment;
and

(vi) 100% of any dividends or distributions received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after the
Senior Secured Notes Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the_
preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included in any of the foregoing
clause (iv), (v) or (vi); provided further that (A) notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts,
the ‘‘Excluded Amounts’’) that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for
Restricted Payments pursuant to the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts
result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received in
contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control
pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of such Net Cash
Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that would not have
been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities
and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in connection with such Change of Control in accordance with
the requirements of the Indenture; and (B) upon the occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event,

references to the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date in the preceding clause (c) shall thereafter refer to the
date of such Specified Change of Control Event

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be the
fair market value thereof as determined by an Officer of the Issuer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer
in good faith.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, ‘‘Permitted Payments’’):

(1) any Restricted Payment made by exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to the exercise of a
conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional

through an Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer; provided, however, that to the extent so applied, the
Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value of property or assets or of marketable securities, from such
sale of Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from
clause (c)(ii) of the first paragraph of this covenant and will not be considered to be Net Cash
Proceeds from an Equity Offering for the purposes of the ‘‘Optional Redemption’’ provisions of the
Indenture; _provided,_ _further that notwithstanding the foregoing, any Excluded Amounts shall be_
excluded from the calculation of the amount of Permitted Payments pursuant to this clause;

that any Restricted Payment made under this clause (19) may only be made within 15 months
following the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date; and

(20) the Distribution.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value
of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash
Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur,
assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of Restricted

income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the ‘‘Initial Lien’’),
except (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and
the Indenture (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of Guarantors) are directly secured, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles (but without regard to any Agreed Security Principles limiting the types of
assets that may be pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees under the Indenture), equally and

224


-----

ratably with, or senior in priority to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Holders of Notes pursuant to clause (2) of the preceding paragraph
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the
Initial Lien to which it relates.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each
case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities) and
any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, (b) the
Indenture, the Notes, the Senior Secured Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents or any related security documents or (c) any other agreement or
instrument with respect to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in each case, in effect on the Issue
Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person
was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of
assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant
to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into
or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date, which encumbrance or
restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the
Person and its Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Issuer (as defined_
under ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such
Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews,
refinances or replaces any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3) (an ‘‘Initial Agreement’’) or contained in any amendment, supplement or
other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this
clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Issuer);

225


-----

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the

Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to
the Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities
and the Indenture, together with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor
Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or
(B) the Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances
or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or
interest payments on the Notes and the Issuer and Guarantors’ ability to comply with their respective
obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions created in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Liens’’; or_

(14) customary provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture
agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other
similar agreements in the ordinary course of business (including agreements entered into in

226


-----

connection with a Restricted Investment), which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the
subject of such agreements; provided that the Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence of such
encumbrances that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect,
the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes and the Issuer and
Guarantors’ ability to comply with their respective obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not
less than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Issuer); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such
Asset Disposition consists of:

(a) cash (including any net cash proceeds received from the conversion, within 180 days of such Asset
Disposition, of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
recorded on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the
date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary
remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that
is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer and each
other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of
such Asset Disposition;

(d) Replacement Assets;

(e) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second paragraph of
this covenant;

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons
who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness
(i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of A30.0 million and 14.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market
value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (g) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of the
Asset Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset
Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(1) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (i) any Senior Debt, (ii) any Pari Passu Indebtedness or any
refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; _provided that in the case of this clause (ii) only (A) in_
connection with any such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of term Indebtedness, the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such term Indebtedness and will cause the related
commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so
prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed and (B) the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with
this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth

227


-----

below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of the Notes equal to the
proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding bears to (y) the total
aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount
outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than the Notes); or (iii) any Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien (in each
case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at
least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) or by
making an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Notes (in accordance with the procedures set
out below) or redeem the Notes as described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in
a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4),
(5) or (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; _provided that a binding commitment shall be_
treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until
the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following
the expiration of the aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by
that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in the previous paragraph constitutes
‘‘Excess Proceeds’’. Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily
reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not
prohibited by the terms of the Indenture. On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition or such earlier time
if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds A15.0 million, the Issuer will be
required to make within 30 Business Days thereof an offer (an ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders
and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to
purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu
Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any such Pari
Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100%
of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption premium, if any, to, but not including, the
date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations A100,000 and in integral
multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable).

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants
contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders,
collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the
Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of
calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in Euro, such Indebtedness
shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a

228


-----

date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in
respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are
denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash
into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer Period’’). No later than
five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the ‘‘Asset Disposition
**Purchase Date’’), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari**
Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer
**Amount’’) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and**
Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the
Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a _pro rata_
basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or
portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn and in minimum denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof
(if applicable). The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or
portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant.
The Paying Agent shall deliver to the Holders of Notes the purchase price of Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the appropriate amounts of Notes from such Holders’
accounts with NBB-SSS, Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). Any Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the
Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of
this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of
any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series
of related transactions being an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate value in excess of
A10.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of A20.0 million, the terms
of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority
of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction
complies with clause (1) above; and

(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of A60.0 million, a written
opinion of an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of international standing, or other
recognized independent expert of international standing with experience appraising the terms and
conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required,
stating that the transaction or series of related transactions is (i) fair from a financial point of view
taking into account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not materially less favorable than might
have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person
who is not an Affiliate.

the Issuer or relevant Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved thereby;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers, sellers of goods or services, providers of

a material acquisition, acquired company financial information; (iii) the audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income

(vi) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first, second and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year
of the Issuer, unaudited quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (i) the
Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter and year-to-date period
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together
with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited _pro forma income statement and balance sheet_
information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant quarter;
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financial information; (iii) an operating and financial discussion of the unaudited
financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer (including disclosure
of the amount outstanding as of the most recent balance sheet of Ordinary Course Lease
Obligations); (iv) a discussion of material changes in material debt instruments since the most recent
report; and (v) material subsequent events and any material changes to the operational risk factors
disclosed in the most recent annual report; provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and
(v) may be provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director change at the
Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or the listing of such Capital
Stock on a recognized European, United Kingdom or United States stock exchange, the requirements of
clause (1), (2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the
reporting requirements of such stock exchange; _provided that (x) the IPO Entity shall provide financial_
statements consistent with the requirements of clause (2)(i)above for the first three quarterly periods in
each fiscal year after the Issue Date pursuant to clause (2) and (y) to the extent such IPO Entity relies on
such stock exchange reporting requirements to fulfill the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, a
reasonably detailed description of such material differences between the financial statements of such IPO
Entity and the financial statements of the Issuer shall be included for any period after the Issue Date.

So long as Notes are outstanding, after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly reports required
by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will promptly hold a conference call
to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period.

Any person who requests or accesses such financial information or seeks to participate in any conference
calls required by this covenant may be required to provide its email address, employer name and other
information reasonably requested by the Issuer and represent to the Issuer (to the Issuer’s reasonable good
faith satisfaction) that:

(1) it is a holder of the Notes, a beneficial owner of the Notes, a bona fide prospective investor in the
Notes, a bona fide market maker in the Notes affiliated with any Initial Purchaser or a bona fide
securities analyst providing an analysis of investment in the Notes;

(2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations;

(3) it will keep such provided information confidential and will not communicate the information to any
Person; and

(4) it (a) will not use such information in any manner intended to compete with the business of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries and (b) is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (i) is
principally engaged in a Similar Business or (ii) derives a significant portion of its revenues from
operating or owning a Similar Business.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for
so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not ‘‘affiliates’’
under the Securities Act.

232


-----

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports
furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website. All financial statement information shall be prepared in
accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the
basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may
otherwise be described in such information; _provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1),_
(2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to
such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer. In
addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of
the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
‘‘Reports’’ covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act with the SEC, or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the
Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of
U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for
so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor
**Issuer’’) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European**
Union, the United Kingdom, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will
expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer would
be able to Incur at least an additional A1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for
the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available
immediately preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would not be less than it
was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such

233


-----

supplemental indenture (if any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the
Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as
to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties
and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes or the Note Guarantee,
as the case may be.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it

unless:

(a) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) (1) either (x) a Guarantor or the Issuer is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note
Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Guarantor under the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; and
(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the Indenture;

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) under the heading ‘‘—The Guarantors’’_
above shall not apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (a) and (b)(1) could give rise to or result
in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the
laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability
for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership)
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership,
directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

234


-----

The provisions set forth in this ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor
or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; or (ii) any Guarantor (other than Pledgeco)
consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of
changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing
the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clause (3)(b) under the heading ‘‘—The Guarantors
shall apply to any such transaction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
implement a Permitted Reorganization.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ‘‘Suspension Event’’), then, beginning on that day
and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the
‘‘Reversion Date’’), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply
to the Notes:

(1) ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

(2) ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’;

(3) ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

(4) ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’;

(5) ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’;

(6) ‘‘—Limitation on Additional Guarantees’’; and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) under ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer’’

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first
day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect
with regard to actions of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken during the continuance of
the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event
of Default. The ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect
since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion
Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have
been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’. In addition, the Indenture will
also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes
cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into
during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade
Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph
under this caption have been satisfied; _provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the_
suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that
the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any
Credit Facility or any other Public Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted
Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable,
executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture

235


-----

pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee; provided, however, that such
Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as
the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under ‘‘—Note
_Guarantees Release’’. A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the_
Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was
Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if
such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee shall take all necessary actions,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to the Trustee being indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described
under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness
referred to in the foregoing clause (1), the Issuer and the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and
the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms
as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees; _provided that such_
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any
Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including, with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes),
(3) add Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) secure
the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (6) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on
such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer
shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’,
and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in
the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of Subordinated Indebtedness; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ and the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described

236


-----

herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**Listing**

The Issuer will use its reasonable efforts to (i) obtain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange and for permission to be granted to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange as
promptly as practicable after the Issue Date and (ii) maintain such listing and admission to trading for so
long as such Notes are outstanding; _provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain such listing, or if_
maintenance of such listing becomes unduly onerous, it will, prior to the delisting of the Notes from the
Official List of the Exchange, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes
on another ‘‘recognised stock exchange’’ as defined in section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the
United Kingdom.

**Payments for Consent**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder of Notes for or as an inducement to
any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes
unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the Notes that consent, waive
or agree to such amendment in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such
consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent,
waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude Holders of Notes in
any jurisdiction or any category of Holders of Notes where (1) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or
amendment, including in connection with any tender or exchange offer, or (2) the payment of the
consideration therefor could reasonably be interpreted as requiring the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws or
listing requirements (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of
the European Union or any of its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting
in good faith) (a) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially
burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar
documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction)
or (b) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction or with
respect to such category of Holders of Notes.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Acquisition**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection
with any Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of the applicable basket or ratio and of
any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for
such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro
_forma basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be_
entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining
the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes of any
subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or
ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in
Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and
at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will
not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining
whether the Limited Condition Acquisition and the related transactions are permitted hereunder and
(y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition
Acquisition or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations
occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence
of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the
definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or
ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Limited
Condition Acquisition.

237


-----

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase,
upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation’’;_

(4) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after written notice to the
Issuer by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with
its other agreements contained in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary), other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (‘‘payment default’’); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the ‘‘cross acceleration
**provision’’),**

and in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been
so accelerated, aggregates A30.0 million or more;

(6) other than on a solvent basis, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer
or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary
(the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of A30.0 million (exclusive of any
amounts for which a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability), which judgments are not
paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the ‘‘judgment
**default provision’’); and**

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations
under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days (the ‘‘guarantee provision’’).

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes under the Indenture, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the
Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and
unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such
principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a
declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under the
definition of Events of Default has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes
shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default
pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after
the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the
Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all

238


-----

existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may
not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to
the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive any past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except
with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, the waiver of
which shall require the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal
amount of the Notes affected) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences
if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to
the Trustee indemnity or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may
pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to
pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security, indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to the
Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of such security, indemnity and/or prefunding; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available
to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide
that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the
exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own
affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or
that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification, prefunding and/or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses,
liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of
such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days
after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that
occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the
occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain
Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an ‘‘Initial Default’’), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply

239


-----

with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to
deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be
cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable,
even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances,
but only if the Trustee is indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. It may not be possible
for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the
Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for
Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof
may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Notes); _provided that, if any amendment, supplement, other modification or waiver will only_
amend, supplement or waive one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required. However, without the consent of
Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected, an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder or, if any
amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, supplement, modify or waive one series of the
Notes, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate
principal amount of such series of Notes affected, with respect to any such series of Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note
may be redeemed, in each case as described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’;

(5) make any Note payable in a currency other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder of any outstanding Note to bring suit for the enforcement of any
payment of principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s
Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Withholding Taxes/Additional
_Amounts’’ that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or_
amends the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the
Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Issuer agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver
of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note Guarantees or
the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

240


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent
or the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee, the Security
Agent or any of the Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Additional Guarantees’’, to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add_
security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination,
discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien or any amendment in respect thereof with
respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment
is provided for under the Indenture, the relevant security documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any provision of this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to
the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim
recitation of a provision of the Indenture or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or security agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent
to any Notes Document;

(9) as provided in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’;

(10) to provide for or facilitate the issuance of uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated
Notes; _provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for the purposes of_
Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are not treated as
‘‘registration-required obligations’’ under Section 163(f)(2)(A) of the Code;

(11) to comply with the rules of any applicable depositary; or

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of the
Notes or, if Incurred in compliance with the Indenture, Additional Notes; _provided that compliance_
with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the
Securities Act or any applicable securities laws and regulations and such amendment does not
materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of
the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in
connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clause (3) above to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the
supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such Additional Guarantor to be duly authorized
and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such Additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments
permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer and the Trustee.

241


-----

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding; provided that, for the purpose of determining whether the
Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes which the Trustee
knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither the Holders (or any relevant percentage thereof) nor the
Trustee will be entitled to convene a meeting of Holders and the Issuer will not be required to convene
such meeting even if requested to do so by the Holders (or any relevant percentage thereof) or by the
Trustee.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes and
the Indenture (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust (as defined below), the rights, powers,
trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security
payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the
rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ obligations under the covenants
described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (1) and (2) under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Issuer’’) and ‘‘Change of Control’’ and the default provisions relating to such_
covenants described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above, the operation of the cross-default upon a Payment
Default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to any Significant
Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision
described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ (‘‘covenant defeasance’’).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of
the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer
exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1)
and (2) of the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer’’),
(4), (5), (6) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
when taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary), (7) or (8) under ‘‘—Events of Default’’.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the ‘‘defeasance
**trust’’) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this**
purpose) cash in Euro or Euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof
sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, _provided that, if requested by the Issuer, the Trustee will distribute any_
amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may
be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the
relevant Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts
and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the
United States must be based on a ruling received by the Issuer from, or published by, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

242


-----

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and qualifications), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with
either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to
surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the
Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for
payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated
Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption; (2) the Issuer has deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the
Trustee for this purpose), money or Euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof, as applicable in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on
the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other
sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee
under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be (subject to the succeeding sentences), and (5) the Issuer has delivered
to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may not be
an employee of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the
‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’ section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as
to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)). The Trustee
or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer and reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee, acting for the Trustee for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited
pursuant to this paragraph to the Holders on the date specified in writing (in the above referenced notice
of redemption or Officer’s Certificate or otherwise) by the Issuer at least two Business Days prior to the
specified date of distribution, which date of distribution may in the Issuer’s discretion be prior to the
Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution
and payment to Holders prior to the redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative
interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the
Notes are represented by a Global Note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to
the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject
to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the
Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public
policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Citibank, N.A., London Branch is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such
duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same
degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the
Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

243


-----

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of
the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect
of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar, the Security Agent and any other agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with
the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice
to the Issuer, and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not
eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the
Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six
months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee. Any
removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes or
expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices, warnings, summonses and other communications to the holders of the Notes from the Trustee
shall be sent via NBB-SSS with the request that its Participants are informed with a copy to the Issuer, and
the listing agent, for the purpose of sending to the Exchange (to the extent required by the rules of the
Exchange). Any such notice or communication shall be deemed to be given or made when sent from
NBB-SSS, Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). The Issuer’s written notifications to the holders of
Notes shall be sent through the NBB-SSS with the request that its Participants are informed, with a copy to
the Trustee and the Exchange (to the extent required by the rules of the Exchange).

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the
Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the
applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer with respect to the Notes is
Euro. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, (whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the
Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the holder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the
Issuer will constitute a discharge of the Issuer only to the extent of the Euro amount, which the recipient is
able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it
is possible to do so). If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount, expressed to be due to the recipient
under any Note, the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any
event the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
Euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
currency other than Euro shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such non-Euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Certain Information Reporting Provisions**

**_Mutual Undertaking Regarding Information Reporting and Collection Obligations_**

Each Party to the Indenture (a ‘‘Party’’) shall, within ten business days of a written request by another
Party, supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to it, its
operations, or the Notes as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party’s
compliance with Applicable Law and shall notify the relevant other Party reasonably promptly in the event

244


-----

that it becomes aware that any of the forms, documentation or other information provided by such Party is
(or becomes) inaccurate in any material respect; provided, however, that no Party shall be required to
provide any forms, documentation or other information pursuant to this paragraph to the extent that:
(i) any such form, documentation or other information (or the information required to be provided on
such form or documentation) is not reasonably available to such Party and cannot be obtained by such
Party using reasonable efforts; or (ii) doing so would or might in the reasonable opinion of such Party
constitute a breach of any: (a) Applicable Law; (b) fiduciary duty; or (c) duty of confidentiality. For
purposes of this paragraph, ‘‘Applicable Law’’ shall be deemed to include (i) any rule or practice of any
competent regulatory, prosecuting, Tax or governmental authority by (‘‘Authority’’) which any Party is
bound or with which it is accustomed to comply; (ii) any agreement between any Authorities; and (iii) any
agreement between any Authority and any Party that is customarily entered into by institutions of a similar
nature.

**_Notice of Possible Withholding Under FATCA_**

The Issuer shall notify the Paying Agent in the event that it determines that any payment to be made by the
Paying Agent under the Notes is a payment which could be subject to any withholding or deduction
required pursuant to an agreement described in section 1471(b) of the Code, or otherwise imposed
pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any regulations or agreements thereunder, any official
interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto (‘‘FATCA
**Withholding’’) if such payment were made to a recipient that is generally unable to receive payments free**
from FATCA Withholding, and the extent to which the relevant payment is so treated, provided, however,
that the Issuer’s obligation under this paragraph shall apply only to the extent that such payments are so
treated by virtue of characteristics of the Issuer, the Notes, or both.

**_Paying Agent Right to Withhold_**

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to make a
deduction or withholding from any payment which it makes under the Notes for or on account of any
Taxes, if and only to the extent so required by Applicable Law, in which event the Paying Agent shall make
such payment after such deduction or withholding has been made and shall account to the relevant
Authority within the time allowed for the amount so deducted or withheld or, at its option, shall reasonably
promptly after making such payment return to the Issuer the amount so deducted or withheld, in which
case, the Issuer shall so account to the relevant Authority for such amount. For the avoidance of doubt,
FATCA Withholding is a deduction or withholding which is deemed to be required by Applicable Law for
the purposes of this paragraph.

**_Issuer Right to Redirect_**

In the event that the Issuer determines in its sole discretion that any deduction or withholding for or on
account of any Taxes will be required by Applicable Law in connection with any payment due to any of the
agents on any Notes, then the Issuer will be entitled to redirect or reorganise any such payment in any way
that it sees fit in order that the payment may be made without such deduction or withholding provided
that, any such redirected or reorganised payment is made through a recognised institution of international
standing and otherwise made in accordance with the Indenture. The Issuer will promptly notify the agents
and the Trustee of any such redirection or reorganisation. For the avoidance of doubt, FATCA
Withholding is a deduction or withholding which is deemed to be required by Applicable Law for the
purposes of this paragraph.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption
price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.
See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or
_subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability’’ and_
‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations’’._

245


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New
York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement, will be
governed by the law of England and Wales.

**Certain Definitions**

‘‘Acquired Indebtedness’’ means Indebtedness (1) of a Person or any of its Subsidiaries existing at the time
such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or (2) assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets
from such Person, in each case whether or not Incurred by such Person in connection with such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or such acquisition or (3) of a Person at the time such Person merges
with or into or consolidates or otherwise combines with the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. Except as
otherwise set forth in the Indenture, Acquired Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been Incurred, with
respect to clause (1) of the preceding sentence, on the date such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary
and, with respect to clause (2) of the preceding sentence, on the date of consummation of such acquisition
of assets and, with respect to clause (3) of the preceding sentence, on the date of the relevant merger,
consolidation or other combination.

‘‘Affiliate’’ of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled
by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. For the purposes of this
definition, ‘‘control’’ when used with respect to any Person means the power to direct the management and
policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
contract or otherwise; and the terms ‘‘controlling’’ and ‘‘controlled’’ have meanings correlative to the
foregoing.

‘‘Agreed Security Principles’’ means the agreed security principles appended to the Senior Facilities
Agreement, as of the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date, as applied _mutatis mutandis with respect to the_
Notes in good faith by the Issuer.

‘‘Applicable Premium’’ means, the greater of:

(1) 1% of the principal amount of such Note; and

(2) as of any redemption date, the excess (to the extent positive) of:

(a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Note at January 15,
2023, (such redemption price (expressed in percentage of principal amount) being set forth in the
table under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ (excluding accrued but unpaid interest)), plus (ii) all
required interest payments due on such Note to and including such date (excluding accrued but
unpaid interest), computed upon the redemption date using a discount rate equal to the Bund
Rate at such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over

(b) the outstanding principal amount of such Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate. For the
avoidance of doubt, calculation of the Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the
Trustee, Registrar, Transfer Agent or any Paying Agent.

‘‘Asset Disposition’’ means any direct or indirect sale, lease (other than an Ordinary Course Lease
Obligation entered into in the ordinary course of business), transfer, issuance or other disposition, or a

Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, no cash or Cash Equivalents shall be included in the calculation of
Consolidated Net Leverage to the extent that such cash or Cash Equivalents are the proceeds of
Indebtedness Incurred on the date of determination in respect of which the calculation of the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio is to be made. With respect to the cash and Cash Equivalents credited on the
Distribution Escrow Account, until the Distribution Interim Date the amount of cash and Cash
Equivalents to be taken into account for purposes of this definition at any determination date shall be
limited to an amount corresponding to A67.0 million as reduced by any amounts (if any) already distributed
(or to be distributed on such determination date) out of the Distribution Escrow Amount in connection

Incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any
Indebtedness (other than Incurrences or repayments of ordinary working capital borrowings) subsequent
to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated
and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio is made (the ‘‘Calculation Date’’), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated
giving _pro forma effect (as determined by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer)_
including in respect of anticipated cost savings, expense reductions and cost synergies reasonably expected
to occur within 18 months) to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if
the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; provided, however, that (except
with respect to calculations made pursuant to clause (17) of the third paragraph under ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’) the_ _pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (i) any_
Indebtedness Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second
paragraph under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (other than clause (5)(ii) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’) or
(ii) the discharge on the Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results

_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’._

related financing transactions and including increases in ownership of Restricted Subsidiaries, during
the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the

253


-----

Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as
determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial Officer of the Issuer), including in
respect of anticipated cost savings, expense reductions and cost synergies reasonably expected to occur
within 18 months, as if they had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period;
_provided that, if definitive documentation has been entered into with respect to a Purchase that is part_
of the transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period
will be calculated after giving _pro forma effect to such Purchase (including anticipated cost savings,_
expense reductions and cost synergies reasonably expected to occur within 18 months) as if such
Purchase had occurred on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been
consummated as of the date of determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a
business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date,
will be excluded on a _pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period_
(taking into account anticipated cost savings resulting from any such disposal, as determined by a
responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer);

(3) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS,
and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership
interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if
such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the obligations
giving rise to such Fixed Charges will not be obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any
Indebtedness is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes
of the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS; and

(7) the full run-rate effect of cost savings, expense reductions and cost synergies (as determined in good

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND**
**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Note Guarantees in each of
the jurisdictions in which Note Guarantees are being provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of
bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the
jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in
multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, and could adversely
affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in EU jurisdiction and
Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the
Guarantors, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or
similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**European Union**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings, recast (the ‘‘Insolvency Regulation’’), which applies within the European Union
(other than Denmark), the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s ‘‘center of main interests’’ (as
that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence
main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor.

The center of main interest is defined as the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its
interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. In the case of a debtor or legal
person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the center of its main interests in the
absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been
moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of
insolvency proceedings (as defined in Article (4) of the Insolvency Regulation).

The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the
courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

A debtor’s center of main interests is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is
determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency
proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In that respect, factors such as where board
meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business and the perception
of the debtor’s creditors as regards to the local center of the debtor’s business operations may all be
relevant in the determination of the place where the debtor has its ‘‘center of main interests’’. Accordingly,
and as the presumption that the registered office is the center of main interests is rebuttable, the relevant
court of a Member State must carefully assess whether the center of the debtor’s main interests is
genuinely located in that Member State. It may be possible to rebut this presumption where the debtor’s
central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a
comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third
parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its
interests is located in that other Member State.

If the center of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation with
these proceedings being governed by the _lex fori concursus, i.e. the local laws of the court opening such_
main insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the
Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark),
although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If the center of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2)
of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction
to commence secondary territorial insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an
‘‘establishment’’ (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the
territory of such other Member State. An ‘‘establishment’’ is defined to mean a place of operations where
the debtor carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods.

281


-----

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its center of
main interests, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor
has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to ‘‘winding up proceedings’’ listed in Annex A
of the Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the
debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its center of main interests have not
yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State
where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in
the Member State in which the debtor’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law;
or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim
arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the
Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority which,
under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right
to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are
main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be
governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e. the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction
over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as
no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court
in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s center of
main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in
another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to
certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State
or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency
proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

Following the entry into force of the Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations
where there has been a recent center of main interests shift. Where a company’s center of main interests
has shifted in the preceding 3 months the rebuttable presumption that its center of main interests is at the
place of its registered office will no longer apply. Also, the opening of secondary proceedings in another
EU Member State—which will no longer be limited only to ‘‘winding-up proceedings’’—will be possible
not only if the debtor has an establishment in such EU Member State at the time of the opening of main
insolvency proceedings, but also if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the threemonth period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Guarantors’ subsidiaries
experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.
Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer
and the Guarantors.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency_**

Some Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Belgium (the ‘‘Belgian Guarantors’’). To the extent
any Belgian Guarantor has its registered seat in Belgium or to the extent that Belgium is the territory in
which the center of a Belgian Guarantor’s main interests is situated, main insolvency proceedings may be
initiated in Belgium. This also applies to any debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the center
of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law.
Under certain circumstances, the Insolvency Regulation and Belgian law also allows secondary bankruptcy
proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose center of main interests is not
situated in Belgium. The effects of those secondary bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the assets
situated in Belgium.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Belgian insolvency law of August 11, 2017 (as
incorporated in Book XX (‘‘Insolvency of Undertakings’’) of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, hereafter
the ‘‘Belgian Insolvency Law’’). The Belgian Insolvency Law provides for two insolvency proceedings:
judicial reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/r´eorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy

282


-----

proceedings (faillissement/faillite). Note that in addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit
(deficitaire vereffening/liquidation d´eficitaire). The latter proceedings will not be further discussed.

In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, a (likely to get approved) legislative proposal is currently pending at
Belgium’s House of Representatives which would re-introduce a temporary stay or ‘‘moratorium’’ on
enforcement and insolvency proceedings. It is expected that the moratorium would apply from its date of
publication up until (and including) January 31, 2021 to all enterprises subject to the closure measures
imposed by the Ministerial Decree of October 28, 2020 containing urgent measures to limit the spread of
Covid-19, amended by the Ministerial Decree of November 1, 2020, whose continuity is threatened by the
Covid-19 pandemic and which were not in a state of cessation of payments before March 18, 2020. The
moratorium includes measures such as (i) a temporary stay of bankruptcy proceedings, judicial winding up,
and forced transfer under judicial supervision of whole or part of a company’s activities (ii) protection of
new credit provided during the moratorium against the hardening period in subsequent bankruptcy
proceedings (iii) a temporary stay of conservatory or executory attachments and means of enforcement for,
in principle, all new and old debts of the company, both principal amounts and accrued interests, with
exceptions for immovable property and seagoing and inland vessels (iv) a temporary stay of dissolution of
agreements on grounds of non-payment of a monetary debt that is due and payable, with exceptions for
employment contracts; and (v) an extension of the payment periods included in a homologated judicial
reorganisation plan for a period equal to the duration of the temporary moratorium.

_Judicial reorganization_

A debtor may (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor)
file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately
or in the future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered
capital, the continuity of the enterprise is presumed to be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the debtor does
not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed.

As from the filing of the petition with the competent commercial court overseeing the judicial
reorganization and for as long as such court has not issued a judgment thereon, the debtor cannot be
declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court
order. Furthermore, during this period, with limited exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be realized
by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold
with respect to such assets. The filing of the petition does not, however, have a suspensory effect if the
debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than six months ago (unless the
court decides otherwise).

Within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will examine such petition, and
within 8 days following such examination and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court
may decide to open the judicial reorganization procedure, thereby, granting a temporary moratorium to
the debtor for a period of maximum six months. At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial
administrator in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued
by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended (once or several times) up to a
total maximum period of twelve months as from the judgment opening the judicial reorganization. In
exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact
of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional
extension of the moratorium period for six months. Special rules apply when a debtor has already
requested and obtained a judicial reorganization procedure in the last 3 years before the new request.

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to
pre-existing claims (i.e. for debts incurred before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization
proceedings) in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s moveable and
immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with limited
exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims.
During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the
debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their
conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a
material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of
moveable or immoveable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be
continued.

283


-----

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial
reorganization proceedings, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium (provided the receivables
are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment the pledge is created) (note that a pledge of a
business or other universality including receivables is not considered as a pledge specifically with respect to
receivables), and the holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against
the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (e.g., the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A
pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law of
December 15, 2004, as amended (Wet Financi¨ele Zekerheden/Loi sur les Sˆuret´es Financi`eres) (the ‘‘Belgian
**Financial Collateral Law’’) can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the**
moratorium, subject to limited exceptions. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the
debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the
debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted
by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims
covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise.
However, in respect of an enforcement over pledged cash falling within the scope of the Belgian Collateral
Act, the enforcement prohibition applies, with limited exceptions (notably in the event of a payment
default), if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or
financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity
but the creditor is not such an entity.

During judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue
to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon
request of the debtor, the court may appoint, a company mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/m´ediateur
_d’entreprise) to assist the debtor during the moratorium and to facilitate the reorganization of the company_
or of all or part of its assets or activities. The court may also appoint a judicial administrator
(gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice), upon request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, in
the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies threatening the
continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can
preserve such continuity, to either exercise particular tasks indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor
or any of its corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium. In addition, in the event of manifestly
gross error or manifest bad faith, a court appointed temporary director (voorlopig bestuurder/administrateur
_provisoire) may be appointed._

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern.
Consequently, the initiation of the judicial reorganization proceedings does not terminate any contracts,
and contractual provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the
initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest,
may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few
exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a
corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Law or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but where the creditor is not such an entity.
Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis
of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such
default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract
during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and that such default
is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or
part of the enterprise or its assets. The exercise of this right does however not prevent the creditor from
suspending in turn the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the
agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations.

_Judicial reorganization by collective agreement, by amicable settlement or by court ordered transfer of_
_enterprise_

Judicial reorganization proceedings may result in an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or
more of its creditors, a collective agreement or a transfer of (part of) its activities.

The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the
court and all parties involved.

284


-----

In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the
terms they have agreed. Such in-court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The
debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation
to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will
record it. Such an amicable settlement will remain enforceable in the event of a later bankruptcy, subject to
certain exceptions. The court order confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be published,
without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that
have agreed to it.

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan
during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling
of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity (the Belgian Insolvency Law contains
certain limitations, primarily in view of protecting employees of the debtor) and may be based on a
differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. It must be filed with the electronic
registry managed by the Belgian bar association (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on
which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan. The court needs to ratify the
reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the
creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including
those who voted against it or did not vote. The reorganization plan can bind creditors who have a
contractual lien over specific assets, pledgees, mortgagees and the so-called creditor-owners, provided that
(i) interest is paid on the principal amount of their outstanding debts, and (ii) their rights are not
suspended for more than 24 months as of the ratification of the collective agreement by the court. No
other measures can be imposed on such creditors without their individual agreement. The court may refuse
ratification if the conditions of the judicial reorganization act were not met, or if the proposed
reorganization plan violates public policy.

Within a period of eight days following the judgment opening the judicial reorganization proceedings, the
debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as
recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of the capacity of the creditor as extraordinary creditor and
of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other
interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured
claims declared by the debtor at the latest one month prior to the day on which the creditors vote on the
reorganization plan. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a
preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure, or definitively, on the condition that it
has jurisdiction in that respect but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently
short time frame. In addition, the court can at any moment, in the event of absolute necessity and upon the
request of the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the
claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim
at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the
reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the
purposes of the reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the
assistance of the court appointed judicial administrator or company mediator, as the case may be. The plan
may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the
swap of debt into equity and may be based on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain
various categories of liabilities.

The court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its
petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It may also be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor
or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court
can order such transfer in specific circumstances.

The court-ordered transfer will be organized by one or more judicial administrators. Following the
transfer, the recourse of the creditors will in most cases be limited to the transfer price.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the
Public Prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the
debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of ‘main insolvency proceedings’ opened in another EU member state
(other than Denmark) in accordance with the Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the

285


-----

requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be
submitted to the court for verification.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/declaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a
situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de
_paiements de mani`ere persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/_
_´ebranlement du cr´edit). Cessation of payments is generally considered as the inability of the debtor to pay_
its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the
debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The
bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of
the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to
creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being
informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver.
Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the
temporary continued operation of the business.

In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the
bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes
responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the
distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. Subject to what follows, the
rights of creditors in the process are in principle limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy
proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver. Creditors may oppose to the sale of assets by
bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business.

The bankruptcy must decide whether or not to temporarily continue performance under ongoing contracts
(i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the
business of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such
continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes
an early termination or acceleration event; and

- _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an_
essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy
judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can
however agree to continue to perform under such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to
be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to
the bankruptcy if such decision is necessary for the management and the liquidation of the bankrupt estate.
The counterparty to an ongoing contract may summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision within
15 days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if the bankruptcy receiver does not take any
decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. The
counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank
_pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant_
contract dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the
contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the
court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver
may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a
pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account, falling with the scope of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Law. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate credits (boedelschulden / dettes de la masse).

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets (other than financial collateral), such suspension
would normally be limited to the period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the
bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year as from the bankruptcy
judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court which can only be made if the further
suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the
secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by
the court. However, a pledge on financial instrument or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the
suspension period.

286


-----

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is
necessary to pursue the sale of the assets, subject to certain exceptions. The bankruptcy receiver will do so
upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking
mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of
claims has been finalized. The court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year
from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without
prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the
court.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an
insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such
security shall, in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such
insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on
its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax administration or social
securitydebts.

The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The
following is a general overview of such rules:

- Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the bankruptcy
proceedings, the so-called ‘‘estate debts’’, have a senior priority. In addition, if the bankruptcy receiver
has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the
bankruptcy receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the
remainder to the secured creditors.

- Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset
(whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

- Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for
social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the
debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests.

- _Pari passu: Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges_
have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the bankruptcy receiver
among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).

- Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

**_Limitations on Enforcement of the Notes and the Guarantees_**

The grant of a guarantee by a Belgian company for the obligations of another group company must fall
within the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit of the granting
company.

If the granting of a guarantee does not fall within the grantor’s corporate purpose, then such guarantee
could, upon certain conditions, be held null and void. The assessment of whether or not the grant of a
guarantee is in each of the Belgian guarantor’s own corporate interest, is largely dependent on factual
considerations and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the board of directors or director(s) of
each of the Belgian guarantors at the time of the granting of the guarantees, in anticipation of their
enforcement and to be reviewed ultimately on a case-by-case basis at the time of the enforcement by the
competent courts. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that such Belgian
guarantor would derive from the transaction; this is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream
guarantees. It is generally considered by legal scholars that at least the following principles apply to such
evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the Belgian guarantor in issuing the guarantee must be proportional to the
direct and/or indirect benefit derived from the transaction; and (ii) the financial support granted by the
Belgian guarantor should not exceed its financial capabilities. The responsibility for such assessment lies
with the board of directors or manager(s) of the Belgian guarantors.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the board of directors or manager(s) of the Belgian
guarantor may be held liable (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and
(ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances, i.e. where the specific
facts can be qualified as ‘‘abuse of company goods’’ (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de biens

287


-----

_sociaux). Moreover, the guarantee could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the_
creditor that benefits from the guarantee may also be held liable on the basis of the principles of tort
liability. Alternatively, the guarantee could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate
benefit and, under certain circumstances, the creditor could be held liable on the basis of the principles of
tort liability for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount. These rules have however seldom been
tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee for liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or
sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market
practice for indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to contain so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in
relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indenture will contain,
and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement do contain, limitation
language on the basis of which the total maximum guarantee liabilities of certain Belgian guarantors (in
case of an upstream or cross stream guarantee) under the Indenture will be limited.

**_Financial Assistance_**

Any guarantee granted by a Belgian Guarantor which constitutes a breach of the provisions on financial
assistance as defined by article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations,
whichever is applicable, might not be enforceable.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event that bankruptcy proceedings are governed by Belgian law, certain transactions may be
declared ineffective against third parties if concluded or performed by the debtor during the so-called
‘‘hardening period’’ (verdachte periode/p´eriode suspecte).

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed
to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may
determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an
earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order,
except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six
months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its
creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such
decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration
of bankruptcy is referred to as the ‘‘hardening period’’.

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective
against third parties and are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among others,
(i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue or on extremely beneficial terms
for the counterparty, (ii) payments for debts which are not yet due, and (iii) payments other than in cash
for debts due, and (iv) new security interests provided for pre-existing debts.

The Belgian bankruptcy receiver may request the court to declare payments of a Belgian Guarantor during
the hardening period for debts due ineffective against third parties provided that it can be proven that the
creditor concerned was aware of the cessation of payment of the company. If the guarantee granted by a
Belgian Guarantor were successfully held ineffective (based on the above), noteholders would cease to
have any claim in respect thereof and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received
pursuant to such guarantee.

Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third party creditor may obtain a court
ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that
the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as
an existing creditor (actio pauliana).

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

Courts may condition the enforcement of guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and
undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the guarantee. Enforcement of guarantees may be hindered
by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision
and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the
English documents which they may review.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Guarantors is organized under the laws of Germany, has its registered offices in Germany and,
except for shareholding interests in certain subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets are located in
Germany (the ‘‘German Guarantor’’). Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the German
Guarantor are likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the German Guarantor was held to have its center
of main interests within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such
proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency
Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions,
including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and
the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover
payments due on the Note Guarantees, as applicable, to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under
other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite
the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate
insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the
part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other
insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and
liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective
entities of a group. Recently, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group
insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bew¨altigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on
April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency
proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency
proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key
amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group
insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the
appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated;
(iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for ‘‘coordination proceedings’’
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a ‘‘coordination insolvency administrator’’
(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a ‘‘coordination plan’’ (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
_ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency_
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of
over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts
as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its
assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern
is predominantly likely (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich) at least for the current and the subsequent fiscal year
(positive Fortf¨uhrungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or
more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that
the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demn¨achst) and it can be deemed acceptable to
the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or
a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung—GmbH)—such as the German
Guarantor—or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder becomes illiquid
and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders
are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest
within three (3) weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason, _i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness,_
occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as
well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments may be
voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason
under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will

289


-----

presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period.
However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of
insolvency proceedings if the debtor is likely to not be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in
the Case of Insolvency Caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (the
‘‘COVInsAG’’), provided initially for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until
September 30, 2020. The suspension applied unless the insolvency was not caused by consequences of the
Covid-19 pandemic or there was no prospect of remedying the existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). If
the debtor was able to pay its debts on December 31, 2019, so that the debtor was not illiquid
(zahlungsf¨ahig), it was assumed that the insolvency was caused by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and
that there were prospects of remedying an existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). The COVInsAG also
provided that insolvency proceedings based on creditors’ insolvency filings during the period from
March 28, 2020 to June 28, 2020 could only be opened if the event of illiquidity or over-indebtedness
already existed on March 1, 2020. In the meantime, the German legislature has extended the suspension
for a period starting from October 1, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2020, with such extension only
applying to companies which are over-indebted (¨uberschuldet), but not illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig). In
addition, the COVInsAG also provides for relief from claw-back for the satisfaction of claims or the
provision of collateral for claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive, unless the creditor knew that
the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable (Insolvenzordnung).

During the suspension of filing obligations as set out in the preceding paragraph, the COVInsAG also
provides for relief from lender liability, as any new loans or the provision of collateral for such loans is not
regarded to be against bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). This relief includes deferrals and ‘‘amend & extend’’
transactions.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures (vorl¨aufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings _(Insolvenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures_
taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In
addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator _(vorl¨aufiger_
_Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an_
insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the
debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian _(Sachwalter)—with this petition not being_
obviously futile. The rights and duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator depend on the decision
of the court and may be, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s property (which includes
the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason
and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency
proceedings. Upon appointment of the preliminary insolvency administrator, the insolvency court may also
order that the debtor can only dispose over its assets with the consent of the preliminary insolvency
administrator or the court may order that the power to dispose over the assets shall fully pass to the
preliminary insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement
measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor.

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and the number of its employees, the insolvency
court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorl¨aufiger Gl¨aubigerausschuss) to form a
view on the profile of the officeholder to be appointed or eve4n to make a succestion for a particular
individual to be appointed by the court.

In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such
suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or
not impartial). The preliminary creditors’ committee will also have the power to, inter alia, influence
orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung) and appointments for
preliminary trustees (Sachwalter).

To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it
should and usually does comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and
one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency
administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which may include the
continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and
to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings.

290


-----

The court orders the opening (Er¨offnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (er¨offnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets_
(Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not
expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties
(e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not
necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the
insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a
debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets
of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) only
being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first
creditors’ assembly (erste Gl¨aubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of
votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual
becoming the insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e.,
sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new
financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities
incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate
(Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the
residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if
any) also being as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such
opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that
are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

- the right to administer and dispose of the assets of such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries
would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the
insolvency estate, unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung);

- if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such German
Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of such German
Guarantor or such subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by
operation of law;

- if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of such German Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ property that would
normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law
upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings;

- claims against such German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in
accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

- any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person
does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, such as creditors with retention of title) does not
participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of
ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ‘‘escape clauses’’
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the
occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene K¨undigungsrechte
_oder L¨osungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator_
whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination
rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate to agreements that are not governed by
German law.

Moreover, powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to
be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become
unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

291


-----

Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) as opposed to a right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction
(Absonderungsrecht), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the
insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may
generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead
only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).
Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the
insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential
rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce
such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it
should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable
assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets
(Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungs¨ubereignung)) as well as to collect any
claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement
right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory
charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured
assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds
plus value added tax (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant
collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the
debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegl¨aubiger)
first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the
insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims
(insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured insolvency creditors and
residual claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after realization of the available collateral (if any),
will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled
and paid in full.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the
relevant debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who
becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank
senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency
proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated
creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under
‘‘—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims’’.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of any Guarantor’s or any of their relevant
subsidiaries’ assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s
business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken
based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency
administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of such
Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance
with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors
or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity,
also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the
insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer or issuance to creditors
based on a debt-to-equity swap. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity
swap with regards to the debt owed to it by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors
secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with
regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public
auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case law, it is uncertain

292


-----

whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged
shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency
administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors.
Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator,
the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as
described above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an
amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described
above) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential
unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security
interests, the holders of the security interests. If a German subsidiary or a subsidiary subject to German
insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such
security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting
from such collateral securing creditors other than the holders of the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy
the holders of the securities under the Note Guarantees granted by the German Guarantors after
satisfaction of such secured creditors.

Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an
insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a
petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring
of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three
months to prepare an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During this period, the
creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under
these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a preliminary custodian (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter) to
supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with
such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible
to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial).

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession
proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed
detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are
successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other
benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the
insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the
circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to any
Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany,
the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as the providing credit support for the
benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency
administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). To the extent such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the
Notes may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Note Guarantees and may participate in
the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the
Note Guarantees, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid
to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the Notes, as applicable, would only
have a general unsecured claim under the Note Guarantees, as applicable, without preference in
insolvency proceedings.

Against this background, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which term
includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the
creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in
particular in the following cases:

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of

293


-----

the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity
or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that compellingly suggest such illiquidity or filing);

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled, if such act was taken (i) during
the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after
such filing, (ii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was
illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was
taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of
circumstances that compellingly suggest such detrimental effect);

- a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing
of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of
such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or
(ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to
such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction;

- any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a
third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was
effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

- any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of
prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vors¨atzliche Gl¨aubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the
act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or
enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to
four years; ‘‘knowledge by the beneficiary of the act’’ in terms of such provision is presumed if the
beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) and that the
relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a
creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was
entitled, the ‘‘knowledge by the beneficiary of the act’’ is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the
debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged
the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to
deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at
this time;

- any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier
than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other
party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the
contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘‘affiliated party’’ includes, subject
to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and
shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor,
and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing
persons;

- any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment
of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place
during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year
prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of
such petition; or

- any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to
a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted
security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder B¨urge) (in which case the shareholder must
compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

294


-----

In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or
intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge
of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or
imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With
respect to an ‘‘affiliated party,’’ there is a general statutory presumption that such party had ‘‘knowledge.’’

The COVInsAG, however, provides for the privileged treatment of any kind of newly granted thirdparty
financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commitment credits and other forms of financing)
and shareholder loans under the avoidance provisions of German insolvency law. Thus, the repayment
(including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financings and shareholder loans by September 30,
2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between
March 1, 2020 and originally September 20, 2020 (as described above, this period has been extended until
December 31, 2020 in case of sole over-indebtedness) and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the
suspension of the filing duties. His privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favor of third-party
financing providers, but does not apply to the provision of collateral to secure a shareholder loan or
receivables from economically similar acts.

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a ‘‘cash transaction’’
and may as such be privileged i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargesch¨aftsprivileg).

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement
order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of
execution, under certain circumstances could possibly also void any security right or payment performed
under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside
formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above
and the voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the
courts.

If any Notes Guarantee is challenged or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease
to have any claim in respect of the Notes Guarantee and would have a claim solely under the Notes and
the remaining Note Guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been
challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In addition, under German law, a creditor
who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may
be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances
indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such
security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the
case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of
the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such
intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating
that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had
reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

Moreover, please note that according to the certain amendments (‘‘Gesetz zur Verbesserung der
Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und dem Anfechtungsgesetz vom 29. M¨arz
2017’’) of the Insolvency Code that came into force on April 5, 2017, among other things, the provisions for
avoidance claims in connection with willful intent, for cash transactions (Bargesch¨afte) and the interest
rates on avoidance claims have been amended. The German insolvency laws may be subject to further
amendments in the near future. On June 20, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of
debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning
restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the
‘‘Restructuring Directive’’) was adopted. The member states have approximately two years to transpose the
substantive parts of the Restructuring Directive into their national legislation, although a one-year
extension can be granted. The Restructuring Directive aims to put in place key principles for all members
states on, among other things, effective preventive restructuring and measures to make all types of
insolvency procedures more efficient. The key feature of the Restructuring Directive is the introduction of
a preventive restructuring framework, for which the Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU

295


-----

standards to be applied by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization). The Restructuring Directive
leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of certain other features. Most notably,
the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which claims of the relevant creditors
may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the
amount of claims in each class and where applicable, a majority of creditors in a pre-insolvency
restructuring proceeding, (i.e. outside formal insolvency proceedings). The Restructuring Directive also
provides for cross-class cram-down (i.e. even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan
did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan may still be
adopted and take effect). In addition, the Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement. The
implementation of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking
for new financings.

Finally, the insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors
against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be
satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to
the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on
the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by
individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines,
coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or
administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance
of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a loan replacing equity capital or claims resulting from
legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. The COVInsAG, however, suspends the
statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency
proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between
March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (as described above, this period has been extended until
December 31, 2020 in the case of sole over-indebtedness) and where the debtor fulfilled the requirements
for the suspension of filing duties.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the
debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied
ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the
proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the
claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs
incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines,
regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a
criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous
performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for repayment of a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to
such a loan.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantee_**

The granting of guarantees by German Guarantors will be subject to certain German capital maintenance
rules of the German Act regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften
_mit beschr¨ankter Haftung) (the ‘‘GmbHG’’) if that Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the legal form_
of a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung—a ‘‘GmbH’’) or a German
limited partnership with a German limited liability company as general partner (a ‘‘GmbH & Co. KG’’). As
a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (‘‘Sections 30 and 31’’) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing
its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets less
liabilities and liability reserves)—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or
would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share
capital (Begr¨undung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co.
KG in order to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered
disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant
guarantees to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating
Sections 30 and 31 and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market
practice for credit agreements, indentures and guarantees to contain so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in
relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG.

296


-----

Pursuant to such ‘‘limitation language’’, the beneficiaries of the guarantees contractually agree to enforce
the guarantees against the German subsidiary only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not
result in the subsidiary’s—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net assets falling
below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital and thereby violating sections 30,
31 GmbHG.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Indenture, to the extent provided by a Guarantor
incorporated in Germany in a relevant corporate form as described above, contain or will contain a
contractual limitation language and the enforcement of such guarantees will be limited in the manner
described above. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee granted by such
Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court
rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Guarantors constituted in the
form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors
to make payments on the related guarantees.

Furthermore, the enforcement of a guarantee granted by a German Guarantor may be excluded (entirely)
in case the granting or enforcement of such guarantee and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence of
a claim by any beneficiary of such guarantee resulted or would result in any personal liability of the
relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called ‘‘destructive interference’’ (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a
situation where a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment
obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee granted by a German
Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced,
potentially even to zero.

According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement
may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed
financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by
disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts
may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees by any of the German Guarantors.
Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the
grantor of the guarantee could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor
were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor
in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the
beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee
was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency_**

Provided that the Netherlands is the territory in which the center of a Dutch Guarantor’s main interests is
situated, main insolvency proceedings would likely be initiated in the Netherlands and conducted in
accordance with the requirements of Dutch insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the Insolvency
Regulation, where a Dutch legal entity conducts business in another EU member state, the jurisdiction of
the Dutch courts may be limited if the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of such legal entity is found to be in
another EU member state. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in
the Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not established under
Dutch law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two
primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is
intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a
going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and
distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the
Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in
bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below.

297


-----

**_Suspension of Payments_**

An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will
be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a
court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator
(bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft
composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments,
the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium.
If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional
moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more
than one-quarter in the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more
than one-third in the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured
non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be
withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of
payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.

The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under
Dutch law, secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce
their rights against assets of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were
no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does
not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the court
can order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be
extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by
secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition
(akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and
non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority in the number of creditors represented
at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and
admitted in the suspension, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the
aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and
payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. During a Dutch
bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the
debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle
of Dutch insolvency law is the _paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all_
creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be
distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured
creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of
other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch
bankruptcy proceeding.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in
accordance with its terms. Each claim will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be
verified. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and
whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the
distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the
time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall
due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims
submitted by any of the company’s creditors may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and
all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or
value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings
(renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause creditors to recover less than the principal amount of
their claim. Such _renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to holders of disputed claims to be_
delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims.

As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered
to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple

298


-----

majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in
amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed
by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of
classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential
creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata
basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings.
The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch
bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge
(rechter-commissaris) can order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ for a maximum of two months (which can be
extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors
are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Further,
a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable
period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured
creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. Excess proceeds
of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured
claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set-off relating to a
payment to the pledgor, not made during its bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders
of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a set-off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback
in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off.

Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without
limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third
party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party’s obligations, enters into
additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can
be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its
trustee in bankruptcy.

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of
judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to
secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law.
Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds
resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors
after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the
date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

**_Restructurings_**

On October 6, 2020 the Dutch legislator has adopted a bill for the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord), with the aim to implement a
restructuring instrument enabling companies in financial distress to restructure their debts without the
need to initiate formal insolvency procedures (such as bankruptcy or suspension of payments). The bill will
enter into force on January 1, 2021.

The goal of the new legislation is to introduce a preventive restructuring procedure enabling debtors in
financial difficulties to restructure at an early stage and avoid insolvency. A restructuring plan under the
new legislation can be proposed by a debtor who foresees that it will not be able to continue paying its due
and payable debts (the debts as they fall due). Under such circumstances, the debtor or a court appointed
restructuring specialist may offer a restructuring plan to the debtor’s creditors and shareholders. A
restructuring plan could propose an amendment or (partial) discharge of the rights and claims of all
creditors and shareholders involved.

Once approved and confirmed by the relevant percentage of creditors and the court, such restructuring
plan is binding on all creditors and shareholders involved. Subject to certain safeguards, creditors and
shareholders who have voted against the restructuring plan could be (cross-) crammed down and thus be
bound by the restructuring plan. Taking into account the provisions in the act, claims against a debtor can,
_inter alia, be (partially) discharged or extended as a result of a restructuring plan if the relevant majority of_
creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favour of such a plan and the court subsequently
approves the plan.

299


-----

**_COVID measures_**

A new draft legislation, the Temporary Act COVID 19 Ministry of Social Affairs and Ministry of Justice
(Tijdelijke wet COVID-19 SZW en JV), has been recently adopted by the Dutch Legislator (Staten_Generaal). Although adopted by the Dutch Legislator, it is still uncertain when the legislation will enter_
into force. However, it is expected that this legislation will come into effect before the stated maturity date
of the Notes. Under the temporary act a debtor would (amongst others) be entitled to request the court for
suspension of enforcement measures and/or any court decisions concerning bankruptcy petitions. The
court may grant such request of the debtor under certain specific circumstances, such as either (i) a
suspension is necessary for continuation of the company’s activities, or (ii) it is summarily evidenced that
the current financial situation is mainly (or entirely) caused by the measures imposed as from March 16
2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as a result of which the company is temporarily unable to pay
its debts, and it is evidenced that the financial situation of the company before the COVID-19 outbreak
was normal and is expected to improve in the (near) future. If approved, such suspension would be initially
granted for two months and could be extended by up to two additional suspension periods of two months
each.

**_Security general defenses and corporate benefit_**

If a Dutch company enters into a legal act (rechtshandeling) (such as the granting of a guarantee), the
validity and enforceability of the relevant transaction may be contested by the Dutch company or its
administrator (bewindvoerder) in a suspension of payments or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy, on the
basis of the ultra vires (doeloverschrijding) provisions of Section 2:7 of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk
_Wetboek) which give legal entities the right to nullify a legal act entered into if (i) such act exceeded_
(overschreden) its objects (doel) and (ii) the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this
without independent investigation. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee is in furtherance of
the objects of the relevant Dutch company, a Dutch court would not only consider the text of the objects
clause in the articles of association of the Dutch company but also all relevant circumstances, including
whether the granting of a guarantee is in the corporate interests (vennootschappelijke belang) of the Dutch
company derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the granting of a
guarantee was granted and any indirect benefit derived by the relevant Dutch company as a consequence
of the interdependence of it with the group of companies to which it belongs and whether or not the
subsistence of the relevant Dutch company is jeopardized by conducting such transaction. The mere fact
that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly mentioned in the objects clause in the articles of
association of the company does not constitute conclusive evidence to state that such legal act is in the
corporate interests and that such legal act (rechtshandeling) cannot be deemed to be ultra vires.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a gurantee granted by a legal entity may, under certain circumstances,
be nullified by any of its creditors, if (i) the guarantee was granted without prior existing legal obligation to
do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned was/were prejudiced as a consequence of the granting the
guarantee, and (iii) at the time the guarantee was granted both the legal entity and, unless the guarantee
was granted for no consideration (anders dan om niet), the beneficiary of the guarantee knew or should
have known that one or more of the entity’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio
_pauliana). Also, to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee may be nullified by the_
receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case
the beneficiary of the guarantee is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that
creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for
no consideration.

The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply _mutatis_
_mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy._

In addition, the receiver may challenge the guarantee if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal
obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee was granted at a time that the
beneficiary of such guarantee knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed, or (ii) if such guarantee
was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee with a
view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of
any guarantee granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge
would be successful.

**_General Limitations on Enforcement_**

If a Dutch Guarantor grants a guarantee and that guarantee is not in the company’s corporate interest, the
guarantee may be nullified by the relevant Dutch Guarantor, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in
bankruptcy (faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in suspension of payment proceedings
(surseance van betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against
it. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee is in the interest of a Dutch Guarantor, Dutch
courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the
company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of
the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the
guarantee was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit
it derives from such transaction. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient,
commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company
(and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the enforcement of the guarantee, and it is possible that such
challenge would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit
derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of
companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the
guarantee, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such
guarantee. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists,
the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee cannot serve the
realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to
the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the
other hand. The above also applies with respect to any guarantee granted or other legal act entered into by
a Dutch Guarantor.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was
executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or
mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a
guarantee may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen
circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet-toerekenbare tekortkoming) or
reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include dissolution
(ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise
Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam)
on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company, as well as on the
motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant
Dutch Guarantor. Likewise, the guarantee itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual
payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the
company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably
ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to
meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the
creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the
director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently
(voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**Securities Settlement System Operated by the National Bank of Belgium**

The NBB is the central bank of Belgium. The NBB operates the NBB-SSS for, inter alia, corporate debt
securities that can be traded on a fungible basis in accordance with the Belgian Coordinated Royal Decree
Number 62 of November 10, 1967 governing the custody of transferable financial instruments and the
settlement of transactions on these instruments.

The NBB-SSS is accessible through those of its participants whose membership extends to securities such
as the Notes. Investors and financial intermediaries can hold Notes within securities accounts opened with
qualifying participants. Qualifying participants include most Belgian banks, some Luxembourg banks,
Belgian investment firms, Euroclear and Clearstream. For a description of the tax implications of the
clearing of the Notes through the NBB-SSS, see ‘‘Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Belgian Tax
_Considerations’’._

**General**

The Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will
initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (a
‘‘Rule 144A Global Note’’). The Notes sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under
the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest
coupons attached (a ‘‘Regulation S Global Note’’ and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the
‘‘Global Notes’’).

The Global Notes were deposited by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Issuer with the NBB as operator of
the NBB-SSS on the Issue Date. Upon receipt of the Global Notes, the account of the Paying Agent was
credited by the NBB with an amount equivalent to the principal amount of the Global Notes. On the Issue
Date, the Paying Agent on behalf of the NBB credited the securities accounts of the participants in the
NBB-SSS, including Euroclear and/or Clearstream, with an amount equivalent to their respective portion
of the principal amount of the Global Notes. Following confirmation of the payment to the Issuer of the
gross proceeds for the issue of the Notes, the Paying Agent credited the holders of ownership interests in
the Global Notes (the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) by crediting their securities accounts as participants of
Euroclear and Clearstream, in accordance with the principal amount of Notes purchased by them.

**Book-Entry Interests**

Book-Entry Interests are held by their holders through the participants in the NBB-SSS, including
Euroclear and Clearstream, and through other financial intermediaries which in turn hold the Notes
through Euroclear, Clearstream or other participants in the NBB-SSS. For a full list of participating
central securities depositories as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, see
https://www.nbb.be/en/list-nbb-investor-icsds. Book-Entry Interests are shown on records maintained by
the participants in the NBB-SSS (including Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants). The laws of
certain jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those
securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge
Book-Entry Interests.

Transfers of Book-Entry Interests will be effected only through records maintained by the NBB-SSS,
Euroclear and Clearstream or other NBB-SSS participants and in accordance with the applicable
procedures of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear and Clearstream or other NBB-SSS participants. Transfers
between investors will be effected in accordance with the respective rules and operating procedures of the
participants through which they hold their Notes. Except under the limited circumstances described below,
Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Participants must rely on the procedures of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear and Clearstream and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of NBB-SSS, Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders
of Notes under the Indenture. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any
aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

None of the Issuer, the Paying Agent or any of its agents, or the Trustee or any of its agents has any
responsibility, or is liable, for the proper performance by the NBB-SSS or its participants of their
obligations under their respective rules and operating procedures. The Issuer will have no responsibility or

302


-----

liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, the Notes within the NBB-SSS. The
Issuer’s obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has paid the NBB-SSS or the participants in the
NBB-SSS, as applicable and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter
transmitted through the Notes of the NBB-SSS and custodians or intermediaries.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests held will receive definitive notes in
registered form (‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’) if:

(1) the National Bank of Belgium notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) the National Bank of Belgium so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through the
NBB-SSS, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the
Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue, and the Trustee will authenticate or cause to be authenticated, the
Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations,
requested by or on behalf of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear and/or Clearstream as applicable (in accordance
with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting
the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or
applicable law.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Note (including principal, premium, if any,
interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent for onward
payment through the NBB-SSS to the participants in the NBB-SSS, including Euroclear and/or
Clearstream.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Trustee will treat the persons
shown in the records of the NBB-SSS as having interests in the Global Notes as the owner thereof for the
purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of us, the Paying Agent, the
Registrar, the Trustee or any of its agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

- any other matters relating to the actions and practices of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of Book-Entry Interests to such Notes through the NBB-SSS in euro.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are listed on the Official List. Transfers of interests in the
Global Notes between participants in the NBB-SSS, Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the
ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although the NBB-SSS, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in the NBB-SSS, Euroclear or
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying
Agent has any responsibility for the performance by the NBB-SSS, Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

303


-----

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes was made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through the NBB-SSS,
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds
in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of NBB-SSS,
Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for
value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear and Clearstream and
will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s
accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Agents**

For so long as the Notes are represented by Global Notes, the Paying Agent will act as paying agent for all
purposes in relation to the Notes. If interests in the Global Notes are exchanged for Definitive Registered
Notes in the limited circumstances described under ‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’ above, then the Paying
Agent will cease to act as paying agent, and the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, make payments on the
Definitive Registered Notes or appoint a paying agent to make payments on the Definitive Registered
Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

304


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes
including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale or
redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein.

**Certain Belgian Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of the principal Belgian tax consequences for investors receiving interest in
respect of, and disposing of, Notes and is of a general nature, for information purposes only and based on
the Issuer’s understanding of current law and practice. This summary is based on the laws, regulations and
applicable tax treaties, all as in effect in Belgium on the date of the Offering Memorandum, and is subject
to any changes in law and the interpretation and application thereof, possibly with retroactive effect. Notes
may be held only by, and transferred only to, Eligible Investors (as defined below) holding their Notes in
an X account (as defined below). This section summarizes the Belgian withholding tax treatment in the
hands of Eligible Investors only.

For the purpose of the summary below, a Belgian resident is, (a) an individual subject to Belgian personal
income tax (i.e. an individual who has his domicile in Belgium or has his seat of wealth in Belgium, or a
person assimilated to a Belgian resident), (b) a legal entity subject to Belgian corporate income tax (i.e. a
company that has its main establishment, its administrative seat or its seat of management in Belgium), or
(c) a legal entity subject to Belgian legal entities tax (i.e. an entity other than a legal entity subject to
corporate income tax having its main establishment, its administrative seat or its seat of management in
Belgium). A non-resident is a person who is not a Belgian resident.

**_Interest_**

For Belgian tax purposes, interest includes (i) periodic interest income, (ii) any amounts paid by the Issuer
in excess of the issue price (upon full or partial redemption, whether or not at maturity, or upon purchase
by the Issuer), and (iii) assuming the Notes qualify as fixed income securities pursuant to Article 2, § 1, 8�
of the Belgian Income Tax Code 1992 (wetboek van de inkomenstenbelastingen 1992/code des impˆots sur les
_revenus 1992, ‘‘BITC’’), in case of a sale of the Notes to any third party, other than the Issuer, the pro rata_
accrued interest corresponding to the detention period.

Payments of interest on the Notes made by or on behalf of a Belgian Issuer are as a rule subject to Belgian
withholding tax, currently at a rate of 30% on the gross amount. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes—Interest payments on the Notes may be subject to Belgian withholding tax’’._

However, as an exception to the aforementioned general rule in relation to Belgian withholding tax,
payments of interest and principal under the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer may be made without
deduction of withholding tax in respect of the Notes if and as long as at the moment of payment or
attribution of interest they are held by certain eligible investors (the ‘‘Eligible Investors’’, see below) in an
exempt securities account (an ‘‘X Account’’) that has been opened with a financial institution that is a
direct or indirect participant (a ‘‘Participant’’) in the NBB-SSS operated by the NBB. Euroclear and
Clearstream are directly or indirectly Participants for this purpose. Holding the Notes through the
NBB-SSS enables Eligible Investors to receive the gross interest income on their Notes and to transfer the
Notes on a gross basis.

Participants to the NBB-SSS must enter the Notes which they hold on behalf of Eligible Investors in an X
Account.

Eligible Investors are those entities referred to in article 4 of the Belgian Royal Decree of May 26, 1994 on
the deduction of withholding tax (koninklijk besluit van 26 mei 1994 over de inhouding en de vergoeding van
_de roerende voorheffing/arrˆet´e royal du 26 mai 1994 relatif `a la perception et `a la bonification du pr´ecompte_
_mobilier) which include:_

(a) Belgian resident companies referred to in article 2, §1, 5�, b) of the BITC;

(b) without prejudice to the application of article 262, 1� and 5� of the BITC, the institutions, associations
or companies referred to in article 2, § 3, of the law of July 9, 1975 on the supervision of insurance
companies, other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b);

305


-----

(c) the semi-public (‘‘parastatal’’) social security agencies, or agencies equivalent thereto, referred to in
article 105, 2�, of the royal decree implementing the BITC (koninklijk besluit tot invoering van het
_wetboek inkomstenbelastingen 1992/arrˆet´e royal d’ex´ecution du code des impˆots sur les revenus 1992, ‘‘RD/_
**BITC’’);**

(d) the non-resident investors referred to in article 105, 5� of the RD/BITC;

(e) the investment funds recognized in the framework of pension savings referred to in article 115 of the
RD/BITC;

(f) the taxpayers referred to in article 227, 2�, of the BITC who are subject to the tax on non-residents in
accordance with article 233 of the BITC and who have used the income producing capital for the
exercise of their professional activity in Belgium;

(g) the Belgian State, for its investments which are exempt from the withholding tax on income from
movable assets, in accordance with article 265 of the BITC;

(h) collective investment undertakings governed by foreign law which are an indivisible estate managed by
a management company on behalf of the participants, provided that the fund units are not publicly
issued in Belgium and are not traded in Belgium; and

(i) Belgian resident companies not referred to under paragraph (a) above, when their activities
exclusively or principally consist of the granting of credits and loans.

The above categories only summarise the detailed definitions contained in Article 4 of the Royal Decree of
26 May 1994, as amended, to which investors should refer for a precise description of the relevant
eligibility rules.

Eligible Investors do not include, _inter alia, Belgian resident investors who are individuals or non-profit_
making organizations, other than those mentioned under paragraphs (b) and (c) above.

Transfers of Notes between two X Accounts (between two due dates) do not give rise to Belgian
withholding tax on accrued incomes.

Upon opening of an X Account for the holding of Notes, the Eligible Investor is required to provide the
Participant with a statement of its eligible status on a form approved by the Minister of Finance. There is
no on-going declaration requirement to the NBB-SSS as to the eligible status, save that they need to
inform the Participant of any change in the information contained in the statement of their eligible status.
However, Participants are requested to make declarations to the NBB as to the eligible status of each
investor from whom they held notes in an X Account during the preceding calendar year.

An X Account may be opened with a Participant by an intermediary (an ‘‘Intermediary’’) in respect of
Notes that the Intermediary holds for the account of its clients (the ‘‘Beneficial Owners’’), provided,
however, that each Beneficial Owner is an Eligible Investor. In such case, the Intermediary must deliver to
the Participant a statement on a form approved by the Minister of Finance confirming that (i) the
Intermediary is itself an Eligible Investor, and (ii) the Beneficial Owners holding their Notes through it are
also Eligible Investors. The Beneficial Owner is also required to deliver a statement of its eligible status to
the Intermediary.

These identification requirements do not apply to central securities depositaries, as defined by Article 2,
§1, 1) of Regulation (EU) n� 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 23, 2014 on
improving securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories and
amending Directives [98]⁄26/EC and 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 236/2012, acting as Participants to
the NBB Clearing System, provided that (i) they only hold X-Accounts, (ii) they are able to identify the
holders for whom they hold Notes in such account and (iii) the contractual rules agreed upon by these
central securities depositaries acting as Participants include the contractual undertaking that their clients
and account owners are all Eligible Investors.

**_Belgian Tax on Income and Capital Gains_**

This section summarizes the Belgian tax on income and capital gains in the hands of Eligible Investors.
This section therefore does not address the tax treatment in the hands of investors that do not qualify as
Eligible Investors such as Belgian resident individuals and Belgian legal entities that do not qualify as
Eligible Investors. This section does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Belgian income
and capital gains tax consequences that may be relevant to a decision to acquire, to hold or to dispose of

306


-----

the Notes. This summary does not describe the tax consequences of investors that are subject to special
rules.

**_Belgian Resident Companies_**

Interest attributed or paid to corporate holders of the Notes who are Belgian residents for tax purposes,
i.e., who are subject to the Belgian Corporate Income Tax (vennootschapsbelasting/impˆot des soci´et´es), as
well as capital gains realized upon the sale of the Notes are taxable at the current general corporate
income tax rate of 25% (with a reduced rate of 20% applying to the first tranche of EUR 100,000 of
taxable income of qualifying small companies). Capital losses realized upon the sale of the Notes are in
principle tax deductible.

Different rules apply to companies subject to a special tax regime, such as investment companies within the
meaning of article 185bis of the BITC.

**_The proposed Belgian tax on securities accounts_**

The Belgian Government has recently announced the introduction of a new tax on securities accounts.
Based on the current pre-drafts of the law (which is still subject to review by the Council of State and is yet
to be proposed in Parliament), the new tax on securities accounts (TSA) intends to levy a tax on securities
accounts held by individuals and/or companies with qualifying intermediaries, but only to the extent the
account has a value exceeding EUR 1,000,000. The definition of securities in scope of this new levy is
rather broad and includes, a.o. notes.

The proposed rate of the TSA amounts to 0.15% on the value of the securities account and will be payable
annually.

The TSA, as currently proposed, envisages the following securities accounts:

- Belgian and foreign securities accounts the beneficial owner of which is a Belgian tax resident
individual or company;

- Belgian securities accounts the beneficial owner of which is a foreign tax resident individual or
company;

- Belgian and foreign securities accounts held by a non-Belgian entity falling in scope of the so-called
Cayman Tax (look-through tax treatment for entities established in low tax jurisdictions the
shareholder or founder of which is a Belgian tax resident individual).

The exact scope and impact of the TSA remains subject to approval of the Council of State and the Belgian
Parliament. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear.
Based on the current draft bill of law, neither the NBB nor Euroclear & Clearstream qualify as ‘‘qualifying
intermediaries’’ for the purpose of the TSA.

**_Belgian Resident Legal Entities_**

Belgian legal entities subject to Belgian legal entities tax (rechtspersonenbelasting/impˆots des personnes
_morales) which qualify as Eligible Investors and which, consequently, have received gross interest income_
are required to declare and pay the 30% withholding tax to the Belgian tax authorities.

Capital gains realized on the sale of the Notes are in principle tax exempt, unless and to the extent the
capital gains (partially) qualify as interest (as defined in the section ‘‘Interest’’ above). Capital losses are in
principle not tax deductible.

**_Belgian Non-Residents_**

Holders of the Notes who are not residents of Belgium for Belgian tax purposes and who are not holding
the Notes through their permanent establishment in Belgium, will not become liable for any Belgian tax on
income or capital gains or any similar taxes for the sole reason of the acquisition, ownership or disposal of
the Notes provided that they qualify as Eligible Investors and that they hold their Notes in an X Account.

**_Tax on Stock Exchange Transactions_**

A stock exchange tax (taks op de beursverrichtingen/taxe sur les op´erations de bourse) will normally be levied
on the purchase and sale and other acquisition or transfer for consideration of the Notes on the secondary

307


-----

market (i.e. not at issuance) if (i) it is executed in Belgium through a professional intermediary, or
(ii) deemed to be executed in Belgium, which is the case if the order is directly or indirectly made to a
professional intermediary established outside of Belgium, either by private individuals with habitual
residence in Belgium, or legal entities for the account of their seat or establishment in Belgium (both, a
‘‘Belgian Investor’’).

The tax on stock exchange transactions is levied at a rate of 0.12% with a maximum amount of A1,300 per
transaction and per party.

The tax is due separately by each party to any such transaction, i.e. the seller (transferor) and the
purchaser (transferee), both collected by the professional intermediary. However, if the intermediary is
established outside of Belgium, the tax will in principle be due by the Belgian Investor, unless that Belgian
Investor can demonstrate that the tax has already been paid. Professional intermediaries established
outside of Belgium can, subject to certain conditions and formalities, appoint a Belgian representative,
who will be liable for the tax on stock exchange transactions in respect of the transactions executed through
the professional intermediary. If the representative would have paid the tax on stock exchange transactions
due, the Belgian Investor will, as per the above, no longer be the debtor of the tax on stock exchange
transactions.

An exemption from this tax is available under Article 126/1, 2� of the Code on Miscellaneous Duties and
Taxes as regards, among others, the following entities when they act for their own account: (i) parties to
securities trades who are intermediaries within the meaning of Article 2, 9� and 10� of the Law of August 2,
2002 on the supervision of the financial sector and financial services; (ii) insurance undertakings within the
meaning of Article 2, § 1 of the Law of July 9, 1975 on supervision of insurance companies; (iii) institutions
for occupational retirement provisions within the meaning of Article 2, 1� of the Law of October 27, 2006
regarding the control of institutions for occupational retirement provisions (instellingen voor
_bedrijfspensioenvoorziening/institutions de retraite professionnelle); (iv) collective investment schemes;_
(v) Belgian regulated real estate companies; and (vi) non-residents certifying their non-resident status.

As stated below, the European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common
Financial Transactions Tax (‘‘FTT’’). The proposal currently stipulates that once the FTT enters into force,
the participating Member States shall not maintain or introduce taxes on financial transactions other than
the FTT (or VAT as provided in the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of November 28, 2006 on the common
system of value added tax). For Belgium, the tax on stock exchange transactions should thus be abolished
once the FTT enters into force. The proposal is still subject to negotiation between the participating
Member States and therefore may be changed at any time.

**_The Proposed FTT_**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the ‘‘Commission’s Proposal’’) for
a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria,
Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (each, other than Estonia, a ‘‘participating Member State’’). However,
Estonia has ceased to participate. The last report of the General Secretariat of the Council dated
December 9, 2019 has indicated that talks are still ongoing between the participating Member States.

The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in
Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of
Notes should, however, be exempt.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within
and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in Notes
where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating
Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, ‘‘established’’ in a participating Member
State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a
participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued
in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It
may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU
Member States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences relevant to U.S.
holders and non-U.S. holders (each as defined below) of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the
Notes. This summary deals only with Notes held as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’)) by holders who purchase the Notes for cash
pursuant to this offering at their ‘‘issue price’’ (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes of
the applicable series is sold for money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar
persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler).

As used herein, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for United States federal
income tax purposes, any of the following:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia;

- an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

- a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a
valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United
States person.

A ‘‘non-U.S. holder’’ is a beneficial owner of the Notes that is neither a U.S. holder nor a partnership.

If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds
Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities
of the partnership. A partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Notes
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of all of the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income or the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws,
or the impact to holders subject to special tax treatment under the United States federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation:

- a dealer in securities or currencies;

- a financial institution;

- a regulated investment company;

- a real estate investment trust;

- a tax-exempt organization;

- an insurance company;

- a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction
or a straddle;

- a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;

- a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

- a partnership or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity);

- U.S. holders whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the U.S. dollar;

- a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes
as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or

- a United States expatriate.

309


-----

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial
decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to
result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have
not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) regarding the matters
discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are different from those
discussed below.

If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the
particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other United States federal tax
laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

**_U.S. Holders_**

**_Payments of Interest_**

Payments of interest on a Note will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as ordinary interest
income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S.
holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the
date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. An accrual basis
U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment in
accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be
based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an
accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year).
Under the second method, the U.S. holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the
basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period or, in the case of an accrual period
that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the
taxable year. Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last
day of the accrual period or taxable year, an electing accrual basis U.S. holder may instead translate the
accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such
election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year
to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and will be irrevocable without the
consent of the IRS.

Under either of these two methods, upon receipt of the interest payment an accrual basis U.S. holder will
recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if
any, between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and
the amount previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A
cash basis U.S. holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest
income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency
received. Interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes to a cash basis or accrual basis U.S. holder will generally
constitute income from sources outside the United States.

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid or deemed paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder
may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of
complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their
tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in
an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the date of sale
or other taxable disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid interest, which will
generally be taxable to the extent not previously included in income as described above under ‘‘Payments of
_Interest’’) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note_
generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price of the Notes on the date of purchase. In the
case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder
and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign
currency by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition or the

310


-----

purchase, as applicable. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election
must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS. An accrual method U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent attributable to the difference between the spot rates on
the trade date and settlement date.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note (except as
discussed with respect to exchange gain or loss) will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the
sale or other taxable disposition. Net long-term capital gain recognized by a non-corporate U.S. holder
generally is eligible for reduced U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject
to significant limitations.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on the sale or other disposition of a Note that is attributable to
changes in exchange rates will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss attributable
to changes in exchange rates with respect to the principal of a Note generally will equal the difference, if
any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note,
determined at the exchange rate in effect on the date the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and (ii) the
U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price for the Note, determined at the exchange rate in
effect on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note (or, as discussed above, in the case of a cash basis
or electing accrual basis U.S. holder, the settlement date of such disposition or purchase, if the Note is
treated as traded on an established securities market). The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal
and with respect to accrued and unpaid interest (which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘Payments
_of Interest’’) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the_
sale or other taxable disposition of the Note.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Subject to the discussion on ‘‘Information Reporting and Backup Withholding’’ below, a non-U.S. holder
generally should not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any payments on the Notes or
gain from the sale, redemption or other disposition of the Notes unless: (i) that payment or gain is
effectively connected with the conduct by that non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the United
States or (ii) in the case of any gain realized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note by an
individual non-U.S. holder, that non-U.S. holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the sale or other taxable disposition and certain other conditions are met.

**_Disclosure Requirements_**

Individuals that own ‘‘specified foreign financial assets’’ with an aggregate value in excess of certain
thresholds are generally required to file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets
with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these
reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Under
certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules.

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS (on IRS Form 8886) of certain foreign currency
transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of
interest on, or the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note or foreign currency received in respect of a
Note.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest on the Notes and to the
proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S.
holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such
exemption. Backup withholding may also apply to such payments if the U.S. holder is not otherwise exempt
and fails to comply with the applicable backup withholding requirements, including the provision of IRS
Form W-9, if required.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the

311


-----

required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining
such an exemption.

Non-U.S. holders may be required to comply with applicable certification procedures (usually on IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) to establish that they are not U.S. holders in order to avoid the application
of such information reporting requirements and backup withholding.

**Certain General Income Tax Considerations**

**_Payments by Guarantors_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions
of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption that may apply. Holders may be eligible
to receive a gross-up from the payor with respect to the amounts withheld, subject to certain exceptions, as
described in ‘‘Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts’’. Holders of Notes should
consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a Guarantor makes any payments with
respect to the Notes.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX
MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH
PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE
INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

312


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

Unless otherwise provided in any supplement to this Offering Memorandum, the Notes should be eligible
for purchase by employee benefit plans and other plans subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), and/or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code
and by governmental, church and non-U.S. plans that are subject to state, local, other federal law of the
United States or non-U.S. law that is substantially similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (‘‘Similar Law’’) subject to consideration of the issues described in this section.
ERISA imposes certain requirements on ‘‘employee benefit plans’’ (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
subject to ERISA, including entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose
underlying assets include the assets of such plans (collectively, ‘‘ERISA Plans’’), and on those persons who
are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general
fiduciary requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the
requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the
ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of
an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and
circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors’’.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of
the Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, the ‘‘Plans’’)) and certain
persons (referred to as ‘‘parties in interest’’ or ‘‘disqualified persons’’) having certain relationships to such
Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or
disqualified person, including a Plan fiduciary, who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the
Paying Agent or any other party to the transactions referred to in this Offering Memorandum may be
parties in interest or disqualified persons with respect to many Plans. Prohibited transactions within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if any of the Notes is acquired or
held by a Plan, including but not limited to where the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent or any other party to such transactions is a
party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the
type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances under which such
decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions between a person that is a party in interest (other
than a fiduciary or an affiliate that has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders investment
advice with respect to assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the plan,
provided that there is adequate consideration for the transaction), Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption
(‘‘PTCE’’) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to
transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions
involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company
pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by in-house asset
managers). Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited transaction
rules and these exceptions. There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other
exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving any Notes.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject
to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Law. Fiduciaries of any
such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, if
necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has promulgated a regulation, 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the ‘‘Plan Asset Regulation’’), describing what constitutes the assets
of a Plan with respect to the Plan’s investment in an entity for purposes of certain provisions of ERISA,
including the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA, and Section 4975 of the Code. Under
the Plan Asset Regulation, if a Plan invests in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a publiclyoffered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the United States

313


-----

Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided
interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless one of the exceptions to such treatment described
in the Plan Asset Regulation applies. Under the Plan Asset Regulation, a security which is in the form of
debt may be considered an equity interest if it has substantial equity features. If the Issuer was deemed
under the Plan Asset Regulation to hold plan assets by reason of a Plan’s investment in any of the Notes,
such plan assets would include an undivided interest in the assets held by the Issuer and transactions by the
Issuer would be subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. The Plan Asset Regulation provides,
however, that if equity participation in any entity by ‘‘Benefit Plan Investors’’ is not significant, then the
‘‘look-through’’ rule will not apply to such entity. The term ‘‘Benefit Plan Investors’’ is defined in the Plan
Asset Regulation to include (1) any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to
Title I of ERISA, (2) any plan described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, and (3) any entity whose
underlying assets include ‘‘plan assets’’ by reason of any such employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment
in the entity. Equity participation by Benefit Plan Investors in any entity is significant if, immediately after
the most recent acquisition of any equity interest in the entity, 25% or more of the total value of any class
of equity interests in the entity (excluding the value of any interests held by certain persons, other than
Benefit Plan Investors, exercising control over the assets of the entity or providing investment advice to the
entity for a fee or any affiliates of such persons) is held by Benefit Plan Investors. If, as a result of any
investment, 25% or more of the total value of any class of equity interests in the Issuer is being held by
Benefit Plan Investors, the applicable Notes may be redeemed by the Issuer. While there is little pertinent
authority in this area and no assurance can be given, the Issuer believes that the Notes should not be
treated as equity interests for the purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation and, therefore, the Plan Asset
Regulation should not apply and any such redemptions would not be necessary.

Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in any supplement to this Offering Memorandum, each
purchaser and subsequent transferee of any Notes will represent and warrant, on each day from the date
on which the purchaser or transferee acquires such Notes (or any interests therein) through and including
the date on which the purchaser or transferee disposes of such Notes (or any interests therein), either that
(a) it is not, and for so long as it holds such Notes (or any interests therein) will not be, and will not be
acting on behalf of, a Plan or any entity whose underlying assets include, or are deemed for purposes of
ERISA or the Code to include, the assets of any Plan or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is
subject to any Similar Law or (b) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes (or any interests
therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan subject to Similar
Law, a violation of any Similar Law).

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of any Notes that is a Benefit Plan Investor will be deemed to
represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or any other party to the transactions referred
to in this Offering Memorandum, or other persons that provide marketing services, or any of their
respective affiliates, has provided, and none of them will provide, any investment recommendation or
investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan
Investor (‘‘Plan Fiduciary’’), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the
Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA
or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the Benefit Plan Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with
the Benefit Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Notes; and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own
independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes.

Each Plan Fiduciary who is responsible for making the investment decisions whether to purchase or
commit to purchase and to hold any of the Notes should determine whether, under the documents and
instruments governing the Plan, an investment in such Notes is appropriate for the Plan, taking into
account the overall investment policy of the Plan and the composition of the Plan’s investment portfolio.
Any Plan proposing to invest in such Notes (including any governmental, church or non-U.S. plan) should
consult with its counsel to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction and will satisfy the other requirements of ERISA and the Code (or, in the case of a
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any Similar Law).

The sale of any Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent or any other party to the
transactions that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by
Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any
particular Plan.

Any further ERISA considerations with respect to the Notes may be found in the relevant supplement.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of
the Notes offered hereby.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act, or any state securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only
to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act) in reliance on
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and persons that are not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act that, in each case, will hold the Notes in an X
Account with the NBB-SSS (either directly or indirectly through a participant in the NBB-SSS (including
Euroclear and Clearstream)).

We have not registered and will not register the Notes or the Note Guarantees under the U.S. Securities
Act and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account
or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Notes to

in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S.

We use the terms ‘‘offshore transaction’’, ‘‘U.S. person’’ and ‘‘United States’’ with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to
and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant
to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance
with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) You are not our ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) or acting on our

(a) a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and are aware that any
sale of these Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act,
and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) a non-U.S. person that is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

(3) You acknowledge that none of us, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing any of them, has made any representation to you with respect to us or the offer or sale of
any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering
Memorandum has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your investment
decision with respect to the Notes. You acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any
person representing the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of this Offering Memorandum. You have had access to such financial and other
information concerning us and the Notes as you have deemed necessary in connection with your
decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request
information from, us and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which

securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property
of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or
their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account or accounts for which you are
purchasing the Rule 144A Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Rule 144A Notes by its
acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the
date (the ‘‘Resale Restriction Termination Date’’) that is one year after the later of the date of the
original issue and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or
any predecessor thereto) only (i) to us, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared
effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible pursuant to
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases
for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made
in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur
outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act or
(v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of
your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their
control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and
regulations, and further subject to our and the trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer
(I) pursuant to clause (v) above to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or
other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a
certificate of transfer in the form appearing in the Indenture is completed and delivered by the
transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale
Restriction Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following
effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘‘U.S. SECURITIES ACT’’), OR THE

-----

(6) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer the Notes notice of any restrictions
on the transfer of such Notes.

(7) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the
Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate
the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act.

(8) You acknowledge that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any
Notes acquired by you except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Registrar that
the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

(9) You represent and agree that either (a) you are not, and for so long as you hold a Note (or any
interest therein) you will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of, (i) an ‘‘employee benefit plan’’ as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) a ‘‘plan’’ as defined in and
subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) an entity whose underlying assets include the assets of any
such employee benefit plan subject to ERISA or other plan subject to Section 4975 of the Code (each
of the foregoing, a ‘‘Benefit Plan Investor’’), or (iv) a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is
subject to any Similar Law, or (b) your acquisition, holding and disposition of the Note (or any
interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or, in the case of such a governmental, church or non-U.S.
plan, a violation of any Similar Law. If you are a Benefit Plan Investor, you will be deemed to
represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or any other party to the transactions
referred to in this Offering Memorandum, or other persons that provide marketing services, or any of
their respective affiliates, has provided, and none of them will provide, any investment
recommendation or investment advice on which you, or any fiduciary or other person investing your
assets (‘‘Plan Fiduciary’’), has relied as a primary basis in connection with your or the Plan Fiduciary’s
decision to invest in the Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined
in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to you or the Plan Fiduciary in
connection with your acquisition of the Notes; and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own
independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes.

(10) You, and any fiduciary causing you to acquire a Note (or any interest therein), agree to indemnify and
hold harmless the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or the Paying Agent and/or their respective affiliates, from and against any cost, damage or
loss incurred by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or the Paying Agent and/or any of their respective affiliates, as applicable, as a result of any
of the foregoing representations and agreements being or becoming false. Any purported acquisition
or transfer of any Note or beneficial interest therein to a purchaser or transferee that does not comply
with the requirements of the above provisions shall be void ab initio.

(11) You acknowledge that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of
your acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by your
purchase of the Notes is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If you are
acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, you represent that you
have sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that you have full
power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each
such investor account.

(12) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by us
or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the
Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the
Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under ‘‘Plan of Distribution’’.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’) dated
the date of this Offering Memorandum by and among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial
Purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to
purchase from us, the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering prices and other selling terms of the Notes may from
time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales in the United States may be made
through certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain
limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is
60 days after the date hereof, we will not, and the Guarantors will not, without the prior written consent
provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt
securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are substantially similar to the
Notes.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act
and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance
on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and outside the United States to persons that are not U.S.
persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in
this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales of
the Notes are restricted as described under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’.

Each Initial Purchaser represents warrants and agrees that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us or the Guarantors; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not
be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the UK. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus
Regulation. No key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering, selling or
distributing any in scope financial instrument or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the
EEA has been prepared. Offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA of the UK may be unlawful.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold, distributed or otherwise
made available and will not offer, sell, distribute or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail
investor in the EEA or the UK. For the purposes of this provision:

(1) the expression ‘‘retail investor’’ means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

319


-----

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation; and

(2) the expression ‘‘offer’’ includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide
to purchase or subscribe to the Notes.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes.
See ‘‘Notice to Investors’’.

We and the Guarantors have also agreed that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale,
pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S.
Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act to cease to
be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We will apply, through our
Listing Agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however, we cannot assure you that
the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it
will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price
which will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes’’.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be five business days (as such term is
used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T + 5’’). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in
the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this
Offering Memorandum or the following two business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who
wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (the ‘‘Stabilizing Manager’’), or persons acting
on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the
open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf,
may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in
the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons
acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the
respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing
Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly,
no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Notes’’._

320


-----

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of
the Offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit
bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified
maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution
has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling
concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased
in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to
be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on
or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if
commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may currently and/or in the
future perform, various financial advisory, investment and corporate banking, commercial lending and
banking, consulting and other commercial services in the ordinary course of business for us and our
affiliates, and may have from time to time in the past held, and may in the future hold, positions in our or
any of our affiliates’ securities or enter into hedging or general derivative transactions with us or our
affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they received or will receive customary fees and
commissions and reimbursement of expenses. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are lenders
under the Senior Facilities.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve our or our affiliates’
securities and/or instruments (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise). The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and at any time may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or any of its affiliates has a lending relationship with us or our affiliates,
such Initial Purchaser or its affiliates may routinely hedge their credit exposure to our or our affiliates in a
manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our or our affiliates’ securities,
including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.

**AVAILABLE INFORMATION**

Each purchaser of the Notes from the Initial Purchasers will be furnished with a copy of this Offering
Memorandum and, to the extent provided to the Initial Purchasers by us for such purpose, any related
amendment or supplement to this Offering Memorandum. Each person receiving this Offering
Memorandum acknowledges that:

(i) such person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us and to review, and has received, all
additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the
information herein;

(ii) such person has not relied on the Initial Purchasers or any person affiliated with the Initial Purchasers
in connection with its investigation of the accuracy of such information or its investment decision; and

(iii) except as provided pursuant to (i) above, no person has been authorized to give any information or to
make any representation concerning the Notes or the Note Guarantees offered hereby other than
those contained herein and, if given or made, such other information or representation should not be
relied upon as having been authorized by us or the Initial Purchasers.

For so long as the Notes remain outstanding and are ‘‘restricted securities’’ within the meaning of
Rule 144(a)(3) under the U.S. Securities Act, we will, during any period in which we are neither subject to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of
the U.S. Exchange Act, upon written request of a holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, furnish to such
holder or beneficial owner or to the Trustee or any relevant paying agent for delivery to such holder or
beneficial owner or prospective purchaser of the Notes, as the case may be, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act, to permit compliance with
Rule 144A thereunder in connection with resales of the Notes. Any such request should be directed to the
Issuer at its registered address (House of HR NV, Beversesteenweg 576, 8800 Roeselare). Copies of the
Indenture, the forms of the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Paying Agency Agreement will be
made available upon request to the Issuer at the address above.

We are not currently, and we will not be, subject to the periodic reporting and other information
requirements of the U.S. Exchange Act. Pursuant to the Indenture and so long as the Notes are
outstanding, we will furnish periodic information to holders of the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Reports’’._

324


-----

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap/soci´et´e anonyme) organized under
the laws of Belgium and the Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of Belgium,
Germany and the Netherlands. All of the Issuer’s directors and executive officers and the directors and
executive officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and all of the assets of the
Issuer and the Guarantors and of those persons are located outside the United States. Although the Issuer
will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New
York courts, in each case, in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may not be able to
effect service of process on such persons or the Issuer or the Guarantors within the United States in any
action, including actions predicated on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal and state securities laws
or other laws. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United
States upon the Issuer, the Guarantor or such persons, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S.
courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. In addition,
we cannot assure you that civil liabilities predicated upon the Federal securities laws of the United States
will be enforceable in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands or elsewhere.

Additionally, because the Senior Facilities and the Intercreditor Agreement are governed by the law of
England and Wales, it is likely that a claim arising therefrom will be brought in an English court, following
which enforcement of any judgment rendered against the Issuer or a Guarantor would need to be sought in
an English court.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee agree that any dispute,
controversy or cause of action against the Issuer, the Guarantors and/or the Trustee arising out of the
Indenture or any transaction contemplated therein, the Notes or other deposited securities, will be
referred to and resolved by the courts of New York, as more fully described in the Indenture.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, the Guarantors or any directors or officers,
investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even
though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for
Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent
jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Belgium**

Final and enforceable judgments rendered by foreign courts can be declared enforceable in Belgium
(without review of the foreign judgment on the merits by the Belgian courts) according to the procedure
set out in Articles 22 and sq. of the Belgian Code of International Private Law (Wetboek van Internationaal
_Privaatrecht/ Code de Droit International Priv´e) and provided that, pursuant to Article 24 of the same Code,_
the following documents are produced in court by the claimant:

- an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/exp´edition de la d´ecision) fulfilling all
conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

- if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the
originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law;

- any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and
has been notified to the defendant.

However, enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of
International Private Law and notably (and, _inter alia), if:_

- the rights of defense have been violated;

- such enforcement would be incompatible with Belgian public policy;

- the decision may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement
could then be granted); or

- Belgian jurisdictions had exclusive jurisdictions in respect of that matter.

**Germany**

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state
securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or

325


-----

state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A
final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an
action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German
Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The
recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number
of factors, including the following:

- the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law;

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;

- the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a
timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of non-compliance with such
requirement, (i) the defendant does not invoke such non-compliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared
in the proceedings;

- the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became _res judicata rendered by a German_
court or (ii) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized
in Germany and the procedure leading to the applicable judgment does not contradict any such
judgment under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

- the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the fundamental principles
of German law, in particular with the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German
Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that
attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful.

In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure
exists under German law. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights
generally.

In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German
courts as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may
reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they
are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With
respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other
jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the
proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the
deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any
proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final U.S. judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States.
Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a
German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German
court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment
rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**The Netherlands**

Some Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. As a result, it may be difficult for
investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Dutch Guarantor. The
Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore,

a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the
United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws,
would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment
which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court. A
final judgment by a U.S. court, however, may under current practice be given binding effect, if and to the
extent that the Dutch court finds that (i) the jurisdiction of the U.S. court has been based on grounds that
are internationally acceptable, (ii) the judgment by the U.S. court was rendered in legal proceedings that
comply with the standards of the proper administration of justice that includes sufficient safeguards
(behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) the judgment by the U.S. court is not incompatible with a decision rendered
between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with a previous decision rendered between the same parties
by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided
that the previous decision qualifies for acknowledgement in the Netherlands and (iv) the final judgment
does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties,
investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained
from U.S. federal or state courts. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by
a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses
or damages.

Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in the Netherlands are governed by the
provisions of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).

To the Board of Directors

**Statutory auditor’s report on review of condensed consolidated financial information for the nine months**
**ended 30 September 2020**

_Introduction_

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim balance sheet of House of HR NV
(the ‘‘Company’’) as at 30 September 2020 and the related condensed consolidated interim income
statement for the nine months then ended, condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive
income, condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity and condensed consolidated
interim statement of cash flows for the nine months period then ended (the ‘‘Interim Financial
Information’’), as well as the explanatory notes. The board of directors is responsible for the preparation
and presentation of the Interim Financial Information in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial
reporting as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this
condensed consolidated financial information based on our review.

_Scope of Review_

We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements 2410
‘‘Review of interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity’’ (ISRE
2410). A review on interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. As
such our review does not provide the assurance that we will identify all significant matters that we might
have discovered during an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

_Conclusion_

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
consolidated condensed financial information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
IAS 34, as adopted by the European Union.

The goodwill as a result of these acquisitions is attributable to the workforce and the expected high
profitability of the acquired business. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

_Accounting policy choice for non-controlling interests_

IFRS allows the Group to recognize the non-controlling interests in an acquired entity either at fair value
or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. This
decision is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.

Group Management decided to recognize all the non-controlling interests at fair value.

_Acquired receivables_

The following table summarizes the fair value of acquired trade receivables as per acquisition date:

**Acquired receivables** **TechMatch** **BookU**

Contractual amount of trade receivables due . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.560.389 59.943
Amount of uncollectible trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0

**Fair value of acquired trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1.560.389** **59.943**

The gross amount of the acquired trade receivables approximates its fair value.

Revenue and profit contribution

The acquired business contributed since its acquisition dates the following amount of revenue and net
profit to the Group:

**Contribution to revenue and net profit since the date of the acquisition:** **TechMatch** **BookU**

Revenue: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.832.262 44.297

If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January of the year, consolidated pro-forma revenue and net profit
for the 9 months ended 2020 would have been:

**Contribution to revenue and net profit as if the acquisition was completed per 1 January:** **TechMatch** **BookU**

Revenue: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.832.262 282.057

These amounts have been calculated using the subsidiary’s results, adjusting them for:

  - differences in the accounting policies between the Group and the subsidiary, and

  - the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair
value adjustments to intangible assets had applied from 1 January of every year, together with the
consequential tax effects.

Contingent assets and contingent liabilities

The Group did not recognize any material contingent asset or contingent liabilities under the purchase
price allocation exercise.

Besides above-mentioned impact on the net cash flow from investing activities, payments of earn-outs
accrued as per December 31, 2019 and amounts paid to minority shareholders (cf. note 3.3) are included in
the line item ‘Acquisitions of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired’ in the cash flow statement.

Acquisition related costs

The total acquisition-related costs related to these acquisitions amount to EUR 0,13 million. All these
costs have been expensed within the statement of financial performance at the transaction date.

**3.1.2 Acquisitions in the prior year**

During the first nine months of 2019 the Group acquired control over:

i. The Pharmacos Group (2 April 2019), a group specialized in the pharma and bio-engineering
industry.

ii. The Mykelson Group (3 April 2019), a group active in the project consulting business.

**3.2 Acquisitions of joint ventures and associates**

As per 8 March 2019, the Group acquired 20% of the shares of the company Happy Recruiter SA, a
company incorporated and existing under the laws of Romania. The consideration paid for the acquisition
of 20% of the shares amounts to EUR 700 thousand.

As per 3 April 2020 the Group acquired an additional stake of 15% in the Happy Recruiter SA for a
consideration of EUR 328 thousand.

**3.3 Acquisition of non-controlling interest**

In 2020 the following shares have been acquired which were previously owned by non-controlling interests:

i. As per January 11, 2020 Newco Abylsen acquired 100.000 shares in PI Holding (5,0% or the
ordinary shares) for a price of EUR 0,09 million;

ii. As per January 27, 2020 Newco Abylsen acquired 100.000 shares in Newco Pharmacos (2,6% of
the shares) for a price of EUR 0,10 million;

iii. As per July 31, 2020 Covebo Group BV acquired 1.300 shares in Covebo VNOM BV via a
contribution in kind (EUR 7,37 million);

iv. As per September 22, 2020 Newco Abylsen acquired 13.300 shares in 6BO (44,3% of the shares)
for a price of EUR 0,03 million;

v. As per September 30, 2020 Newco Abylsen acquired 125.000 shares in Newco Belgatech (12,5%
of the shares) and 306.250 profit certificates for a price of EUR 1,06 million;

vi. As per September 30, 2020 Vialegis Europe NV acquired 700 shares in Iterlegis Staffing
Solutions for a price of EUR 0,06 million.

Changes in the non-controlling interests in the Group’s ownership interest after control is obtained, that
do not result in a change in control of the subsidiary, have been accounted for within equity. Therefore, no
gain or loss in the income statement on selling the subsidiary’s shares has been recognized, neither any
additional goodwill has been reflected when acquiring additional shares. Instead, the carrying amount of
the non-controlling interest has been adjusted to reflect the change in the ownership interest in the
subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the
fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in equity and attributed to the Group’s equity
holders.

**3.4 Discontinued operations**

As per June 23, 2020, a share and receivable transfer agreement has been signed resulting in the sale of
GRITT Projects NV. The Group, via its subsidiaries GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV held 100% of the
shares in GRITT Projects NV. This transfer was desirable for GRITT and Logi-Technic, and the House of
HR group in general, as the business model of GRITT Projects was not aligned with the group strategy and
was not delivering the expected group performance. The client base was excessively narrow, implying
strong purchasing power from the customers, which resulted in lower margins than foreseen. This resulting
in a deteriorated financial situation of GRITT Projects. Furthermore, all parties are convinced that the
new shareholders are in a better position to make GRITT Projects profitable again in the coming years.

Following transactions have occurred with regard to the sale of GRITT Projects NV:

1. Capital increase done by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV of EUR 3,24 million.

2. Sale of the shares held by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV, against EUR 1 closing price.

As a result of above transaction, a total loss of EUR 19,92 million has been recorded:

**Fair value estimation**

The majority of financial assets and liabilities are classified as assets/liabilities at amortized cost, except for
derivatives which are measured at the fair value through profit or loss. Borrowings are recognized initially
at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently carried at amortized cost, for which any
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the
income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The Group does
not hold material financial instruments at fair value.

The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to
approximate their fair values.

The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future
contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial
instruments. For most of the borrowings, the fair values are not materially different to their carrying
amounts since the interest payable on those borrowings is either close to current market rates or the
borrowings are of a short-term nature. The difference in the above table for the bank loans is due to paid
transactions costs and the derivative financial asset that are reflected in the net book value, under the
amortized cost method.

**consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2020**

**Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial**
**statements for the three months ended 30 September 2020 (Continued)**

**5 Management judgements and estimates**

Preparing interim financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires management to make judgements
and estimates and to use assumptions that may significantly influence the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the notes on contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. We refer to our annual report 2019.

The current Covid-19 pandemic has several implications on the consolidated figures of the Group. The full
impact on the consolidated figures of the Group is however still unclear and difficult to assess. Prudence
has been considered when preparing the Q3 financial statements. Judgements and estimates have been
required to prepare the financial statements which are prepared based on the best estimate of
management. Assumptions have been used to estimate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the
consolidated figures. Refer to the following notes for more information.

**6 Seasonality**

The Group’s revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations in many of the markets where they operate. The
Group has in the past experienced and expects in the future to experience fluctuations in the results of
operations due to seasonal demand in their current markets. Seasonality means that the Group’s results
vary from quarter to quarter, and therefore the results of one quarter may not be indicative of results for
the full year. Seasonality varies depending on a number of different factors, including the business units,
the operating segments, the underlying industry sector served, including delays in the construction industry
due to weather or otherwise, the nature of any seasonal work during a specific period, such as the weeks
before Christmas and Easter, as well as around harvest time in the food production sector or around
holiday periods, including Christmas and summer holidays. Historically, revenue fluctuates, with higher
levels of revenue typically being received in the second half of the year just after summer holidays with an
additional decrease in December due to Christmas holidays. Due to this seasonality effect, the Group does
not expect their Interim Consolidated Financial Statements to be reflective of the results they anticipate
for the year ended December 31, 2020. Furthermore, the (quarterly) results of the Group are also
impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, impacting the seasonality pattern compared to previous years.

**7 Segment reporting**

For management purposes the Group is organized in three operating segments based on the activity of the
Group. Management assesses segment performance based on the type of activity. HOHR is a leading HR
service provider deriving its revenues and profits from the following three specific types of staffing:

- **General staffing: General temporary agencies delivering candidates to clients in a fast and flexible way,**
whenever they are shorthanded.

- **Specialized staffing: Specialized staffing companies in certain sectors including construction, retail,**
finance and many other sectors

- **Engineering & consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving sectors**
like energy, pharmaceuticals, technology etc. The Group also assists clients with the search and
selection of the right candidate, interim management or secondment.

Corporate management is responsible for managing performance, underlying risks, and effectiveness of
operations.

The table below shows the segment information provided to the strategic steering committee for the
reportable segments for the first nine months ended 30 September 2020 and 30 September 2019 and the
basis on which revenue is recognized.

Segment assets and segment sales are presented before elimination of intersegment transactions. Sales
between segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

There are no differences in the basis of the segmentation or in the basis of the measurement of segment
profit and loss since the year-end 2019 financial statements.

**8 Intangible assets**

Intangible assets decreased by EUR 12,86 million during the first nine months of the accounting period.
This fluctuation results mainly from the depreciation charges recorded on the brand names and customer
relationships (EUR 16,35 million), partially compensated by the acquisition of Techmatch for which brand
name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 0,19 million and EUR 3,66 million, respectively.

Besides the current Covid-19 pandemic discussed in note 9, no additional impairment risks have been
identified.

**Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial**
**statements for the three months ended 30 September 2020 (Continued)**

**9 Goodwill**

Goodwill has decreased by EUR 5,87 million and is highly impacted by the acquisition of Techmatch and
Book’U, for which a goodwill of EUR 7,55 million and EUR 0,51 million has been recorded respectively,
and the disposal of GRITT Projects for which a goodwill of EUR 13,92 million has been derecognized.

The current Covid- 19 pandemic has been considered as a trigger for possible impairment of goodwill and
(in)tangible assets and therefore the Group has tested whether these has suffered any impairment. The
recoverable amount of the CGU’s has been determined based on the value-in-use calculations which
require the use of assumptions. The impairment test was performed on Q3-figures taken into account
below assumptions.

The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management. A
conservative approach has been taken with regard to the assumptions considered in the impairment
analysis, to consider the impact of the Covid19 pandemic. Cash flows beyond the projection period are
extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.

The calculation of value in use for all CGU’s are based on the following assumptions:

**Goodwill allocated** **Pre-tax discount** **Headroom**
**CGU** **(mio EUR)** **rate** **EBITDA margin** **Growth rate** **(mio EUR)**

General Staffing . . . . . . . . . . 80,06 15,5% 7% 2% 21,54
Specialized Staffing . . . . . . . . 326,18 13,3% 9% 2% 217,55
Engineering & Consulting . . . 455,23 13,6% 15% 2% 118,89

With regard to the assessment of value in use of the three CGU’s, being Specialized Staffing, Consulting
and Engineering and General Staffing, Group’s management believes that no reasonably possible change
in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its
recoverable amount.

The CGU’s Specialized Staffing and Consulting and Engineering are strong markets for which nor a 0%
sales increase nor a decrease in EBITDA margin of 2BP, nor an increase in WACC up to 2BP impacts the
carrying amount of the goodwill and (in)tangible assets.

The CGU General Staffing is under pressure as a result of the AUG-reform in 2018, impacting the
performance of the business in Germany. Sensitivity analysis has shown sufficient headroom in calculating
the carrying value of this CGU, as a 0% sales growth in the perpetuity or an increase in WACC of 0,5BP
does not result in an impairment risk. EBITDA margin for General Staffing however should be maintained
as an EBITDA drop above 0,5BP might result in an impairment risk.

**10 Property, Plant and Equipment**

Property, plant & equipment decreased by EUR 0,73 million during the first nine months of the
accounting period. Movement in property, plant & equipment relate mainly to replacement of office
furniture and company cars.

Besides the current Covid-19 pandemic discussed in note 9, no additional impairment risks have been
identified.

**11 Financial instruments by category**

The financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at 30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019 are
classified as financial asset/liability at amortized cost. The Group does not hold any financial assets at fair
value through OCI or financial assets/liabilities at fair value through P&L.

**12 Other non-current assets**

Other non-current assets increased by EUR 3,51 million. The increase is relating to the disposal of GRITT
Projects, for which a loan of EUR 6,00 million has been granted to the buyers of which EUR 0,04 million
has been repaid during 2020, EUR 3,66 million is recorded as non-current assets and EUR 2,00 million is
recorded as other receivable. The remaining balance of the other non-current assets relate mainly to
warranties.

**13 Derivative financial instruments**

A derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to an embedded derivative—the right for the
issuer to exercise an early payment option. As this option is not considered to be closely related to the host
contract, a derivative asset has been recognized and has been measured at the fair value on initial
recognition with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. The value of the
option is calculated by comparing the present value of the cash flows, assuming no prepayment takes
places, discounted by the interest rate including an option adjusted spread, minus the market value of the
bond. At year-end 2019 the value of the derivative financial asset amounts to EUR 7,57 million. The fair
value as per 30 September 2020 is valued at EUR 0,00 million. The difference in fair value has been
recorded via P&L, as finance expense.

**14 Trade and other receivables**

Trade receivables decreased by EUR 34,85 million, mainly influenced by decreased sales in 2020 due to the
Covid-19 pandemic and the disposal of GRITT Projects NV (EUR �4,44 million).

Forward-looking information has been considered in assessing the Expected Credit Loss impairment under
IFRS9, taken into consideration the possible downside resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. This did not
result is a significant impact on the ECL model assumptions.

The group has implemented a commercial finance agreement (factoring) during April 2020 in TimePartner
and Zaquensis. As per September 30, 2020 total trade receivables derecognized relating to the factoring in
Germany amounts to EUR 15,35 million.

Other receivables decreased by EUR 7,88 million and are highly impacted by the disposal of GRITT
Projects resulting in a derecognition of the costs to fulfil the contract (EUR �12,83 million), partially
compensated by the grants receivable relating to the Covid-19 measure in Germany.

**15 Income tax**

Income tax expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of the weighted average effective
annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year.

The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2020 is 95,7%, compared to 53,6% for the nine months
ended 30 September 2019. The average annual tax rate in 2020 is highly impacted by the losses of House of
HR (EUR 20,26 million as per September 30, 2020 compared to EUR 11,42 million as per September 30,
2019).

The decrease in the deferred tax liabilities (EUR �5,39 million) is in line with the depreciation and
amortization recorded on the customer relationships and brand names and the refinancing fees.

**16 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 48,27 million. Refer to the consolidated cash flow statement.

**17 Equity**

The authorized share capital and share premium of the Group as per 30 September 2020 amounts to EUR
238,60 million and is composed of 487.597.749 shares.

losses carried forward at the level of House of HR stand-alone were contributed in the share
premium (EUR �33,55 million) and legal reserves (EUR �1,00 million), followed by a capital
decrease of EUR �12,19 million capital and EUR �25,74 million share premium, of which

2020 and does not expect any loan default or breach at year-end 2020.

**19 Provisions for other liabilities and charges**

Provisions have remained stable as per 30 September 2020 compared to 31 December 2019. These relate
for a main part to the provision for decommissioning.

**20 Employee benefit obligations**

Employee benefit obligations increased by EUR 21,44 million. This is mainly relating to timing as not all
salaries have been paid before September 30, 2020.

**21 Share-based payments**

No changes to the share-based payment plan have occurred during the first nine months of 2020.

**22 Trade payables and other payables**

Trade payables and other payables have decreased by EUR 11,16 million, which is mainly due to the
disposal of GRITT Projects for which a trade payables balance of EUR 6,31 million was recorded per
31 December 2019, and the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in decreased expenditures.

**23 Other liabilities**

Other liabilities have increased by EUR 47,43 million which is mainly impacted by:

- the leaver event for which a debt of EUR 37,93 million is outstanding (see note 17);

- an increase in the VAT payable EUR 9,12 million;

- the accrual for the reimbursement of the governmental grant received by Continu and Covebo
resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. As it is more likely than not that the criteria for obtaining this
grant will not be met, a payable has been recorded for the amount received (EUR 9,00 million);

- partially offset by the interest payments done by House of Finance (EUR �9,43 million).

**24 Revenues**

Revenue of the Group consists of the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the services
rendered during the year to third parties. The Group mainly derives revenue from the transfer of services
over time and at a point in time in the following geographical regions and lines of services:

The group has no customers that represent more than 10% of the overall turnover.

Although the Covid-19 pandemic started during the first quarter of 2020, the effect of the pandemic is
mainly visible as from the second quarter of the year, as governments have taken very strict measures to
prevent the epidemy to spread further as from mid-March 2020. These measures include social distancing,
country wide quarantines, closing of non-essential business, and many alike. Consequently, since
mid-March 2020 the world economy has come to a stop and also the company’s key markets, resulting in a

slow-down of the Group’s activity. Governments have approved very strong support measures for
businesses and individuals, mainly focused in helping to adapt the workforce to the new reality and
providing liquidity to companies (by providing direct financing, guarantees to be used in front of financial
institutions and delaying the payment of certain taxes). During the third quarter of 2020, economy was
slowly picking up. Unfortunately this has slowed down again in the last quarter of 2020 as Covid-19
measures were increasing again. The economic consequences of the decisions required to stop the spread
of the virus heavily impact 2020 performance of the Group. Although the Group has considered the
Covid-19 pandemic in preparing the Q3 financial statements, judgement is required in doing so. As a
result, the final outcome of the pandemic is not predictable, as the dept, duration, and recovery are as of
today impossible to predict.

**25 Other gains and losses**

Other gains and losses of EUR 2,49 million mainly relate the re-estimation of the earn-out payable to the
previous shareholders of TechMatch of EUR 1,08 million.

**26 Cost of Services, Selling expenses, Other general and administrative expenses**

Expenses have decreased compared to the first nine months of last year. The decrease is in line with the
decreased business resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. As a percentage of sales however expenses are
slightly higher compared to the first nine months of last year: cost of services at 74,47% of sales in the
current year compared to 74,32% in 2019, selling expenses at 13,56% in the current year compared to
11,96% in 2019, and other general and administrative expenses at 7,30% in the current year compared to
6,68% in 2019. Although business is declining, expenses are not able to decrease fully in line with the
decreased sales as several expenses are fixed and less dependent on the business fluctuation.

**27 Depreciation, amortization and impairment of PP&E and Intangible assets**

Depreciation and amortization expenses have slightly increased in the first nine months of the current year
(EUR 54,97 million) compared to the first nine months of the previous year (EUR 49,50 million), mainly
relating to increased lease depreciations.

**28 Finance result**

Finance income mainly includes interest income on short-term bank deposits.

Finance expenses mainly include the interest on borrowings from banks, the amortization of the
refinancing costs, and the fair value adjustment on the embedded derivative (note 13).

**29 Contingencies**

There are no material changes in the contingent liabilities and contingent assets since the latest published
financial statements as per 31 December 2019.

**30 Commitments**

The Group has a commitment towards former managers having shares in the Group for the buy-out of
their shares. With regard to 2020 leavers, the total estimated commitment amounts to EUR 20,00 million.

The Group does not have material commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as per
30 September 2020.

During the first nine months of 2020, a new CFO has been appointed at Vialegis. Furthermore, a new CEO
and CFO have been appointed in Abylsen and a new CEO has been appointed in Accent.

For changes in business combinations, refer to note 3.

**32 Events after the reporting date**

The Covid-19 pandemic is still considered as an uncertain factor for which the dept and duration of the
pandemic and the impact on the financial results of the Group are difficult to predict.

As per October 23, 2020 the main part of the leaver event debt (note 17) has been paid
(EUR 37,58 million).

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1 General information**

House of HR NV (‘‘HOHR’’ or ‘‘The Group’’)—formally known as The House of His Royal majesty the
customer II NV—is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Belgium. The registered
office of the entity is Beversesteenweg 576, 8800 Roeselare.

HOHR, together with its subsidiaries, has its roots in the Belgian Accent Group, founded in 1995 by
Ms. Conny Vandendriessche and Mr. Philip Cracco. Naxicap Partners Limited made its initial investment
in 2012 and became the majority shareholder in 2014 following the acquisition of Mr. Philip Cracco’s
shares.

HOHR is a leading HR service provider focusing on three specific types of staffing:

  - **General staffing: General temporary agencies delivering candidates to clients in a fast and flexible**
way, whenever they are shorthanded.

  - **Specialized staffing: Specialized staffing companies in certain sectors including construction,**
retail, finance and many other sectors.

  - **Engineering & consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving**
sectors like energy, pharmaceuticals, technology etc. The Group also assists clients with the
search and selection of the right candidate, interim management or secondment.

The external growth strategy as developed by management of HOHR resulted in a number of important
acquisitions that were successfully completed by the Group over the last years (Refer to the Note 3 for
more information). These acquisitions increased the Group’s foothold in its core sector of delivering
general staffing on a temporary basis to customers as well as in companies active in niche sectors such as
legal and financial services delivering highly ranged professionals to customers. Clients are both SMEs and
large corporations, occupying leading positions in all kinds of industries.

The consolidated financial statements of HOHR include the Company and its subsidiaries (all together
‘‘the Group’’).

The Group currently has a network of over 500 offices in Europe, and is active in Belgium, Germany, the
Netherlands, France and Switzerland, but also present in Spain, Portugal, Romania, Luxembourg and
Poland.

It now employs almost 2.900 people and is providing jobs to 45.000 people each day via its brands:

  - **General staffing: TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS;**

  - **Specialized staffing: Accent, Covebo**

  - **Engineering & consulting: Abylsen, Continu, Redmore, TEC, Vialegis, AERO, IBB and Mach.**

All recent acquisitions substantially contribute to the overall performance of the Group.

The Group structure as in place as per 31 December 2019 is filed in Note 3.

All subsidiaries held directly or indirectly by the Group maintain their accounting records and prepare
statutory financial statements in accordance with local accounting regulations.

The financial statements are issued for authorization to the Annual Shareholders Meeting that will be held
on 20 May 2020. The Board of Directors approved the financial statements per 24 April, 2020.

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies**

This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these
consolidated financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented,
unless otherwise stated.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**2.1 Basis of preparation**

**_(i) Compliance with IFRS_**

These audited consolidated non-statutory financial statements are comprised of the consolidated
statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of financial performance, the consolidated
statement of other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the
consolidated statement of cash flows for the period ended 31 December 2019 and the related notes.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
and adopted within the European Union.

**_(ii) Historical cost convention_**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the
following:

  - Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition
date.

  - Derivative financial instruments, debt and equity financial assets and contingent consideration
that have been measured at fair value;

  - Cash-settled option plans for which the liability is measured at fair value;

  - Other long-term employee benefits, for which the liability is measured in accordance with the
projected unit-credit method.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in
Note 5.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro (EUR) and all values are presented in EUR,
except when otherwise indicated.

**2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**

**_(i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group_**

Below an overview is filed of the impact on the Group of IFRS standards that became applicable for the
first time as from 1 January 2019. The nature and effect of adopting these new accounting standards is
described below.

**_IFRS16 Leases_**

IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease,
SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the
Legal Form of a Lease. The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for most leases under a single
on-balance sheet model.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

a. Nature of the effect of adoption of IFRS 16

  - _Leases where the Group is acting as a lessee under contracts that were previously classified as_
_operating lease contracts_

The Group’s main leased items consist of company cars, regional headquarters, branches and
parking places as well as housing accommodation for some of its temporary staff. The Group also
leases printing and IT equipment which are classified as low value assets and thus exempted.

The Group adopted IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, in accordance with the transitional provisions of
IFRS 16, using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, the Group has chosen to
measure the right-of-use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of
any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to these leases recognized in the balance sheet
immediately before the date of initial application. Consequently, the cumulative effect of
adopting IFRS 16 was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as
at 1 January 2019.

These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments and
discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019. The incremental
borrowing rates applied to the lease liabilities on 1 January 2019 are as follow:

**EUR %, at 1/1/2019** **<5 years** **5–10 years** **>10 years**

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,50% 2,40% 2,60%
Cars . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,30% N/A N/A

The Group has applied the following practical expedients, as permitted by IFRS 16, on the
transition date:

     - Reliance on the previous definition of a lease (as provided by IAS 17) for all contracts
that existed on the date of initial application;

     - The use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar
characteristics;

     - Reliance on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous instead of performing
an impairment review;

     - The accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months
as at short-term leases

  - _Leases where the group is acting as a sublessor_

The Group also acts as a sublessor of housing accommodation. These contracts however are
exempted for qualification as a finance lease under IFRS 16 considering that these relate to
short-term contracts (< 12 months).

Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from IAS 17. Lessors will continue
to classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in IAS 17.
Therefore, IFRS 16 did not have an impact for leases where the Group is the lessor.

  - _Other lease contracts_

The remaining Group’s activities as a lessor are not material and hence the Group did not
identify any significant impact on the financial statements.

b. Impact of IFRS 16 on the Groups’ financial statements as per 31 December 2018 and 31 December
2019

The effect of adoption IFRS 16 is as follows:

- _Impact on the consolidated balance sheet as per 31 December 2019 and 1 January 2019:_

Per 31 December 2018 a total of EUR 6,85 million was accounted for as finance lease under the old IFRS
standard IAS17. The contracts that are classified as a finance lease under the new IFRS standard, IFRS16,
account for a total debt and right-of-use asset of EUR 68,56 million, adding up to a total opening balance
sheet as per 1 January 2019 of EUR 75,40 million.

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

c. Change in accounting policies with effect from 1 January 2019 as a result of the adoption of
IFRS16

The right-of-use assets are presented as part of the Property, Plant and Equipment. Lease
liabilities are presented as part of the other non-current and current liabilities. Both the
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities also include the leases recorded under IAS17.

  - _Right-of-use assets_

The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date
the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial
direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any
lease incentives received.

Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the
lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to
impairment.

  - _Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed
payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable
lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under
residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase
option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating
a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease
payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period on
which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing
rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily
determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect
the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying
amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a
change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the
underlying asset.

  - _Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of
machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the
commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value
assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value
(i.e., below EUR 5 thousand). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**_IFRIC 23 Uncertain Tax Positions_**

This IFRIC clarifies how the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’, are
applied where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The IFRS IC had clarified previously that
IAS 12, not IAS 37 ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’, applies to accounting for

F-46


-----

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

uncertain income tax treatments. IFRIC 23 explains how to recognize and measure deferred and current
income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment.

An uncertain tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over
whether that treatment will be accepted by the tax authority. For example, a decision to claim a deduction
for a specific expense or not to include a specific item of income in a tax return is an uncertain tax
treatment if its acceptability is uncertain under tax law. IFRIC 23 applies to all aspects of income tax
accounting where there is an uncertainty regarding the treatment of an item, including taxable profit or
loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates.

The Group applies IFRS 23 Uncertain Tax Positions and records an accrual if needed.

**_Other new standards, amendments and interpretations:_**

Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2019, but do not have an impact
on the consolidated financial statements of the Group:

- Amendments to IFRS 9, ‘Prepayment features with negative compensation’

- Amendments to IAS 28, ‘Long term interests in associates and joint ventures’

- Amendments to IAS 19, ‘Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement’

- Amendments to IAS 23, ‘Borrowing Costs’

- Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 cycle

The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but
are not yet effective.

**_(ii) New and amended standards not yet adopted by the Group_**

Group’s management preliminary assessment revealed that the following standards and amendments to
standards that have been endorsed within the European Union and that are not yet applicable as per the
first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2019 should not have a material impact for the Group:

- Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective 1 January
2020)

- Amendments to the definition of material in IAS 1 and IAS 8 (effective 1 January 2020).

- Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (effective 1 January
2020).

Standards and amendments to standards that have not yet been endorsed within the European Union and
that are not yet applicable as per the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2019:

- Amendments to the guidance of IFRS 3 Business Combinations

- IFRS 17 ‘Insurance contracts’ (effective 1 January 2022).

**2.3 Principles of consolidation and equity accounting**

**_(i) Subsidiaries_**

The consolidated non-statutory financial information includes the financial statements of entities over
which the Group exercises control. The Group controls an entity (including structured entities) when the
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity to decide over relevant activities. The
existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered
when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the

F-47

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that
control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. Refer to Note 3.1 for
more information.

Inter-company transactions, balances, income and unrealized gains on transactions between Group
companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated
statement of financial position, statement of financial performance and statement of other comprehensive
income as well as the statement of changes in equity.

**_(ii) Joint arrangements_**

A joint arrangement operates in the same way as other entities, except that a contractual arrangement
between the Group and other ventures establishes joint control over the economic activity of the entity.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when
decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Under
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or
joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather
than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.

Joint operations

The Group recognizes its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations
and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been
incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings. The Group does not have any
joint operation as per 31 December 2019.

Joint ventures

Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see below), after initially being
recognized at cost in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group has no joint ventures as
per 31 December 2019.

Equity method

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and adjusted
thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit
or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other
comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognized
as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the
entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses,
unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.

Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to
the extent of the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity
accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by
the Group.

The Group’s investment in joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition.

F-48

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the
policy described in Note 2.11.

**_(iii) Changes in ownership interests_**

The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as
transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment
between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative
interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling
interests and any consideration paid or received is recognized in a separate reserve within equity
attributable to owners of the Group.

When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control,
joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with
the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying
amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture
or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in
respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or
liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are
reclassified to profit or loss.

If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

**2.4 Foreign currency translation**

**_(i) Functional and presentation currency_**

Items included in the financial statements of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated
non-statutory financial statements are presented in euro (EUR), which is the Group’s functional and
presentation currency.

**_(ii) Transactions and balances_**

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement
of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies, are recognized in the income statement, except when deferred in other
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. They are deferred in equity if they relate to
qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net
investment in a foreign operation.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in
the income statement within ‘Finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are
presented in the income statement within ‘Other gains/(losses), net’.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value
through profit or loss, are recognized as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on
non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as available-for-sale, are included in the fair value
reserve in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value
gain or loss.

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**_(iii) Group companies_**

The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:

  - assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date
of that balance sheet

  - income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive income
are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and all
resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income).

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign
entities, and of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are
recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold or any borrowings forming
part of the net investment are repaid, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss,
as part of the gain or loss on sale.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

**2.5 Business Combinations**

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of
whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the:

  - fair values of the assets transferred;

  - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;

  - equity interests issued by the Group;

  - fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and

  - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are,
with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition
basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net
identifiable assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

The excess of the:

  - consideration transferred;

  - amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and

  - acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair value
of the net identifiable assets acquired

is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the
business acquired, the difference is recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are
discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s
incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an
independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a
financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit
or loss.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains
or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.

In case of a combination of entities which are ultimately controlled by the Group before and after the
combination, management has chosen to apply predecessor accounting instead of the acquisition method
of accounting. The assets or liabilities of these entities are not restated to their fair value, instead the
Group incorporates the predecessor carrying values. These are generally the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities of the acquired entities. As the combining entities are looked at from the perspective of a
transfer made by the controlling party, no new goodwill arises from the combination, and any difference
between price paid and the carrying amount of net assets exchanged is recorded as a separate reserve in
equity.

**2.6 Goodwill**

Goodwill is measured as described in Note 3 on the business combinations and in Note 7 after initial
recognition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is shown separately in the statement of financial
position. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in equity accounted for
investments and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance.

Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment
losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the
entity sold.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is
made to those cash-generating units or Groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from
the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or Groups of units are identified at the
lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating
segments.

**2.7 Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recognized when the cost of an asset can be reliably measured and it is probable that
the entity will obtain future economic benefits from the asset over a period extending beyond the current
fiscal year.

At initial measurement, intangible assets are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price,
including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly attributable costs of preparing
the asset for its intended use.

**_(i)_** **_Trademark and customer relationship contracts_**

Separately acquired trademarks are shown at historical cost. Trademarks, licenses and customer
relationship contracts acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition
date. They have a finite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
impairment losses.

**_(ii) Acquired computer software licenses_**

Externally acquired software licenses are stated at historical costs and amortized over its estimated useful
life.

**_(iii) Internally developed software_**

Costs associated with maintaining software programs are recognized as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Group are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria
are met:

  - it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use

  - management intends to complete the software and use or sell it

  - there is an ability to use or sell the software

  - it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

  - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell
the software are available, and

  - the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalized as part of the software include employee costs and an
appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

Development costs are amortized from the point at which the asset is ready for use.

Research expenditure and development expenditure that do not meet the criteria indicated above are
recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not
recognized as an asset in a subsequent period.

**_(iv) Amortization methods and periods of intangible assets_**

The Group amortizes intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the
following periods:

**Intangible assets** **Amortization method** **Amortization periods**

Trademarks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization Between 11 and 20 years
Customer relationships . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization Between 7 and 12 years
Internally generated software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization 3 to 5 years
Acquired computer software licenses . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization 1 to 5 years
Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization 3 to 5 years

**2.8 Property, plant and equipment**

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost may also include transfers
from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property,
plant and equipment.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component
accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenances are
charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The Group depreciates PP&E assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the
following periods:

**Property, plant and equipment** **Depreciation method** **Depreciation periods**

Freehold land . . . . . . . . . . . . . Not depreciated Not depreciated
Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line depreciation 35 years
Plant, machinery and equipment Straight-line depreciation 5 years
Vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line depreciation 5 years
Furniture and office equipment . Straight-line depreciation 5 years
Leased plant and equipment . . . Straight-line depreciation 5 years or shorter if lease term is shorter
Other tangible assets . . . . . . . . Straight-line depreciation 5 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting period.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Refer to impairment of assets for more
information (note 2.11).

PPE is derecognized either on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
disposal.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are
included in profit or loss. When revalued assets are sold, it is Group policy to transfer any amounts
included in other reserves in respect of those assets to retained earnings.

**2.9 Leases**

The Group leases mainly company cars, buildings and IT equipment.

All lease obligations, except for short term leases and low value items are considered on balance sheet, for
which a right-of-use asset and lease liability is accounted for.

Leases are capitalized at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the
present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance
charges, are included in other short-term and long-term payables. Each lease payment is allocated between
the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the profit or loss over the lease period to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The
property, plant and equipment acquired is depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the
asset’s useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain
ownership at the end of the lease term.

The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on their nature.

**2.10 Inventories**

The Group measures its inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs of purchased
inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated
costs necessary to make the sale.

**2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets**

Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are
tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they
might be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purpose of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows
which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating
units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible
reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

**2.12 Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on
hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, and other short-term, highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

**2.13 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations**

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is
considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial
assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under insurance
contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.

An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group)
to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell
of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized.
A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group)
is recognized at the date of derecognition.

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortized
while they are classified as held for sale. Interests and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a
disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognized.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale
are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a
disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of
financial position.

A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for
sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a
single coordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary
acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately
in the statement of profit or loss.

**2.14 Financial assets**

**_(i)_** **_Classification_**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

  - those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss),
and

  - those to be measured at amortized cost.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the
contractual terms of the cash flows.

F-54


-----

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For
investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has
made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets
changes.

**_(ii) Recognition and derecognition_**

Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on trade-date, the date on which the
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive
cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

**_(iii) Measurement_**

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial
asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in
profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether
their cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.

_Debt instruments_

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the
asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the
Group classifies its debt instruments:

  - Amortized cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash
flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost. Interest
income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate
method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss and
presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment
losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

  - FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial
assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are
measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the
recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses
which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative
gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and
recognized in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in
finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are
presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as a separate line item
in the statement of profit or loss.

  - FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL.
A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognized in profit
or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.

_Equity instruments_

The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management
has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent

F-55


-----

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment.
Dividends from such investments continue to be recognized in profit or loss as other income when the
Group’s right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognized in other gains/(losses) in the statement
of profit or loss as applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments
measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

**_(iv) Impairment_**

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated with its debt instruments
carried at amortized cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there
has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables, see Note 11 for further
details.

**_(v) Derivatives_**

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for
subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument,
and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group did not designate certain derivatives as hedge
instruments.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non- current asset or liability when the
remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability
when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as
a current asset or liability.

Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognized immediately in profit or loss and are included in other gains/(losses).

As regards embedded derivatives, the Group assesses whether the derivative is closely related to the host
instrument and accounted for separately or not.

**2.15 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities**

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis
or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be
contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of
default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.

**2.16 Compound financial instruments**

Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible notes that can be converted to
share capital, and the number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value.

The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognized initially at the fair value of a
similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognized
initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the
fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability
and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

F-56

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured
at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial
instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition except on conversion or expiry.

**2.17 Trade receivables and other receivables**

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for sales made in the ordinary course of business. Trade
receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method, less loss allowance. See note 11 for further information about the Group’s
accounting for trade receivables and for a description of the Group’s impairment policies.

If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented
as non-current assets.

The other receivables—projects related to contracts with customers are classified as other receivables.

**2.18 Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Mandatorily redeemable preference shares are classified as
liabilities.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of
tax, from the proceeds.

Where any Group company purchases the company’s equity instruments, for example as the result of a
share buy-back or a share-based payment plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable
incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of House of HR
as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the
related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of House of HR.

**2.19 Dividends**

A liability is recognized for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorized and no
longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the
end of the reporting period.

**2.20 Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are
subsequently carried at amortized cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and
the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the
extent that it is probable that some or all the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred
until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all the
facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over
the period of the facility to which it relates.

The fair value of the liability portion of a convertible bond is determined using a market interest rate for
an equivalent non-convertible bond. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortized cost basis until
extinguishment on conversion or maturity of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the
conversion option. This is recognized and included in shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects.

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is
discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that

F-57

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash
assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss as other income or finance costs.

Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the entity issues equity instruments to a
creditor to extinguish all or part of the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognized in profit
or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the
fair value of the equity instruments issued.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

**2.21 Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the
end of the financial year which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities
unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognized initially at
their fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

**2.22 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets**

**_(i)_** **_Provisions_**

The Group recognizes provisions for legal claims or similar types of obligations when the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of Group management’s best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. Where there are a number of
similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by the
Group by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of
an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre- tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.

In case the Group expects a reimbursement from another party, the Group will recognize a separate asset
when and only when it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received. The amount recognized
for the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of the provision. In the statement of comprehensive
income, the expense relating to a provision may be presented net of the amount recognized for a
reimbursement.

**_(ii) Contingent liabilities and contingent assets_**

The Group does not recognize any contingent liabilities, instead contingent liabilities are disclosed, unless
the possibility of an outflow is remote. The Group discloses the inflow of economic benefits when it is
probable. Contingent assets are recognized when it is virtually certain that the economic benefits will flow
into the Group.

**2.23 Current and deferred income tax**

The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. Tax is recognized in the
statement of financial performance, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity, respectively.

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income
based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.

**_(i)_** **_Current income tax_**

The current income tax charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
end of the reporting period in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures
operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes
provisions where appropriate based on amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

**_(ii) Deferred income tax_**

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of
goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or
liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws)
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to
apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to
utilize those temporary differences and losses.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognized for temporary differences between the carrying
amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the company is able to control the timing
of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax
assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends
either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognized in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

**2.24 Employee benefits**

**_(i)_** **_Short-term obligations_**

The main employee benefits of the Group consist of short-term employee benefits for wages and salaries,
including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be settled
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees rendered the related service.
These liabilities are recognized in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and
are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are
presented as current employee benefit obligations in the statement of financial position.

**_(ii) Pension benefits_**

_Defined contribution plans_

The Group has defined contribution plans as well as disability benefits in certain countries in which it
operates whereby contributions by the Group are funded through payments to independent entities. For
these schemes, the Group’s obligation is limited to the payment of these annual contributions.

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions
are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is
available.

Because of the Belgian legislation applicable to the second pillar pension plans (the so-called ‘‘Wet op de
Aanvullende Pensioenen’’), all Belgian pension plans that are structured as defined contribution plans are
considered defined benefit plans under IFRS. Because of this minimum guaranteed return, the employer is
exposed to a financial risk since further contributions could be required if the return on the assets is not
sufficient to reach the minimum benefits to be paid. The Company has plans that are financed through
insurance contracts. The projected unit credit method has been used as the actuarial technique to measure
the defined benefit obligation. The related assumptions, the defined benefit obligation and related plan
assets are further disclosed in Note 17.

_Defined benefit plans_

The Group does not offer defined benefit plans to its staff. For the specific situation on the Belgian
pension plans, we refer to above.

**_(iii) Other long-term employee benefits_**

Some Group entities provide jubilee benefits rewarding employees for long years of service. The liability
recognized in the statement of financial position is the present value of the obligation at the reporting date.
The remeasurements have been recognized in the statement of financial performance in full.

The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless of
when the actual settlement is expected to occur.

**_(iv) Termination benefits_**

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal
retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.

The Group recognizes termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates:

  - when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and

  - when the entity recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves
the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary
redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected
to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting
period are discounted to present value.

**2.25 Share-based payments**

Share-based compensation benefits are provided to key managers via the long-term incentive plan (LTIP).

The LTIP plan is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment plan.

_Equity settled share-based payments_

The fair value of the goods or services received is recognized with a corresponding increase in equity.

The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made
using an appropriate valuation model.

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

A share-based payment award generally vests upon meeting specified conditions. Vesting conditions are
either:

- Service conditions, which require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service during
which the services are provided to the entity; or

- Performance conditions, which requires the counterparty to complete a specified period of service
(i.e., a service condition) and involves specified performance targets to be met while the counterparty
is rendering the required service.

A performance condition is further defined as either a market condition or a non-market condition. A
market condition is a performance condition (i.e., requires specified targets to be met) and the
performance conditions are related to the market price (or value) of the entity’s equity instruments, such
as: attaining a specified share price or achieving a specified target that is based on the market price (or
value) of the entity’s equity instruments relative to an index of market prices of equity instruments of other
entities. A condition linked to a purely internal financial performance measure, such as profit or earnings
per share, is not a market condition. Such measures will affect the share price, but are not directly linked to
it, and hence are not market conditions. For a market condition to be treated as a performance vesting
condition rather than a non-vesting condition, there must also be an implicit or explicit service condition.

Under IFRS 2, the nature of the condition (i.e., vesting or non-vesting, service, performance, market or
non-market) affects the timing of when the expense is recognized and, in some cases, the measurement of
the expense. In addition, if a condition is not met, whether the entity may reverse the previously recognized
compensation expense depends on the nature of the condition that was not met. Therefore, the
classification of a condition is a critical step in accounting for share-based payment transactions. Market
conditions are only considered when estimating the fair value of the award at the grant date. Non-market
vesting conditions are not considered when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the
grant date. Instead, these vesting conditions are considered by adjusting the number of equity instruments
included in the measurement of the transaction amount so as to reflect the number of awards that are
expected to vest. Such non-market vesting conditions include a service condition.

**2.26 Revenue recognition**

The Group mainly generates revenue from offering temporary staffing solutions to its customers. The
duration of these temporary staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two
years. The Group mainly offers temporary staffing solutions in the following industries: construction
industry, manufacturing industry, logistics industry, sales and finance industry.

The Group also provides solutions to customers active in larger project-oriented businesses (such as the
telecom or the construction industry) where apart from staffing also specific deliverables have to be
provided for. Projects may take one week up to two to three months.

The Group has identified one performance obligation within the vast majority of its customer contracts,
i.e. the delivery of services for a predefined period of time by one or more temping staff or consultants.
Revenue from temporary staffing solutions is traditionally negotiated and invoiced to customers using an
hourly rate (i.e. the transaction price). Temporary workers charge all their worked hours on project codes
which are then accumulated on a weekly or monthly basis and billed to customers. Revenue from
temporary staffing solutions is recognized over time upon rendering the services.

Revenues related to services rendered in the project business are recognized upon the performance of the
service under contract by comparing the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a
proportion of the total services to be provided. This is determined based on the actual costs incurred as
compared to the total expected costs to incur to successfully complete the project.

The Group recognizes project related receivables if the Group has a right to payment for goods and
services already transferred to a customer if that right to payment is conditional on something other than
the passage of time. These project related receivables are recognized as part of the other receivables.

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Contract fulfilment costs related to this project business are capitalized and amortized on a systematic
basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods and services to which these assets relate.

Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change.
Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the
period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known to management.

Customers are invoiced on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis and the consideration is payable when
invoiced.

The Group offers volume rebates to a limited number of customers. The Group applies the ‘most likely
amount method’ for contracts with a single volume threshold and the ‘expected value method’ for contracts
with more than one volume threshold.

The Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or
services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.

For sales arrangements where the Group acts as a principal in the transaction and has the principal risk
and rewards of ownership, including amongst others, the obligation to deliver the services and the credit
risk, revenue is reported gross by the Group. Under arrangements where the Group acts as an agent,
revenue is reported on a net basis.

**2.27 Interest income**

Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired,
the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow
discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument and continues unwinding the discount as
interest income. Interest income on impaired loans and receivables is recognized using the original
effective interest rate.

**3 Group structure of the House of HR**

Since the creation of the Belgian Accent Group in 1995, the Group has significantly expanded its business
as a result of a number of important and material external acquisitions. All these acquisitions are in-line
with the mid- to long-term strategy of the House of HR to gain a more international foothold and to
become a Group mainly offering services around specialized recruitment and engineering consulting. The
Group is now active in more than 10 European countries.

As part of the legal reorganization of the Group completed in 2018, the majority of the minority
shareholders, which represented former management of the acquired companies, exchanged their
non-controlling interests, together with any related shareholder loans (financial liabilities recognized in
various entities of the Group) for cash and new shares issued by the parent company of the Group.
Consequently, the Group currently holds into the majority of its subsidiaries 100% of the issued shares.

All non-controlling interests held by former management in the Redmore and Vialegis Group were
acquired by the Group as per 14 January 2019. These minority shareholders exchanged their
noncontrolling interests, together with any related shareholder loans for cash and new shares issued by the
Group. Once the transaction was completed, the Group owned all equity instruments of both subsidiaries.
The consideration paid for acquiring these non-controlling interests amounted to EUR 23,5 million. The
carrying amount of these non-controlling interests prior to these acquisitions amounted to EUR
18,5 million. EUR 22,1 million of these non-controlling interests were bought in exchange for shares of
HOHR, EUR 1,4 million has been paid in cash. Next to that, EUR 2.5 million (shareholder) loans have
been contributed in exchange for equity.

As a result of the changes in the equity held by non-controlling interests, the Group has adjusted the
carrying amounts of the controlling and any remaining non-controlling interests to reflect the changes in
their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid are directly recognized into equity.

**3.1** **Business Combinations**

**_(i)_** **_Overview of completed acquisitions_**

While the Group obtains control over the acquired entities, the Group does not always acquire all of the
issued shares of these entities. The remaining shares are held by the former management of the acquired
entities. To facilitate the acquisitions, new holdings are created in which the Group and the minority
shareholders both contribute into the share capital in relation to the shares in the holding held by them.
These holdings are consolidated in full by the Group. Amounts allocated to the minority shareholders are
recognized as a separate component of the equity of the Group.

**Movement in minorities**

Next to the roll-over of Redmore and Vialegis resulting in a 100% ownership in both subsidiaries (cf. supra
note 3.0), following movements in minorities have occurred during 2019:

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Group structure of the House of HR (Continued)**

_Accounting policy choice for non-controlling interests_

IFRS allows the Group to recognize the non-controlling interests in an acquired entity either at fair value
or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. This
decision is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.

Group Management decided to recognize all the non-controlling interests at fair value.

_Acquired receivables_

The following table summarizes the fair value of acquired trade receivables as per acquisition date:

**Total acquired** **Total acquired**
**Acquired receivables** **receivables per 2019** **receivables per 2018**

Contractual amount of trade receivables due . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.727.685 82.877.108
Amount of uncollectible trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �28.878 �676.812

**Fair value of acquired trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **13.698.807** **82.200.296**

The gross amount of the acquired trade receivables approximates its fair value. As per 31 December 2019
an amount of EUR 0.03 million has been impaired. Group management is expecting that the full
contractual amounts can be collected.

_Revenue and profit contribution_

The acquired businesses contributed since their acquisition dates the following amount of revenue and net
profit to the Group:

**Contribution to revenue and net profit since the date of the acquisition** **Total 2019** **Total 2018**

Revenue: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.407.621 195.848.241
Net profit: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �461.919 9.324.297

If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January of the year, consolidated pro-forma revenue and net profit
for the year ended would have been:

**Contribution to revenue and net profit as if the acquisition was completed per 1 January** **Total 2019** **Total 2018**

Revenue: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61.277.166 310.720.834
Net profit: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.885.375 17.213.065

These amounts have been calculated using the subsidiary’s results, adjusting them for:

  - differences in the accounting policies between the Group and the subsidiary, and

  - the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair
value adjustments to intangible assets had applied from 1 January of every year, together with the
consequential tax effects.

_Contingent assets and contingent liabilities_

The Group did not recognize any material contingent asset or contingent liabilities under the purchase
price allocation exercise.

31 December 2019.

All these costs have been expensed within the statement of financial performance at the transaction date.

**_(iii) Acquisitions completed after year-end_**

The Group, via its subsidiary Continu, has acquired 100% of the shares in Techmatch as per 23 January
2020. Techmatch is an independent engineering staffing specialist, specialized in mechanical engineering,
process engineering and electrical engineering. The consideration paid for acquiring 100% of the shares
amounts to EUR 6.75 million (excluding earn-out).

**3.2 Interests in joint ventures**

The Group has no interests in joint ventures as per December 31, 2019.

**3.3 Interests in associates**

_Significant restrictions on certain assets within the subsidiaries_

Cash and short-term deposits held in the Netherlands are subject to local exchange control regulations.
These regulations provide for restrictions on exporting capital from those countries, other than through
normal dividends. The carrying amount of the assets included within the consolidated financial statements
to which these restrictions apply is EUR 2,98 million as per 31 December 2019.

**_(ii) Overview of material joint ventures_**

There are no joint ventures per 31 December 2019.

**4 Financial risk management**

**4.1 Financial risk factors**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including limited foreign
exchange risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and
seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The objective is to
identify, quantify, manage and then monitor events or actions that could lead to financial losses. The
Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain interest risk exposures. In particular, the
Group protects the variable interest rate on loans via the use of caps that limit the exposure to fluctuations
of Euribor.

Risk management is carried out by the Group’s treasury. Group’s treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges
financial risks with approval from the board of directors.

The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is very limited as the Group’s operations are essentially
denominated in euro. Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of these currencies of +/�10% is considered
as immaterial.

_Interest rate risk_

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.

Interest rate caps in place cover 50% of the long-term bank borrowings at year-end 2018 of the variable
loan principal outstanding. These caps have been terminated and cancelled with effect as from 12 July
2019, following the refinancing that took place in July 2019. No new hedging instruments were set up in the
meantime to cover any potential interest rate risk.

At 31 December 2018, the Group had EUR 600 million of outstanding bank loans, structured as a bullet
loan under the Senior Facility Agreement. Following the refinancing in July 2019, this amount changed to
EUR 550 million, structured in the same way i.e. as a bullet loan under the Senior Facility Agreement.
Once per year, excess cash flow is calculated based on final audited accounts which serve to determine
whether a mandatory prepayment should take place under this agreement. So far, no mandatory
prepayments have taken place. These loans are floating rate borrowings, with interest based on Euribor
floored to zero plus a fixed margin of 4.25% if leverage is greater than or equal to 3.25x. At year-end 2018,
50% of these floating rate borrowings have been hedged via caps. Following the refinancing in July 2019,
so far no hedging instruments are in place to cover any interest rate risk for the bank loans under the new
Senior Facility Agreement.

At December 2019, the Group had EUR 370 million of outstanding senior secured notes, due in 2026, with
a fixed interest rate of 4.375%.

The floating rate borrowings are entirely accounted for at amortized cost, and therefore the impact of
changes in the market interest rate on the fair value of these floating rate borrowings at the closing date
will have no impact on the income statement or on the equity. The Group does not apply hedge
accounting.

Euribor floating rate borrowings which are not covered by the swaps are subject to interest rate risk. An
increase (decrease) of 100 basis points in interest rate as per year-end would have an effect on profit after
tax and equity as follows:

ended 31 December 2019.

**4 Financial risk management (Continued)**

_Credit risk_

Credit risk for the Group mainly arises from cash and cash equivalents, favorable derivative financial
instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers,
including outstanding receivables.

_Risk management_

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk other than that for ordinary debtors. The Group
has policies to ensure that the services are provided to customers with an appropriate credit history.

Credit risk is managed locally by each subgroup (brand). Certain subsidiaries have credit insurance in
place. Negotiations are ongoing to further implement this for the entire group. Credit risk mainly arises as
credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables.

The credit quality of customers, considering the financial position of customers, past experience and other
factors, is closely assessed by the credit department on a regular basis. Individual risk limits are set based
on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the finance committee. The utilization of
credit limits is regularly monitored.

No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does not expect any losses
from non-performance by these counterparties.

_Impairment of financial assets_

The Group has three types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model:

  - trade receivables for sales of services;

  - receivables resulting from project services in progress;

  - debt investments carried at amortized cost.

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was no
identified impairment loss.

_Trade receivables_

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk
characteristics and the days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before each
reporting year-end and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The
historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macro-economic
factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2019 was determined as follows for both trade
receivables:

**More than** **More than** **More than**
**30 days** **60 days** **1 year**
**At 31 December 2019** **Current** **past due** **past due** **past due** **Total**

Trade receivables and project related receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of
recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure
of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group, and a failure to make contractual payments for
a period of greater than 120 days past due. Several factors are considered in assessing the likelihood of
impairment which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and project related receivables are presented as net impairment
losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against
the same line item.

The Group first applies this policy under the incurred loss model, and then, for the rest of receivables
which are not provided for, the Group applies the expected credit loss model, and recognizes an additional
provision.

_Liquidity risk_

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and use of trade supplier credit terms.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group
treasury. Group treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has
sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed
borrowing facilities (Note 15) at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants
(where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s
debt financing plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets and, if
applicable external regulatory or legal requirements. The Group also uses factoring agreements with
certain banks in order to obtain early access to cash flows.

Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above balance required for working capital
management is transferred to the Group treasury. Surplus cash is retained to finance future growth of the
Group through acquisitions.

The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative and derivative financial liabilities into relevant
maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and include future
contractual interest payments. As a result, those amounts differ from the balances in the statement of

In order to meet its cash outflow obligations, the Group uses cash flows generated from operating activities
and credit facilities with financial institutions if necessary. In order to mitigate the liquidity obligations in
the less than one-year bucket, cash flows from revolving credit facilities with drawdown rights for
additional EUR 96,00 million are available until the termination date of SFA, 26 July 2026.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain
an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Group is required to comply with the financial
covenant that the leverage ratio must be not more than 6.0:1.

The Group has complied with this covenant throughout the reporting period. As at 31 December 2019, the
leverage ratio of the Group (net debt to normalized EBITDA; i.e. EBITDA adjusted on the basis of the
SFA agreement) was 3.95:1.

_Dividends_

In general no dividends are paid out to majority shareholders. For the dividends declared to minority
shareholders, please refer to the Note 3.4 on non-controlling interest.

**4.3 Fair value estimation**

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as trading and available- for-sale
securities) is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted (unadjusted) market price
used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in
level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example,
over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of
methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt. Other
techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the
estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using
quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date. The fair value of fuel price derivatives is determined
by using the fair values of the adjusted future positions at the end of the year. These instruments are
included in level 2.

The instruments included in level 3 are those for which one or more significant inputs are not based on
observable market data.

The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to
approximate their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by
discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the
Group for similar financial instruments.

The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured or disclosed at fair value
at 31 December 2019 and 2018:

There are no enforceable master netting arrangements. The related receivable and payable in the
statement of financial position are presented gross while upon payment the net position is settled.

The Group has pledged cash on bank accounts, intercompany receivables, and shares of the Group and the
most material subsidiaries, as described in the Note 15 on borrowings. In case of default, the banks would
be able to cover the debt from cash and intercompany receivables as shown in the table above, and the rest
in shares of the Group and related subsidiaries.

**5 Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could
result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities
affected in future periods.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and
of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be
wrong.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

**5.1 Accounting judgements**

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following
judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial
statements:

**_Determination of the consolidation scope of the Group_**

Refer to Note 3.1 for more information.

**5 Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (Continued)**

**_Accounting for factoring agreements within the Group_**

The Group entered into factoring agreements with banks, under which trade receivables of certain entities
within the Group are transferred to the factors. These entities are part of Accent Group, and the factoring
arrangements involve ING, Belfius and KBC Bank. Significant judgement is needed in order to assess
whether the criteria for derecognition of these assets under IFRS 9 has been met, and whether the Group
can derecognize trade receivables at the moment of transfer to the factors.

In order to meet the IFRS 9 criteria for the derecognition, substantially all risks and rewards of ownership
related to the financial asset (i.e. receivable) need to be transferred to the factor.

As from 2018 a new factoring agreement was agreed which transferred all risks and rewards of ownership
to the factor, resulting in a derecognition of the trade receivables at the moment of transfer to the factors.

**_Capitalization of development costs_**

The Group internally develops software applications that are used in the day-to-day service offerings.

Development costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2. Initial capitalization
of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility of the internally
developed software is confirmed. Group management makes assumptions regarding the expected future
cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits.

**5.2 Critical judgements in applying the entities’ accounting policies**

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below.

The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial
statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however,
may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such
changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

**_Impairment testing on goodwill_**

Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable
amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in an
arm’s length transaction of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing
of the asset.

The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the
budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet
committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the
cash-generating unit being tested.

The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as
well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.

The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash-generating units,
including a sensitivity analysis, are further explained in Note 7.

**_Fair value of financial instruments_**

The Group has a Senior Facility Agreement and Senior Secured Notes. A derivative financial liability has
been recognized in relation the embedded derivate—the right for to exercise an early payment option. As
this option is not considered to be closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**5 Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (Continued)**

recognized separately from the host contract and has been measured at fair value on initial recognition and
subsequently at fair value through income statement. The value of the option is calculated by comparing
the present value of the cash flows, assuming no prepayment takes places, discounted by the interest rate
including an option adjusted spread, minus the market value of the bond. For more details refer to Note 10
on derivatives.

**_Share-based payment plans_**

The Group has offered to a selected group of managers share-based compensation benefits, in order to
incentivize them to further develop the activities of the Group. The value of the LTIP at grant date has
been calculated based on the equity value of the entity, excluding the value of the tracking shares.
Judgement was made in order to determine these assumptions. For more detail, refer to the Note 18.

**_Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination_**

As part of the purchase price allocations that were completed by the Group for the recent acquisitions of
the Group, both brand names and customer relationships have been accounted for by the Group at their
estimated fair value. In determining the fair value of these intangible assets, assumptions and estimates are
made in relation to the long-term growth rate, discount rates and contributory asset charges. Refer to
note 3.1 for more information.

**_Taxes_**

Uncertainties may exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws,
and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business
relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences
arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could
necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.

The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by
the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based
on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations
by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.

Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions
prevailing in the respective Group company’s domicile. As the Group assesses the probability for litigation
and subsequent cash outflow with respect to taxes as remote, no contingent liability has been recognized.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgement is
required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely
timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

**_Useful life and residual value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment_**

Judgement is required in estimating the useful lives and residual value of intangible and tangible assets.
The residual value is the estimated amount that would be currently obtained from the disposal of the asset,
after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset was already of the age and in the condition
expected at the end of its useful life.

Group management reviews its estimated useful life as well as the residual value of intangible and tangible
assets on an annual basis.

Refer to the PP&E note (Note 8) and intangible assets note (Note 6) for more information.

**_Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options_**

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods
covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered
by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms between 3 and
9 years. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option
to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the
renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event
or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the
option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy).

The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of its buildings due to the
significance of these assets to its operations when it is reasonably certain that these renewal options will be
exercised by the Group. The renewal options for leases of motor vehicles were not included as part of the
lease term because the Group has a policy of leasing motor vehicles for not more than five years and hence
not exercising any renewal options.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**6 Intangible assets (Continued)**

**_(i) Acquisition related intangible assets_**

The carrying amounts of the customer relationships and the brand names as per 31 December 2019
amount to EUR 126,42 million and EUR 55,58 million, respectively.

The customer relationships and brand names were acquired as part of a business combination. They are
recognized at their fair value at the date of acquisition and are subsequently amortized on a straight-line
based on the timing of projected cash flows of the contracts over their estimated useful lives.

The fair value is determined on a basis that reflects an amount that the entity would have paid for the asset
in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties, based on the best information
available.

Refer to the Business Combination note (Note 3.1) for more information on the additions to the customer
relationships and the brand names.

**_(ii) Software_**

The Group capitalizes amounts of both externally acquired software and internally developed software.
Internally developed software is initially classified under the category ‘‘Software under development’’ and
is transferred to the category ‘‘Internally generated software’’ once the software becomes available for use.
As from that moment amortizations will start.

_Externally acquired software_

The carrying amount of externally acquired software amounts to EUR 2,56 million as per 31 December
2019.

The main amounts recorded for externally acquired software relate to licenses for ERP packages used
within the Group (mainly Tagetik and Navision). The additions in 2019 mainly relate to further
enhancements of these ERP packages.

_Internally developed software and software under development_

The carrying amount of internally generated software amounts to EUR 14,18 million as per 31 December
2019.

The carrying amount of software under development amounts to EUR 1,39 million as per 31 December
2019.

The majority of the internally developed software as well as the software under development relates to new
features in the ‘‘MyAccent app’’, the new ‘‘SWOP app’’ and the ‘‘SWOP stage app’’. Also the ‘‘My tools’’
digital platform that is used by Accent Jobs for People to run the HR business is being further developed,
with main focus on the integration between the ‘‘My tools’’ platform and other tools such as
‘‘SuccessFactors’’.

The Group did not expense a material amount of research and development expenditure in the income
statement.

**_(iii) Other intangibles_**

The carrying amounts of the other intangibles as per 31 December 2019 are EUR 0,12 million.

Amortizations on intangible assets are charged to the Selling Expenses (EUR 23,00 million) and the
General and administrative expenses (EUR 5,69 million) in the statement of financial performance.

**7 Goodwill**

Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated by Group management to the following 3
cash-generating units for goodwill impairment purposes:

  - General staffing: General temp agencies delivering candidates to clients in a fast and flexible
way, whenever they are shorthanded.

The general staffing CGU is composed of the Zaquensis Group and the TimePartner Group,
excluding AERO, IBB and Mach which are part of the CGU engineering and consulting.

  - Specialized staffing: The Group strongly believes it requires specialists to hire specialists. The
Group’s specialized staffing companies know their niches and their clients like no one else. The
Accent Group and Covebo Group are considered as specialized staffing entities.

  - Engineering & consulting: The Group recruits highly skilled professionals to work in fast
evolving sectors like energy, pharmaceuticals, technology etc. Search and selection, interim
management or secondment—in line with client needs.

The engineering & consulting CGU is composed of the TEC Group, Vialegis, Abylsen, Continu,
Redmore and part of the TimePartner Group, being AERO, IBB and Mach.

**Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units**

Movements in the goodwill as well as the allocation of the goodwill to the different cash-generating units at
year-end is shown in the following table:

**Key assumptions used in value in use calculations**

The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. For the 31 December
2019 reporting period, the recoverable amount of the CGU’s was determined based on value-in-use
calculations which require the use of assumptions.

The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a
five-year window for the 2019 impairment. Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using
the estimated growth rates stated below. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts included in
industry reports specific to the industry in which each CGU operates.

The calculation of value in use for all CGU’s are most sensitive to the following assumptions:

**As at 31 December 2019**
**Pre-tax** **EBITDA** **Growth**
**CGU** **discount rate** **margin** **rate**

General staffing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,19% 7,40% 2,00%
Specialized staffing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,31% 10,36% 2,00%
Consulting and egineering . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,07% 18,79% 2,00%

  - **_Pre-tax discount rates: Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific_**
to each cash-generating unit, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the
underlying assets which have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**7 Goodwill (Continued)**

calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and
derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both
debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the
Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on the interest-bearing borrowings the Group is
obliged to service. Segment-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. The
beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.

- **_EBITDA Margin: The EBITDA margins are based upon past performance and management’s_**
expectations for the future.

- **_Growth rate estimates: Rates are based on published inflation rates provided by the IMF (International_**
Monetary Fund). For the reasons explained above, the long-term rate is used to extrapolate the
projections.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

With regard to the assessment of value in use of the three CGU’s, being Specialized Staffing, Consulting
and Engineering and General Staffing, Group’s management believes that no reasonably possible change
in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its
recoverable amount.

The CGU Specialized Staffing and Consulting and Engineering are strong markets for which nor a 0%
sales increase nor a decrease in EBITDA of 5%, nor an increase in WACC up to 3BP impacts the carrying
amount of the goodwill.

The CGU General Staffing is under pressure as a result of the AUG-reform in 2018, impacting the
performance of the business in Germany. Sensitivity analysis has shown sufficient headroom in calculating
the carrying value of this CGU, as a 0% sales growth in the perpetuity or 5% EBITDA drop does not show
an impairment risk. Also an increase in WACC of 1,5BP does not result in an impairment risk.

**10 Derivative financial instruments**

The Group has the following derivative financial instruments:

**_(i)_** **_Interest rate swaps and rate swaps_**

HOHR has entered into interest rate swaps and interest rate cap contracts to limit the Group’s exposure to
changes in the variable interest rate for the bank loans under the Senior Facility Agreement set up in
December 2017. However, with the refinancing in July 2019 these caps were terminated.

The interest rate swaps a variable interest rate on the external borrowings against a fixed interest rate. The
interest rate cap limits the variability of the interest rate.

There were no interest rate swaps within the Group as per 31 December 2018 nor per 31 December 2019.

**_(ii) Early payment option on SSN_**

The Group has Senior Secured Notes of EUR 370,00 million as disclosed in borrowing (please refer to
note 15 for more details). A derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to an embedded
derivative—the right for the issuer to exercise an early payment option. As this option is not considered to
be closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized and has been measured at the
fair value on initial recognition with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. At
year-end 2019, a derivative financial asset of EUR 7,57 million has been recognized. The fair value at
moment of issuance of the SSN was valued at EUR 4,08 million. The difference in fair value has been
recorded via P&L, as finance income (refer to note 28).

The prepayment option is valued by taking the difference between two loan values. The first loan value is
calculated by discounting all cash flows of the loan with the interest rate at the time of the cash flow being
paid plus a constant spread; this value represents the value of the loan without a prepayment option.
Regarding the second loan value, the cash flows are also discounted by the interest rate at the time of the
cash flow being paid plus a constant spread, however, the amount of cash flows will decrease if the interest
rate drops, e.g. the loan is prepaid. Since the option will only be exercised if this is beneficial to the holder,
the value of the option is floored at zero. This process is repeated for 10 thousand (risk-neutral) interest
simulations of which the average is taken in order to determine the price of the option at this time. The
valuation is done under the assumption that the loan is prepaid on the first payment date after the 7 year
forward rate at a point in time of the simulation passes below the initial 7-year forward rate, the
prepayment option should be priced in a risk-neutral setting and a regular smooth spline through the
curves is fitted in order to interpolate different points on the curve.

The Group does not use derivatives for speculative investments.

**_(i)_** **_Classification as current trade receivables_**

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of
business. Trade receivables have varying due dates, a period of 0–90 days comprises the range for credit
terms. Therefore, they are classified as current asset. Trade receivables are recognized initially at the
amount of the consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components,

**11 Trade and other receivables (Continued)**

when they are recognized at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect
the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortized cost using the effective
interest method.

**_(ii) Transferred receivables_**

A commercial finance agreement of EUR 50,00 million is applicable at the level of Accent and GRITT. As
the late payment risk and credit risk has been transferred to the counterparty, this agreement has been
accounted for as a non-recourse agreement. At year-end 2019, EUR 28,35 million out of the
EUR 50,00 million was used, which has been deducted from the open trade receivables as per
December 31, 2019.

**_(iii) Fair value of receivables_**

Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same
as their fair value.

**_(iv) Impairment and risk exposure_**

Information about the impairment of trade receivables and the Group’s exposure to credit risk can be
found in Note 4. As the Group is mainly active in the EURO-zone, there is no exposure to foreign
currency risk. There is also no exposure to price risk as the investments will be held to maturity.

**11.2 Other financial assets at amortized cost**

The Group classifies its financial assets at amortized cost only if both of the following criteria are met:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and

- the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

Financial assets at amortized costs as per 31 December 2019 include:

**31 December** **31 December**
**Other financial assets at amortized cost** **2019** **2018**

**_(i)_** **_Other non-current assets_**

The other non-current assets outstanding at year-end mainly relate mainly to financial guarantees paid by
the Group for its ongoing lease contracts of branches and housing accommodation.

**_(ii) Other current receivables_**

The main amounts of other current receivables are related to accruals for income to be received/costs to be
carried forward, grants receivables and amounts recoverable for VAT.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**11 Trade and other receivables (Continued)**

**_(iii) CICE Receivable_**

CICE receivables arise from tax credits under the French Competitive Employment Act (CICE) are no
longer applicable as from current year 2019. These have transferred to a reduction in the employer
contributions and are hence considered part of the payroll liabilities at year-end 2019.

**_(iv) Fair values of other financial assets at amortized cost_**

Due to the short-term nature of the other current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be
the same as their fair value. For the non-current receivables, the fair values are also not significantly
different to their carrying amounts.

**_(v) Impairment and risk exposure_**

The Group did not account any loss allowances on the other receivables. As the Group is mainly active in
the EURO-zone, there is no exposure to foreign currency risk. There is also no exposure to price risk as
the investments will be held to maturity.

**_(vi) Other receivables—projects_**

Project related receivables result from project services in progress for which the right to payment of goods
or services have been transferred to the customer. This relates to projects that typically cover a period of
more than one year. An ageing review has been performed on the outstanding balance per 31 December
2019 for which a loss allowance has been recorded of EUR 1,66 million, mainly relating to old projects for
which there is uncertainty with regards to the recoverability of the receivable. Refer to note 21.2 with
respect to this matter.

The weighted average applicable tax rate was 52%. Primary drivers that impacted the effective tax rates
include the following:

**_(i)_** **_Expenses not deductible for income tax purposes_**

The recurring expenses not deductible for tax purposes include permanent differences such as expenses
which are non-deductible under local tax laws (e.g. car expenses and meal expenses).

In 2018, a new option plan was executed at the level of the shareholders of HOHR and has been accounted
for as an employee benefit expense.

**_(ii) Re-measurement of deferred tax—change in domestic tax rates_**

The impact of the re-measurement of deferred taxes mainly relates to changes in the applicable income tax
rates in Belgium and the Netherlands.

The Belgian Corporate Income Tax regime has been modified by the Belgian Government by means of the
Corporate Income Tax Reform Act of 25 December 2017 (Official Gazette of 29 December 2017). This
reform includes a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 33,99% to 29,58% from the year ending
31 December 2018 with further reduction to 25% as from the year 31 December 2020. Further to the
Belgian tax reform, the use of certain deductions will be limited to EUR 1 million. Therefore, 30% of the
tax base in excess of EUR 1 million cannot be offset. The limitation applies to carried forward tax losses,
carried forward participation exemption, carried forward innovation deduction, as well as the new
incremental notional interest deduction.

**House of HR NV (HOHR)—Consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**12 Income tax (Continued)**

As a result of the reform, Group management remeasured its deferred income tax balances. Deferred
income taxes expected to be reversed in the year to 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2019 have been
measured using the effective rate that will apply in Belgium for the period (29,58%). Deferred income
taxes expected to be reversed beyond 31 December 2019 have been measured with an effective rate of
25%.

Also the Corporate Income Tax regime in the Netherlands has been modified. This reform includes a
reduction of the corporate tax rate from 25% from the year ending 31 December 2018 and 2019 to 22,55%
from the year ending 31 December 2020, with a further decrease to 20,5% as from the year ending
31 December 2021.

The impact of this change in the tax rate has been recognized in the tax expense in profit and loss except to
the extent that it relates to items previously recognized outside of profit and loss. For the Group, these
items are limited to the translation of foreign operations using a different presentation currency as the one
applied by the Group.

**_(iii) Unrecognized income tax assets_**

The Group decided not to recognize additional deferred income tax assets on losses carried forward in
some of its entities as the Group believes that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is not probable.

The majority of the unrecognized deferred income tax losses relates to the House of HR NV, the entity on
which the Corporate projects are performed that are applicable for the total group, and GRITT Projects.
As no deferred tax asset has been recognized on the (accumulated) losses, this impacts the Effective Tax
Rate as presented in above table.

**_(iv) Adjustment in respect of prior years_**

The Group has been subject to tax audits on some of its Belgian operational entities. The Group has fully
cooperated with the authorities and an additional tax liability has been agreed on.

**12.2 Amounts recognized directly in equity**

The following deferred income taxes have been recognized directly in equity:

**31 December** **31 December**

**12.3 Deferred taxes**

Using the balance sheet liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to provide for
temporary differences between the value of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
for tax purposes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same tax jurisdiction.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**12 Income tax (Continued)**

Deferred income tax assets are recognized for tax losses carried forward, excluding unused notional
interest deduction (NID), to the extent that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable, i.e. in those companies where, based on business projections over a period of
10 years, the company estimates that the losses can be utilized within this timeframe.

The Group did not recognize deferred income taxes for:

**31 December** **31 December**
**Amount of unrecognised deferred income tax assets** **2019** **2018**

These relate for the main part to House of HR, the entity on which the Corporate projects are performed
that are applicable for the total group, and GRITT Projects. Main foreign entities have a tax consolidation
available that allow them to compensate the tax losses with the tax gains.

Refer to 12.1 (iii) for detail on the losses carried forward.

The cash and cash equivalents disclosed above and in the statement of cash flows include EUR 2,98 million
of restricted cash. These deposits are subject to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands (system of
G-accounts containing amounts for taxes to be paid on salaries) and are therefore not available for general
use by the other entities within the Group.

As indicated in Note 15 on the borrowings, the Group’s current and future cash and cash equivalents are
pledged as security for these borrowings. The entire amount of the Group’s bank borrowings and accrued
interest are secured according to collective pledge agreements.

**_(i)_** **_Borrowings_**

_Bank borrowings_

During December 2017, the bank loans were refinanced with a new Senior Facility Agreement at the
Corporate level with variable interest rates. The carrying amount of the drawings, net of transaction cost,
was EUR 456,9 million. The drawings as per 31 December 2017 had 7 years of maturity and a variable
interest rate based on Euribor plus a margin. In March 2018, the additional tranche of EUR 125,00 million
was withdrawn under the same terms.

In July 2019, the bank loans were refinanced with a new Senior Facility Agreement at Corporate level of
EUR 550,00 million with variable interest rates, together with an issuance of Senior Secured Notes of
EUR 320,00 million. In August 2019 additional senior secured notes were issued of EUR 50,00 million.

All these loans were initially measured at fair value, with subsequent measurement at amortized cost. The
conditions for the new loan are similar to the proceeding loan. As a result, refinancing expenses relating to
2017 refinancing remain capitalized and are amortized over the lifetime of the new loan. Refinancing
expenses for the 2019 refinancing have also been capitalized and are being depreciated over the lifetime of
the loan.

The SSN has an option for early repayment. This option has been valued at EUR 4,08 million at
refinancing date, which is included in the fair value of the bank borrowings and amortized over the lifetime
of the SSN.

_Vendor loans_

Vendor loans at 31 December 2019 relate to loans provided by shareholders of Covebo and Schollmeyer.

_Significant assumptions taken for the fair value calculations at initial measurement_

For the majority of the borrowings, the fair values are not materially different to their carrying amounts
since the interest payable on those borrowings is either close to current market rates or the borrowings are

of a short-term nature. The difference between the fair value and carrying value in the table below for the

**_(ii) Financial covenants_**

Under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Group is required to comply with the financial
covenant that the leverage ratio must be not more than 6.0:1.

The Group has complied with this covenant throughout the reporting period. As at 31 December 2019, the
leverage ratio of the Group (net debt to normalized EBITDA; i.e. EBITDA adjusted on the basis of the
SFA agreement) was 3.95:1.

**_(iii) Collateral for the Group’s bank borrowings_**

For the bank loans in place (SFA loan agreements), multiple pledge agreements have been entered into
which collectively secure the bank borrowings for the entire amount outstanding and accrued interest on
the bank borrowings. The Group is subject to regular bank reporting, and leverage is monitored. In the
event of a default of repayment of the bank borrowings and related interest payments, the pledgee may
enforce against the pledged assets. During the period under review, there was no default of the payment
obligations.

The present and future assets pledged as collateral include the following:

  - All of the shares of the HOHR and material subsidiaries;

  - All bank accounts of the HOHR and material subsidiaries;

  - All of the intercompany loan receivables of the Group and material subsidiaries (excluding cash
pooling).

We and our affiliates, or agents acting on our or their behalf, may retain, purchase, or sell for our own
account any of our outstanding publicly traded Notes, and may subsequently re-offer or re-sell any such
Notes purchased. We do not intend to disclose the extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise
than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligation we may have to do so.

**_(i)_** **_Provisions for dismantling obligations_**

The Group signed a number of lease contracts for branches and headquarters in which mandatory
dismantling obligations exist. The amount accrued represents the net present value of the estimated
cash-outflows that the Group expects to incur upon termination of the contract to dismantle all leasehold
improvements made to the leased properties. The total costs as per 31 December 2019 for dismantling the
leasehold improvements amount to EUR 0,68 million.

**_(ii) Provisions for litigations_**

The amount represents provisions for certain legal claims brought against the Group by former staff
members. The provision charge is recognized in the income statement within the ‘‘Other general and
administrative expenses’’. Management’s view is that the outcome of these legal claims will not give rise to
any significant loss beyond the amounts provided for at 31 December 2019.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**17 Employee benefit obligations (Continued)**

**17.2 Post-employment employee benefits**

**_(i)_** **_Pension plans_**

The Group offers a number of defined contribution plans to its employees. Because of the Belgian
legislation applicable to the second pillar pension plans (the so-called ‘‘Wet op de Aanvullende
Pensioenen’’), all Belgian pension plans that are structured as defined contribution plans are considered
defined benefit plans under IFRS. Because of this minimum guaranteed return, the Group is exposed to a
financial risk since further contributions could be required if the return on the assets is not sufficient to
reach the minimum benefits to be paid. The Group has plans that are financed through insurance
contracts. The Group carefully reviewed the different pension plans at the different reporting periods and
concluded that the application of the projected unit credit method to calculate the defined benefit
obligation would not result in a material amount to be accounted for on the statement of financial position.
No similar minimum funding exists in other countries where the Group is active.

The Group does not provide any material defined benefit plans to its employees.

**_(ii) Disability benefits_**

The Group also provides disability benefits to its employees which have similar terms and conditions as the
defined contribution plans and therefore also have to be accounted for in a similar way. As the Group is
insured for these disability benefits, no provision has been accounted for by the Group.

**17.3 Other long-term employee benefits**

Amounts reported for under the Other long-term employee benefits fully relate to jubilee premiums
offered by The Group rewarding employees for long years of service. The Group also provides sickness
compensations to its staff in the Netherlands.

**_(i)_** **_Jubilee benefits_**

The following table shows the split between the non-current and the current employee jubilee benefits:

**17 Employee benefit obligations (Continued)**

**_(ii) Termination benefits_**

The termination benefits relate to outstanding payables towards former employees, mainly key
management. Refer to note 32 Related Parties for more information.

**18 Share-based payments**

The share-based payments consist of the long-term incentive plan on the level of the shareholders of
HOHR.

The Group launched a share-based payment plan throughout 2018 offering the management team to
participate in a long- term incentive plan. The purpose of the plan is to create an incentive for members of
management and executives of the Group who can make an important contribution to the success and the
growth of the Group, to help the Group retaining and attracting managers with the necessary experience
and skills, and to align the interests of those managers with the grantors’ interests as shareholders of the
Company and give them the opportunity to share in the value creation and growth of the Group.

The share options are granted free of charge at the grant date, i.e. 28 August 2018. The exercise price of
the options is equal to the current fair market value of the shares (EUR 2.17).

The term of the options runs from the grant date until 28 June 2023 for Belgian tax residents (5 years
maximum vesting period). For other beneficiaries, the term of validity is maximum 10 years.

The plan is settled in the ordinary shares of the Company. The option holder may exercise the options
subject to the occurrence of an exit event, a non-exit event or a good leaver event.

The plan contains a number of vesting conditions:

a) Service conditions—the beneficiary should have a contractual relationship with the group at the
vesting date (in case of an exit or a non-exit event) or qualify as a good leaver (in case of a good
leaver event);

b) Performance conditions—the number of options that vest (and can be exercised) is determined at
the vesting date and depends on the return (or a deemed return) of the grantors on the initial
value (effectively the increase in the fair value of the shares of the Group since 31/12/2017).

This LTIP is comprised of 100 million share options, of which 75 million are granted during 2018 (effective
grant date: 28 August 2018), 12,5 million during 2019 and 12,5 million during 2020. The fair value per
share option at grant date amounts to A2,17. For the shares granted in 2019, the fair value per share
amounts to A1,33. The value of the shares has been determined based on an EBITDA-multiple model
(correcting for net debt) and is recognized in P&L based on the exit probability. The share options have a
contractual life of 5 years for Belgian tax residents and 10 years for other residents. The options are
granted for no consideration. As a result of the accounting for the LTIP during the period, an expense has
been recognized in the income statement with a corresponding credit in equity in 2018 for
EUR 13,95 million and EUR 4,65 million in 31 December 2019.

The value of the LTIP at grant date has been calculated based on the equity value of the entity, excluding
the value of the tracking shares.

The carrying amounts of trade and other payables are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to
their short-term nature.

Trade and other payables have decreased compared to last year. As per 31 December 2018, several invoices
relating to the refinancing process were outstanding, resulting in a higher balance compared to the current
year.

payable relating to the Senior Facility Agreement and Senior Secured Note of EUR 14,99 million.

Furthermore, other liabilities as per 31 December 2019 increased as a result of, among others, debt
towards former shareholders of acquired entities (EUR 1,65 million), the transition fee
(transitievergoeding) for the ‘‘Wet arbeidsmarkt in Balans’’ in the Netherlands (EUR 0,90 million) and debt
towards current shareholders (EUR 1,10 million). The remaining amount is mainly related to income

The earn-outs are based on final calculations of the purchase price which might deviate from expected
results as these are based on estimated amounts (such as future Earnings Before Interest, Tax,
Depreciation and Amortization). These relate to business combinations done during the previous years.
Refer to note 3.1 for more information.

The revaluation of shares in 2018 resulted from the acquiring of control over the TEC Group and
Zaquensis Group for which HOHR remeasured the previously held interest at fair value and recognized
the resultant gain in profit for an amount of EUR 24,30 million.

During 2018 it was decided to transfer the ratchet payable towards Abylsen from HOHR to the
shareholders of HOHR, resulting in a reversal of the provision of EUR 6,62 million.

**23 Cost of services**

Cost of services comprises expenses directly attributable to revenue. These costs mainly include expenses

**24 Selling expenses (Continued)**

The increased depreciations are mainly resulting from the increased depreciation charges on the
acquisition-related intangible assets on the one hand and from the impact of the IFRS16 lease standard
putting (almost) all leases on balance sheet (refer to note 2.2). The impact of the IFRS16 lease standard on
the depreciation charges is mostly compensated by a decrease in the rent of the cars and buildings,
included in the ‘services’.

**34 Events after the reporting date**

In late 2019, an epidemy of a virus called Covid19 started in Wuhan (China). The virus has expanded
worldwide and has highly impacted the world population health and the world economy. In early March
2020, the first signs that the epidemy has arrived in Europe started to be evident. Since then, all
Governments have taken very strict measures to prevent the epidemy to spread further. These measures
include social distancing, country wide quarantines, closing of non- essential business, and many alike. As a
consequence, since mid-March 2020 the world economy has come to a stop and also the company’s key
markets, producing a great harm to HOHR activity. Governments have approved very strong support
measures for businesses and individuals, mainly focused in helping to adapt the workforce to the new
reality, provide liquidity to companies, (by providing direct financing, guarantees to be used in front of
financial institutions and delaying the payment of certain taxes) . Even still in early stages of the pandemic
crisis the economic consequences of the decisions required to stop the spread of the virus are and will
heavily impact 2020 performance of HOHR. The final outcome of the crisis is not predictable, as the
depth, duration, and recovery are as of today impossible to predict.

The starting position in terms of liquidity and the flexibility of the cost structure of HOHR, the support of
HOHR Board of Directors, the full commitment of all managers and employees provide a strong support
to believe that HOHR will go through this crisis, and will be ready after to restart its activity and be able to
recover the pre-crisis situation.

**34 Events after the reporting date (Continued)**

As a consequence of the Covid19 crisis, EUR 95,00 million has been drawn from the undrawn borrowing
facilities after year-end. The Group has on top of that a strong cash position.

The Board confirms that, based on the information currently available and early signs of slow start up of
the economic activities again in the coming weeks on top of the cash balance as per 17 April 2020 of
EUR 288,96 million (including the EUR 95,00 million drawn facility) the needs of the group in the near
term are covered. These facts also provide comfort about meeting the Group’s financial obligations for a
period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.

As per year-end 2019, Covid19 does not have an effect on the financial position of the Group.

The Group, via its subsidiary Continu, has acquired 100% of the shares in Techmatch as per 23 January
2020. Techmatch is an independent engineering staffing specialist, specialized in mechanical engineering,
process engineering and electrical engineering. The consideration paid for acquiring 100% of the shares
amounts to EUR 6.75 million (excluding earn-out).

**CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**
**(ANNUAL REPORT) TO THE**
**GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS**
**OF MAY 20, 2020**

Dear shareholders,

In execution of the article 3:32 of the Company Code, we are honoured to present to you our report with
respect to our management and the business of the group during the accounting year ended December 31,
2019.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group, that we present to you, have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted within the European Union.

House of HR NV (‘‘HOHR’’) has done 4 acquisitions during 2019: Pharmacos per 2 April 2019 and
Mykelson per 3 April 2019, both active in France in the Engineering Consulting segment, Eurojob per
21 October 2019 (Specialized staffing segment) and ETA per 24 October 2019 (Engineering & Consulting
Segment). The result of these acquisitions has been included in the consolidation as from acquisition date.

The above mentioned acquisition, and the acquisitions done in 2018 (MT&V, Eurotech, Pharma Insight,
Hardt, PensioenPerspectief, ITDS, Legalia, Schollmeyer & Steidl GmbH, Weiderer GmbH, VNOM)
together with acquiring control over Zaquensis mid-2018, impact the comparability of the 2019 figures to
2018 figures.

Furthermore, the new IFRS16 Lease standard, that has been applied as from January 1, 2019, has a
significant impact on the presentation of the balance sheet. Assets and Liabilities has been restated,
including the impact of the new standard. As a result, Property Plant and Equipment and Other
(non)current liabilities have increased by EUR 68,56 million. In the P&L there is mainly a movement
between operating rent and depreciation charges, with limited impact on the net result (+EUR 1,36
million).

**1.** **Overview of the evolution of the consolidated results of the company**

**_General Business update 2019 vs 2018_**

HOHR completed 4 transactions along 2019, but M&A activity slowed down in the second half of the year,
as the Group stopped some of the files it was working on as no common ground for pursuing the deals was
reached. Consequently, the company was able to accumulate a great amount of cash (in excess of EUR 140
million) at year end December.

With respect to the sales evolution, the profile of 2019 on a monthly basis had 2 very different periods. The
first 6 months of 2019 continued with a very strong performance in all markets except in Germany, as a
continuation of 2018 sales trend. In the second half of the year, we experienced a slowdown in sales, mainly
driven by the lack of candidates available in the market, mixed with a slowdown of orders by our clients in
some markets. When candidates where found, such as Covebo in Poland, Accent in Belgium with the
Accent Foreign branches, and Zaquensis with the new Zaquensis International Recruitment program, the
growth continued to be strong and beating the markets, although at lower rate than in the first half of 2019.
Germany activity was still impacted by the AUG reform, mainly at Timepartner. Zaquensis was able to
return to sales growth in Q4-2019 compared to the same quarter of last year.

Gross margin for 2019 evolved nicely, driven by the capacity of HOHR to increase prices due to candidate
scarcity, and a mix in the overall sales, with higher weight of Engineering consulting and Specialized
staffing (with higher gross margin %) compared to General Staffing.

Revenue, Cost of Services, Selling Expenses and Other General and Administrative expenses are heavily
impacted by the acquisitions done in the current year and the previous year. Overall gross profit over
revenue has remained stable at 25,9% compared to 25,5% last year. Operating expenses over revenue have
slightly increased from 18,8% to 19,8%.

Other gains and losses related in 2018 for the main part to the revaluation of the shares when acquiring
control over the TEC and Zaquensis Group.

During 2019 HOHR has done a refinancing, resulting in a Senior Facility Agreement of EUR 550,00
million and Senior Secured Notes of EUR 370,00 million EUR. Refinancing expenses have been
capitalized and are being depreciated over the lifetime of the loan, which are accounted for as finance
costs, impacting the finances expense in 2019 compared to 2018. Furthermore, a derivative financial asset
has been recognized on the balance sheet of EUR 7,57 million relating to an early payment option. Initial
value of the derivative at refinancing amounted to EUR 4,08 million, with changes in fair value being
recorded as financial income/expense.

Tax expenses amount to 52,9% of profit before tax, compared to 28,3% last year. These are heavily
impacted by tax losses resulting, among other, from the refinancing done as mentioned above.

During 2019, several transactions have occurred impacting equity:

  - Contribution in cash (+EUR 0,25 million)

  - Roll-over Vialegis and Redmore (+EUR 24,60 million)

  - Capital decrease (-EUR 287,41 million)

  - Capital increase (+EUR 15,69 million)

Non-controlling interests have decreased mainly as a result of the roll-over of Vialegis and Redmore.

Deferred income tax liabilities are mainly related to deferred taxes on the Purchase Price Allocations done
and on the fair value adjustment of the borrowings. These are depreciated over the lifetime of the trade
name/customer relationship and the lifetime of the loan, respectively.

Borrowings have increased by EUR 300,83 million as a result of the refinancing done during the year, cf.
supra.

Other current liabilities are heavily impacted by the new IFRS16 standard, resulting in a lease liability of
EUR 29,97 million at 31 December 2019.

**2.** **Post balance sheet events**

In late 2019, an epidemy of a virus called Covid19 started in Wuhan (China) . The virus has expanded
worldwide and has highly impacted the world population health and the world economy. In early March
2020, the first signs that the epidemy has arrived in Europe started to be evident. Since then, all
Governments have taken very strict measures to prevent the epidemy to spread further. These measures
include social distancing, country wide quarantines, closing of non-essential business, and many alike.
Consequently, since mid-March 2020 the world economy has come to a stop and also the company’s key

markets, producing a great harm to HOHR activity. Governments have approved very strong support
measures for businesses and individuals, mainly focused in helping to adapt the workforce to the new
reality, provide liquidity to companies, (by providing direct financing, guarantees to be used in front of
financial institutions and delaying the payment of certain taxes). Even still in early stages of the pandemic
crisis the economic consequences of the decisions required to stop the spread of the virus are and will
heavily impact 2020 performance of HOHR. The final outcome of the crisis is not predictable, as the
depth, duration, and recovery are as of today impossible to predict.

The starting position in terms of liquidity and the flexibility of the cost structure of HOHR, the support of
HOHR Board of Directors, the full commitment of all managers and employees provide a strong support
to believe that HOHR will go through this crisis, and will be ready after to restart its activity and be able to
recover the pre-crisis situation.

Because of the Covid19 crisis, EUR 95,00 million has been drawn from the undrawn borrowing facilities
after year-end. The Group has on top of that a strong cash position.

The Board confirms that, based on the information currently available and early signs of slow start up of
the economic activities again in the coming weeks on top of the cash balance as per 17 April 2020 of
EUR 288,96 million (including the EUR 95,00 million drawn facility) the needs of the group in the near
term are covered. These facts also provide comfort about meeting the Group’s financial obligations for a
period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.

As per year-end 2019, Covid19 does not have an effect on the financial position of the Group.

The Group, via its subsidiary Continu, has acquired 100% of the shares in Techmatch as per 23 January
2020. Techmatch is an independent engineering staffing specialist, specialized in mechanical engineering,
process engineering and electrical engineering. The consideration paid for acquiring 100% of the shares
amounts to EUR 6.75 million (excluding earn-out).

**3.** **Risk and uncertainties**

Except for Covid19 (cf. supra), there are no other risks or uncertainties.

**4.** **Information on the circumstances with a potential significant effect on the future evolution of the**
**company**

We foresee no other elements with a potential significant effect on the future evolution of the company.

**5.** **Research and development**

In the field of research and development, an R&D department has been established further in our
company, supporting the development of specific software tools for the interim labour industry.

**6.** **Information with respect to the use of financial instruments by the company, as far as considered**
**meaningful**

Except for the derivative financial instrument (early payment option) mentioned above, there are no
meaningful financial instruments held by the Company as per 31 December 2019.

**STATUTORY AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING OF HOUSE**
**OF HR NV ON THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER**
**2019**

We present to you our statutory auditor’s report in the context of our statutory audit of the consolidated
accounts of House of HR NV (the ‘‘Company’’) and its subsidiaries (jointly ‘‘the Group’’). This report
includes our report on the consolidated accounts, as well as the other legal and regulatory requirements.
This forms part of an integrated whole and is indivisible.

We have been appointed as statutory auditor by the general meeting d.d. 20 June 2019, following the
proposal formulated by the board of directors. Our mandate will expire on the date of the general meeting
which will deliberate on the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2021. We have performed
the statutory audit of the Company’s consolidated accounts for 4 consecutive years.

**Report on the consolidated accounts**

**_Unqualified opinion_**

We have performed the statutory audit of the Group’s consolidated accounts, which comprise the
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2019, the consolidated income statement for the period then
ended and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in
equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information, and which is characterised by a consolidated balance sheet total of EUR 1.606.873.166 and a
net profit of the period of EUR 33.379.775.

In our opinion, the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the Group’s net equity and
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2019, and of its consolidated financial performance and its
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in
Belgium.

**_Basis for unqualified opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in
Belgium. Furthermore, we have applied the International Standards on Auditing as approved by the
IAASB which are applicable to the year-end and which are not yet approved at the national level. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘‘Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the
_audit of the consolidated accounts’’ section of our report. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in_
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated accounts in
Belgium, including the requirements related to independence.

We have obtained from the board of directors and Company officials the explanations and information
necessary for performing our audit.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**_Emphasis of Matter—subsequent events_**

As far as the outbreak of COVID 19 is concerned, we draw your attention to point 2 of the directors’
report (‘‘Post balance sheet events’’) and Note 34 (‘‘Events after the reporting date’’) of the consolidated
accounts in which the board of directors expresses their view that, although the consequences thereof may
have a significant impact on the Group’s operations in 2020, such consequences do not have a material
impact on the Group’s financial position for the year ended 31 December 2019. Our opinion is not
qualified in respect of this matter.

**Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated accounts**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated accounts that give a true and fair
view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium, and for such internal control as the
board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated accounts that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate the Group or
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these consolidated accounts.

In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to the
audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium. A statutory audit does not provide any assurance as to the
Group’s future viability nor as to the efficiency or effectiveness of the board of directors’ current or future
business management at group level.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control;

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors;

F-128


-----

###### pwc

1JUL201915031167

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our statutory auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
Group to cease to continue as a going concern;

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated accounts, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events
in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

**Other legal and regulatory requirements**

**_Responsibilities of the board of directors_**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the directors’ report on the
consolidated accounts.

**_Statutory auditor’s responsibilities_**

In the context of our mandate and in accordance with the Belgian standard which is complementary to the
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium, our responsibility is to verify, in all
material respects, the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts and to report on this matter.

**_Aspects related to the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts_**

In our opinion, after having performed specific procedures in relation to the directors’ report on the
consolidated accounts, this directors’ report is consistent with the consolidated accounts for the year under
audit and is prepared in accordance with article 3:32 of the Companies’ and Associations’ Code.

In the context of our audit of the consolidated accounts, we are also responsible for considering, in
particular based on the knowledge acquired resulting from the audit, whether the directors’ report is
materially misstated or contains information which is inadequately disclosed or otherwise misleading. In
light of the procedures we have performed, there are no material misstatements we have to report to you.

**_Statement related to independence_**

- Our registered audit firm and our network did not provide services which are incompatible with the
statutory audit of the consolidated accounts, and our registered audit firm remained independent of
the Group in the course of our mandate.

and itemized in the notes to the consolidated accounts.

the statutory audit of the consolidated accounts of House of HR NV for 3 consecutive years.

**Report on the consolidated accounts**

**Unqualified opinion**

We have performed the statutory audit of the Group’s consolidated accounts, which comprise the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018, the consolidated statement of profit
or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and
which is characterised by a consolidated statement of financial position (consolidated balance sheet) total
of EUR’000 1.466.998 and a profit for the year of EUR’000 80.083.

In our opinion, the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the Group’s net equity and
consolidated financial position as at 31 December 2018, and of its consolidated financial performance and
its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in

in 2012 and became the majority shareholder in 2014 following the acquisition of Mr. Philip Cracco’s
shares.

HOHR is a leading HR service provider focusing on three specific types of staffing:

- **General staffing: General temporary agencies delivering candidates to clients in a fast and flexible way,**
whenever they are shorthanded.

- **Specialized staffing: Specialized staffing companies in certain sectors including construction, retail,**
finance and many other sectors.

- **Engineering & consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving sectors**
like energy, pharmaceuticals, technology etc. The Group also assists clients with the search and
selection of the right candidate, interim management or secondment.

The external growth strategy as developed by management of HOHR resulted in a number of important
acquisitions that were successfully completed by the Group over the last years (Refer to the Note 4 for
more information). These acquisitions increased the Group’s foothold in its core sector of delivering
general staff on a temporary basis to customers as well as in companies active in niche sectors such as legal
and financial services delivering highly-ranged professionals to customers. Clients are both SMEs and large
corporations, occupying leading positions in all kind of industries.

The consolidated financial statements of HOHR include the Company and its subsidiaries (all together
‘‘the Group’’).

The Group currently has a network of over 500 offices in Europe, and is active in Belgium, Germany, the
Netherlands, France and Switzerland, but also present in Spain, Portugal, Romania, Luxembourg and
Poland.

It now employs almost 2.900 people and is providing jobs to 45.000 people each day via its brands:

- **General staffing: TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS;**

- **Specialized staffing: Accent, Covebo**

- **Engineering & consulting: Abylsen, Continu, Redmore, TEC and Vialegis.**

All recent acquisitions substantially contribute to the overall performance of the Group.

The Group structure as in place as per 31 December 2018 is filed in Note 4.

All subsidiaries held directly or indirectly by the Group maintain their accounting records and prepare
statutory financial statements in accordance with local accounting regulations.

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies**

This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these
consolidated financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented,
unless otherwise stated.

**2.1 Basis of preparation**

**_(i)_** **_Compliance with IFRS_**

These audited consolidated non-statutory financial statements are comprised of the consolidated
statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of financial performance, the consolidated

F-145

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

statement of other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the
consolidated statement of cash flows for the period ended 31 December 2018 and the related notes.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
and adopted within the European Union.

**_(ii) Historical cost convention_**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the
following:

- Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

- Derivative financial instruments, debt and equity financial assets and contingent consideration that
have been measured at fair value;

- Cash-settled option plans and ratchets for which the liability is measured at fair value;

- Other long-term employee benefits, for which the liability is measured in accordance with the
projected unit-credit method; and

- the vendor loan notes and non-convertible bond are initially measured at fair value, by discounting the
future cash flows (principal and interest) at the market interest rate.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in
Note 6.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro (EUR) and all values are presented in EUR,
except when otherwise indicated.

**2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**

The Group’s financial statements as per 31 December 2018 are the first financial statements that are
prepared in accordance with IFRS. Refer to Note 3 for more information.

**_(i)_** **_New and amended standards adopted by the Group_**

Below an overview is filed of the impact on the Group of IFRS standards that became applicable for the
first time as from 1 January 2018. The Group has applied these standards retrospectively for all periods
presented in these financial statements. The nature and effect of adopting these new accounting standards
is described below.

- **_IFRS 9—Financial instruments:_**

IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ replaces IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
This standard, which covers financial instruments on both the asset as well as the liability side, describes
the criteria for recognition, classification and derecognition of such instruments, in addition to the allowed
measurement methods.

The nature of these adjustments is described below:

a) Classification and measurement:

Under IFRS 9, debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, amortized
cost, or fair value through OCI. The classification is based on two criteria: The Group’s business model for
managing the assets; and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of

F-146

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding. The assessment of the Group’s business model
was made as of the date of transition of the Group to IFRS, i.e. 1 January 2016. The assessment of whether
contractual cash flows on debt instruments are solely comprised of principal and interest was made based
on the facts and circumstances as at the initial recognition of the assets.

The classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9, however, did not have a significant impact on
the Group.

b) Impairment:

IFRS 9 requires the Group to recognize an allowance for ECLs for all debt instruments not held at fair
value through profit or loss and contract assets.

Upon the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group recognized additional impairment on the Group’s outstanding
trade receivables of EUR 0.6 million per 1 January 2016 (31 December 2016: EUR 0.2 million,
31 December 2017: EUR 0.6 million). The statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018 was
adjusted, resulting in decreases in trade receivables and retained earnings of EUR 0.5 million.

- **_IFRS 15—Revenue from contracts with customers:_**

IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related Interpretations and it
applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising from contracts with its customers. IFRS 15
establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and requires
revenue to be recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. IFRS 15 requires entities to exercise
judgement, taking into consideration all the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of
the model to contracts with their customers. The standard also specifies the accounting for the incremental
costs of obtaining a contract and the costs directly related to fulfilling a contract. In addition, the standard
requires extensive disclosures.

The Group has identified one performance obligation within the vast majority of its customer contracts,
i.e. the delivery of services for a predefined period of time by one or more temping staff or consultants.
The Group recognizes mainly revenue over time when the service is delivered towards its customers.

Measuring revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 did not have a significant impact for the Group as the
Group currently recognizes revenue over time when the service is being delivered. This revenue
recognition pattern is in line with paragraph 35a of IFRS 15 as the customer simultaneously receives and
consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the staff of the Group is performing the
services.

The Group offers volume rebates to a limited number of customers. The Group applies the ‘most likely
amount method’ for contracts with a single volume threshold and the ‘expected value method’ for contracts
with more than one volume threshold.

The Group does not offer warranties, customer loyalty point programs or any material financing
component to its customers.

IFRS 15 has been applied retrospectively for the financial years 2016 and 2017. The impact of transition to
IFRS 15 has been considered as immaterial on the total financial statements.

- **_Other new standards, amendments and interpretations:_**

Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2018, but do not have an impact
on the consolidated financial statements of the Group:

- IFRIC Interpretation 22—Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Considerations

- Amendments to IAS 40—Transfers of Investment Property;

- Amendments to IFRS 2—Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions;

- Annual improvements 2014-2016—IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting

and joint ventures.

The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but
are not yet effective.

**_(ii) New and amended standards not yet adopted by the Group_**

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for
31 December 2018 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s
assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.

IFRS 16 Leases

IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. It will result in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet
by lessees, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an
asset (the right to use asset) and a financial liability, measured as the net present value of future lease
payments, are recognized. Short-term leases and low-value leases are exempted.

The Group has set up a project team which has reviewed all the Group’s leasing arrangements over the last
year (2018) in light of the new lease accounting rules in IFRS 16. The standard will affect primarily the
accounting for the Group’s operating leases.

The Group’s main leased items consist of company cars, regional headquarters, branches and parking
places as well as housing accommodation for some of its temporary staff. The Group also leases printing
and IT equipment which are classified as low value assets and thus exempted.

As at the reporting date, the Group has several non-cancellable operating lease commitments. The Group
expects to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of approximately EUR 56 million. The Group
expects that the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization will improve by approximately
EUR 28 million. Operating cash flows will increase, and financing cash flows will decrease as repayment of
the principal portion of the lease liabilities will be classified as cash flows from financing activities.

The Group also acts as a sublessor of housing accommodation. These contracts however are exempted for
qualification as a finance lease under IFRS 16 considering that these relate to short term contracts
(< 12 months).

The remaining Group’s activities as a lessor are not material and hence the Group does not expect any
significant impact on the financial statements. However, some additional disclosures will be required as
from next year.

The Group will apply the standard from its mandatory adoption date of 1 January 2019. The Group
intends to apply the simplified transition approach and will therefore not restate comparative amounts for
the year prior to first adoption.

Other new standards, amendments and interpretations

Group’s management preliminary assessment revealed that the following standards and amendments to
standards that have been endorsed within the European Union and that are not yet applicable as per the
first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2018 should not have a material impact for the Group:

- **Amendments to IFRS 9, ‘Prepayment features with negative compensation’ (effective 1 January 2019**
with the EU).

- **IFRIC 23, ‘Uncertainty over income tax treatments’ (effective 1 January 2019).**

- **Amendments to IAS 28, ‘Long term interests in associates and joint ventures’ (effective 1 January 2019).**

F-148

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

- **Amendments to IAS 19, ‘Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement’ (effective 1 January 2019).**

- **Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 cycle, applicable as of 1 January 2019 and**
containing changes to IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 12
Income Taxes and IAS 23 Borrowing Costs.

Standards and amendments to standards that have not yet been endorsed within the European Union and
that are not yet applicable as per the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2018:

- **IFRS 17 ‘Insurance contracts’ (effective 1 January 2021).**

- **Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective 1 January**
2020).

- **Amendments to the guidance of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, that revises the definition of a business**
(effective 1 January 2020).

- **Amendments to the definition of material in IAS 1 and IAS 8 (effective 1 January 2020).**

**2.3 Principles of consolidation and equity accounting**

**_(i)_** **_Subsidiaries_**

The consolidated non-statutory financial information includes the financial statements of entities over
which the Group exercises control. The Group controls an entity (including structured entities) when the
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity to decide over relevant activities. The
existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered
when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the
date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that
control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. Refer to Note 4.1 for
more information.

Inter-company transactions, balances, income and unrealized gains on transactions between Group
companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated
statement of financial position, statement of financial performance and statement of other comprehensive
income as well as the statement of changes in equity.

**_(ii) Joint arrangements_**

A joint arrangement operates in the same way as other entities, except that a contractual arrangement
between the Group and other ventures establishes joint control over the economic activity of the entity.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when
decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Under
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or
joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather
than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.

- Joint operations

The Group recognizes its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations
and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been
incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings. The Group does not have any
material joint operation as per 31 December 2018.

F-149


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

- Joint ventures

Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see below), after initially being
recognized at cost in the consolidated statement of financial position.

- Equity method

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and adjusted
thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit
or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other
comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognized
as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the
entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses,
unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.

Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to
the extent of the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity
accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by
the Group.

The Group’s investment in joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition.

The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the
policy described in Note 2.11.

**_(iii) Changes in ownership interests_**

The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as
transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment
between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative
interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling
interests and any consideration paid or received is recognized in a separate reserve within equity
attributable to owners of the Group.

When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control,
joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with
the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying
amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture
or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in
respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or
liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are
reclassified to profit or loss.

If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

**2.4 Foreign currency translation**

**_(i)_** **_Functional and presentation currency_**

Items included in the financial statements of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated
non-statutory financial statements are presented in euro (EUR), which is the Group’s functional and
presentation currency.

F-150


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**_(ii) Transactions and balances_**

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement
of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies, are recognized in the income statement, except when deferred in other
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. They are deferred in equity if they relate to
qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net
investment in a foreign operation.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in
the income statement within ‘Finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are
presented in the income statement within ‘Other gains/(losses), net’.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value
through profit or loss, are recognized as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on
non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as available-for-sale, are included in the fair value
reserve in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value
gain or loss.

**_(iii) Group companies_**

The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of
that balance sheet

- income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive income are
translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative
effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and all resulting exchange
differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign
entities, and of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are
recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold or any borrowings forming
part of the net investment are repaid, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss,
as part of the gain or loss on sale.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

**2.5 Business combinations**

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of
whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the:

- fair values of the assets transferred;

- liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;

- equity interests issued by the Group;

- fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and

- fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

F-151


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are,
with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition
basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net
identifiable assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

The excess of the:

- consideration transferred;

- amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and

- acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair value of
the net identifiable assets acquired

is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the
business acquired, the difference is recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are
discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s
incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an
independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a
financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit
or loss.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains
or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.

In case of a combination of entities which are ultimately controlled by the Group before and after the
combination, management has chosen to apply predecessor accounting instead of the acquisition method
of accounting. The assets or liabilities of these entities are not restated to their fair value, instead the
Group incorporates the predecessor carrying values. These are generally the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities of the acquired entities. As the combining entities are looked at from the perspective of a
transfer made by the controlling party, no new goodwill arises from the combination, and any difference
between price paid and the carrying amount of net assets exchanged is recorded as a separate reserve in
equity.

**2.6 Goodwill**

Goodwill is measured as described in Note 4 on the business combinations and in Note 8 after initial
recognition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is shown separately in the statement of financial
position. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in equity accounted for
investments and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance.

Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment
losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the
entity sold.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is
made to those cash-generating units or Groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from
the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or Groups of units are identified at the
lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating
segments.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**2.7 Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recognized when the cost of an asset can be reliably measured and it is probable that
the entity will obtain future economic benefits from the asset over a period extending beyond the current
fiscal year.

At initial measurement, intangible assets are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price,
including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly attributable costs of preparing
the asset for its intended use.

**_(i)_** **_Trademark and customer relationship contracts_**

Separately acquired trademarks are shown at historical cost. Trademarks, licenses and customer
relationship contracts acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition
date. They have a finite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
impairment losses.

**_(ii) Acquired computer software licenses_**

Externally acquired software licenses are stated at historical costs and amortized over its estimated useful
life.

**_(iii) Internally developed software_**

Costs associated with maintaining software programs are recognized as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Group are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria
are met:

- it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use

- management intends to complete the software and use or sell it

- there is an ability to use or sell the software

- it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
software are available, and

- the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalized as part of the software include employee costs and an
appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

Development costs are amortized from the point at which the asset is ready for use.

Research expenditure and development expenditure that do not meet the criteria indicated above are
recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not
recognized as an asset in a subsequent period.

**_(iv) Amortization methods and periods of intangible assets_**

The Group amortizes intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the
following periods:

**Intangible assets** **Amortization method** **Amortization periods**

Trademarks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization Between 11 and 20 years
Customer relationships . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization Between 7 and 12 years
Internally generated software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization 3 to 5 years
Acquired computer software licenses . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization 1 to 5 years
Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line amortization 3 to 5 years

F-153

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**2.8 Property, plant and equipment**

All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost may also include transfers
from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property,
plant and equipment.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component
accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenances are
charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.

The Group depreciates PP&E assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the
following periods:

**Property, plant and equipment** **Depreciation method** **Depreciation periods**

Freehold land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Not depreciated Not depreciated
Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line depreciation 35 years
Plant, machinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line depreciation 5 years
Vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line depreciation 5 years
Furniture and office equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line depreciation 5 years
Leased plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line depreciation 5 years or shorter if
lease term is shorter
Other tangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line depreciation 5 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting period.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Refer to impairment of assets for more
information (note 2.11).

PPE is derecognized either on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
disposal.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are
included in profit or loss. When revalued assets are sold, it is Group policy to transfer any amounts
included in other reserves in respect of those assets to retained earnings.

**2.9 Leases**

The Group leases mainly company cars, buildings and IT equipment.

The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the
arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfillment of the
arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use
the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in the arrangement.

**_(i)_** **_The Group is acting as a lessee_**

Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the lease’s inception
at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The
corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other short-term and long-term
payables. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is
charged to the profit or loss over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under
finance leases is depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the

lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease
term.

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the
Group as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of
the lease.

**_(ii) The Group is acting as a lessor_**

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from
the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on their nature.

**2.10 Inventories**

The Group measures its inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs of purchased
inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated
costs necessary to make the sale.

**2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets**

Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are
tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they
might be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purpose of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows
which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating
units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible
reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

**2.12 Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on
hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, and other short-term, highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

**2.13 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations**

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is
considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial
assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under insurance
contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.

An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group)
to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell
of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized.
A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group)
is recognized at the date of derecognition.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortized
while they are classified as held for sale. Interests and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a
disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognized.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale
are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a
disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of
financial position.

A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for
sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a
single coordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary
acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately
in the statement of profit or loss.

**2.14 Financial assets**

**_(i)_** **_Classification_**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss), and

- those to be measured at amortized cost.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the
contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For
investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has
made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets
changes.

**_(ii) Recognition and derecognition_**

Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on trade-date, the date on which the
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive
cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

**_(iii) Measurement_**

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial
asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in
profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether
their cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.

- Debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the
asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the
Group classifies its debt instruments:

- Amortized cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows
represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost. Interest income

F-156


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any
gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss and presented in other
gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as a
separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial
assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured
at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of
impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are
recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss
previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognized in other gains/
(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective
interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and
impairment expenses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A
gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognized in profit or loss
and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.

- Equity instruments

The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management
has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent
reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment.
Dividends from such investments continue to be recognized in profit or loss as other income when the
Group’s right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognized in other gains/(losses) in the statement
of profit or loss as applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments
measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

**_(iv) Impairment_**

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated with its debt instruments
carried at amortized cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there
has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables, see Note 12 for further
details.

**_(v) Derivatives_**

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for
subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument,
and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group did not designate certain derivatives as hedge
instruments.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining
maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the
remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current
asset or liability.

Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognized immediately in profit or loss and are included in other gains/(losses).

As regards embedded derivatives, the Group assesses whether the derivative is closely related to the host
instrument and accounted for separately or not.

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**2.15 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities**

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis
or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be
contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of
default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.

**2.16 Compound financial instruments**

Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible notes that can be converted to
share capital, and the number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value.

The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognized initially at the fair value of a
similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognized
initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the
fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability
and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured
at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial
instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition except on conversion or expiry.

**2.17 Trade receivables and other receivables**

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for sales made in the ordinary course of business. Trade
receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method, less loss allowance. See note 12 for further information about the Group’s
accounting for trade receivables and for a description of the Group’s impairment policies.

If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented
as non-current assets.

The contract assets related to contracts with customers are classified as other receivables.

**2.18 Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Mandatorily redeemable preference shares are classified as
liabilities.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of
tax, from the proceeds.

Where any Group company purchases the company’s equity instruments, for example as the result of a
share buy-back or a share-based payment plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable
incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of House of HR
as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the
related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of House of HR.

**2.19 Dividends**

A liability is recognized for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorized and no
longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the
end of the reporting period.

**2.20 Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are
subsequently carried at amortized cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and

F-158


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the
extent that it is probable that some or all the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred
until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all the
facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over
the period of the facility to which it relates.

The fair value of the liability portion of a convertible bond is determined using a market interest rate for
an equivalent non-convertible bond. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortized cost basis until
extinguishment on conversion or maturity of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the
conversion option. This is recognized and included in shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects.

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is
discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that
has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash
assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss as other income or finance costs.

Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the entity issues equity instruments to a
creditor to extinguish all or part of the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognized in profit
or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the
fair value of the equity instruments issued.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

**2.21 Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the
end of the financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days
of recognition. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due
within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognized initially at their fair value and
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

**2.22 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets**

**_(i)_** **_Provisions_**

The Group recognizes provisions for legal claims or similar types of obligations when the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of Group management’s best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. Where there are a number of
similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by the
Group by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of
an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.

In case the Group expects a reimbursement from another party, the Group will recognize a separate asset
when and only when it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received. The amount recognized
for the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of the provision. In the statement of comprehensive
income, the expense relating to a provision may be presented net of the amount recognized for a
reimbursement.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**_(ii) Contingent liabilities and contingent assets_**

The Group does not recognize any contingent liabilities, instead contingent liabilities are disclosed, unless
the possibility of an outflow is remote. The Group discloses the inflow of economic benefits when it is
probable. Contingent assets are recognized when it is virtually certain that the economic benefits will flow
into the Group.

**2.23 Current and deferred income tax**

The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. Tax is recognized in the
statement of financial performance, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity, respectively.

The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income
based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.

**_(i)_** **_Current income tax_**

The current income tax charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
end of the reporting period in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures
operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes
provisions where appropriate based on amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

**_(ii) Deferred income tax_**

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of
goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or
liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws)
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to
apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to
utilize those temporary differences and losses.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognized for temporary differences between the carrying
amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the company is able to control the timing
of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax
assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends
either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognized in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**2.24 Employee benefits**

**_(i)_** **_Short-term obligations_**

The main employee benefits of the Group consist of short-term employee benefits for wages and salaries,
including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be settled
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees rendered the related service.
These liabilities are recognized in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and
are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are
presented as current employee benefit obligations in the statement of financial position.

**_(ii) Pension benefits_**

- Defined contribution plans

The Group has defined contribution plans as well as disability benefits in certain countries in which it
operates whereby contributions by the Group are funded through payments to independent entities. For
these schemes, the Group’s obligation is limited to the payment of these annual contributions.

The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions
are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is
available.

Because of the Belgian legislation applicable to the second pillar pension plans (the so-called ‘‘Law
Vandenbroucke’’), all Belgian pension plans that are structured as defined contribution plans are
considered defined benefit plans under IFRS. Because of this minimum guaranteed return, the employer is
exposed to a financial risk since further contributions could be required if the return on the assets is not
sufficient to reach the minimum benefits to be paid. The Company has plans that are financed through
insurance contracts. The projected unit credit method has been used as the actuarial technique to measure
the defined benefit obligation. The related assumptions, the defined benefit obligation and related plan
assets are further disclosed in Note 18.

- Defined benefit plans

The Group does not offer defined benefit plans to its staff. For the specific situation on the Belgian
pension plans, we refer to above.

**_(iii) Other long-term employee benefits_**

Some Group entities provide jubilee benefits rewarding employees for long years of service. The liability
recognized in the statement of financial position is the present value of the obligation at the reporting date.
The remeasurements have been recognized in the statement of financial performance in full.

The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless of
when the actual settlement is expected to occur.

**_(iv) Termination benefits_**

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal
retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.

The Group recognizes termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates:

- when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and

- when the entity recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the
payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the
termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to
present value.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**2.25 Share-based payments**

Share-based compensation benefits are provided to key managers via the ‘‘We are One’’ option plan and
the long-term incentive plan (LTIP). Further, different cash-settled ‘Ratchet’ schemes have been created to
incentivize senior management of the local subsidiaries.

Apart from the LTIP plan, all these plans are cash-settled plans as the beneficiary has the possibility to
settle the share options received in cash at the fair value of the share option upon settlement. The LTIP
plan is classified as an equity-settled share-base payment plan.

A) Cash settled share-based payments

The fair value of options granted under the ‘‘We are One’’ employee option plan and the ‘Ratchet’
schemes are recognized over the vesting period as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding
increase in the liability. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the options/ratchets is measured initially
and remeasured at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date in order to determine the
corresponding employee benefit expense of the period.

B) Equity settled share-based payments

The fair value of the goods or services received is recognized with a corresponding increase in equity.

The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made
using an appropriate valuation model.

A share-based payment award generally vests upon meeting specified conditions. Vesting conditions are
either:

- Service conditions, which require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service during
which the services are provided to the entity; or

- Performance conditions, which requires the counterparty to complete a specified period of service
(i.e., a service condition) and involves specified performance targets to be met while the counterparty
is rendering the required service

A performance condition is further defined as either a market condition or a non-market condition. A
market condition is a performance condition (i.e., requires specified targets to be met) and the
performance conditions are related to the market price (or value) of the entity’s equity instruments, such
as: attaining a specified share price or achieving a specified target that is based on the market price (or
value) of the entity’s equity instruments relative to an index of market prices of equity instruments of other
entities. A condition linked to a purely internal financial performance measure, such as profit or earnings
per share, is not a market condition. Such measures will affect the share price, but are not directly linked to
it, and hence are not market conditions. For a market condition to be treated as a performance vesting
condition rather than a non-vesting condition, there must also be an implicit or explicit service condition.

Under IFRS 2, the nature of the condition (i.e., vesting or non-vesting, service, performance, market or
non-market) affects the timing of when the expense is recognized and, in some cases, the measurement of
the expense. In addition, if a condition is not met, whether the entity may reverse the previously recognized
compensation expense depends on the nature of the condition that was not met. Therefore, the
classification of a condition is a critical step in accounting for share-based payment transactions. Market
conditions are only considered when estimating the fair value of the award at the grant date. Non-market
vesting conditions are not considered when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the
grant date. Instead, these vesting conditions are considered by adjusting the number of equity instruments
included in the measurement of the transaction amount so as to reflect the number of awards that are
expected to vest. Such non-market vesting conditions include a service condition.

**2.26 Revenue recognition**

The Group mainly generates revenue from offering temporary staffing solutions to its customers. The
duration of these temporary staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two

F-162


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

years. The Group mainly offers temporary staffing solutions in the following industries: construction
industry, manufacturing industry, logistics industry, sales and finance industry.

The Group also provides solutions to customers active in larger project-oriented businesses (such as the
telecom or the construction industry) where apart from staffing also specific deliverables have to be
provided for. Projects may take one week up to two to three months.

The Group has identified one performance obligation within the vast majority of its customer contracts,
i.e. the delivery of services for a predefined period of time by one or more temping staff or consultants.
Revenue from temporary staffing solutions is traditionally negotiated and invoiced to customers using an
hourly rate (i.e. the transaction price). Temporary workers charge all their worked hours on project codes
which are then accumulated on a weekly or monthly basis and billed to customers. Revenue from
temporary staffing solutions is recognized over time upon rendering the services.

Revenues related to services rendered in the project business are recognized upon the performance of the
service under contract by comparing the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a
proportion of the total services to be provided. This is determined based on the actual costs incurred as
compared to the total expected costs to incur to successfully complete the project.

The Group recognizes contract assets if the Group has a right to payment for goods and services already
transferred to a customer if that right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of
time. These contract assets are recognized as part of the other receivables.

Contract fulfilment costs related to this project business are capitalized and amortized on a systematic
basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods and services to which these assets relate.

Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change.
Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the
period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.

Customers are invoiced on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis and the consideration is payable when
invoiced.

The Group offers volume rebates to a limited number of customers. The Group applies the ‘most likely
amount method’ for contracts with a single volume threshold and the ‘expected value method’ for contracts
with more than one volume threshold.

The Group has not identified any material amounts for contract assets or contract liabilities.

The Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or
services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.

For sales arrangements where the Group acts as a principal in the transaction and has the principal risk
and rewards of ownership, including amongst others, the obligation to deliver the services and the credit
risk, revenue is reported gross by the Group. Under arrangements where the Group acts as an agent,
revenue is reported on a net basis.

**2.27 Interest income**

Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired,
the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow
discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument and continues unwinding the discount as
interest income. Interest income on impaired loans and receivables is recognized using the original
effective interest rate.

**3 First time adoption of IFRS**

These consolidated financial statements, as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 are the first the
Group has prepared in accordance with IFRS. For periods up to and including the year ended
31 December 2017, the Group prepared its financial statements on an accrual basis in accordance with

F-163


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 First time adoption of IFRS (Continued)**

Belgian Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (‘‘Belgian GAAP’’) as defined in the Royal Decree of
30 January 2001, which is the predecessor GAAP.

Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements that comply with IFRS applicable as at
31 December 2018, together with the comparative period data for the years ended 31 December 2017 and
2016, as described in the summary of significant accounting policies. In preparing the financial statements,
the Group’s opening balance sheet was prepared as at 1 January 2016, the Group’s date of transition to
IFRS.

This note explains the relevant IFRS 1 exemptions that have been applied by the Group and the principal
adjustments made by the Group in converting its Belgian GAAP financial statements, including the
balance sheet as at 1 January 2016 and the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 as
well as the total comprehensive income as per 31 December 2017.

**3.1 Exemptions applied**

The general requirement of IFRS 1 is full retrospective application of all accounting standards effective at
the end of the Group’s first IFRS reporting period which is 31 December 2018 for the Group. The
cumulative impact of the IFRS adjustments on the opening balance sheet is recognized in retained
earnings at the transition date. However, IFRS 1 allows first-time adopters to apply certain exemptions
from the general restatement and remeasurement principles as foreseen under IFRS.

The IFRS 1 exemptions that have been applied by the Group are the following:

- **Business Combinations (IFRS 3): The Group completed several acquisitions prior to its transition date**
to IFRS. The Group, however, elected not to apply the requirements of IFRS 3 Business
Combinations to past business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS.

- **Cumulative translation differences (IAS 21): The Group elected not to comply with the requirements**
included in paragraph D12 of IFRS 1. Therefore, the Group decided to put to zero all the cumulative
translation differences for all foreign operations at the date of transition to IFRSs.

- **Revenue (IFRS 15): IFRS 1 allows first-time adopters to apply the transitional provisions foreseen in**
paragraph C5 of IFRS 15 (practical expedients). The Group decided to apply these practical
expedients as per 1 January 2016 and therefore the Group is not restating its revenue from contracts
with customers for completed contracts that begin and end within the same reporting period and
which are completed prior to 1 January 2016.

**3.2 Estimates**

The estimates at 1 January 2016 and all other reporting periods are consistent with those made for the
same dates in accordance with Belgian GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any differences in accounting
policies).

**3.3 Reconciliations between Belgian GAAP and IFRS**

The Groups transition date to IFRS is 1 January 2016. The first IFRS financial statements that will be filed
are these that have ended as per 31 December 2018. The Group provides below the following
reconciliations in accordance with paragraph 24 of IFRS 1:

- reconciliations of the Group’s equity reported in accordance with Belgian GAAP to its equity in
accordance with IFRSs for both of the following dates:

    - the date of transition to IFRS (i.e. 1 January 2016); and

    - the end of the latest period presented in the Group’s most recent annual financial statements
in accordance with Belgian GAAP (i.e. 31 December 2017).

- a reconciliation to the Group’s total comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS for the latest
period in the Group’s most recent annual financial statements. The starting point for that
reconciliation for the Group is the profit or loss under Belgian GAAP.

**_(i)_** **_Changes in the consolidation scope of the Group_**

THoHR II (renamed in 2018 into HOHR) has been created in December 2015. At that date the
consolidation of the Group in accordance with Belgian GAAP was made at the level of Accent Group and
therefore no consolidation was made at the level of HOHR.

The filed consolidated Belgian GAAP figures of Accent Group have been used in the table ‘Reconciliation
of Group equity at 1 January 2016’ as a starting point for the reconciliation exercise. The impact of the
Group entities belonging to the Group (but not to the Accent Group) have been added in the column with
the ‘changes in the consolidation perimeter’. The entities added to the consolidation perimeter as per
1 January 2016 are:

- HOHR (on a stand-alone basis);

- the Abylsen Group; and

- We Are One BVBA.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 First time adoption of IFRS (Continued)**

**_(ii) IFRS remeasurements and classifications_**

**A.** **Deconsolidation of the TEC Group NV and Zaquensis Group**

The Group acquired, via its subsidiary Accent Jobs for People NV, shares of the following entities in 2016:

- Zaquensis Group as per 31 May 2016 in which the Group holds 65.00% of the ordinary share capital
at the acquisition date; and

- TEC Group as per 31 August 2016 in which the Group holds 73.50% of the ordinary share capital at
the acquisition date.

While control over entities is assessed under Belgian GAAP mainly by reference to the investment
percentage held by the Group, IFRS requires to assess which party can decide on the relevant activities of
the entity and is exposed to its variable returns.

Group management carefully reviewed the shareholders’ agreement of both entities. Following the
shareholders’ agreement, all significant financial and operational decisions require the approval of both
the Group and the minority shareholders (for the TEC Alliance Group) or require a quorum of 70% or
more (for the Zaquensis Group). Consequently, the Group does not have control over any of the entities
and has therefore accounted for these entities as joint ventures. This resulted in the derecognition of the
individual assets and liabilities of both groups that previously were consolidated under Belgian GAAP in
full and replaced these by an equity accounted investment into both groups.

Refer to the joint venture disclosure for more information (Note 4.2).

**B.** **Property, plant and equipment (PP&E)**

PP&E as per 1 January 2016 increased with EUR 7.15 million and with an amount of EUR 4.72 million as
per 31 December 2017.

The impact on the total comprehensive income as per 31 December 2017 is EUR 0.31 million negative.

These adjustments are related to the following:

_(a) Review of the estimated useful life of PP&E_

The Group has reviewed and aligned its estimated useful life for PP&E at its transition date to IFRS. As a
result, depreciation was re-calculated based on the revised estimated useful life of the assets resulting in an
increase of the carrying amounts for PP&E of EUR 0.93 million as per 1 January 2016 and a decrease of
EUR 0.18 million as per 31 December 2017.

The impact on the total comprehensive income of the Group as per 31 December 2017 is an increase of the
depreciations with EUR 0.31 million.

_(b) Accounting for decommissioning obligations_

The Group leases a large number of offices (i.e. local branches) for its operations. These lease transactions
are currently accounted for as operating leases by the Group. The Group however completed several
operating leasehold improvements for which a restoration obligation exists. Under Belgian GAAP,
restoration costs were accounted for when incurred on a cash basis. IFRS requires to recognize the
restoration obligations at the moment the obligation arises for an amount equal to the estimated net
present value of the restoration obligation. These amounts are then recognized as part of the acquisition
cost of the capitalized asset and as a provision in accordance with IAS 37.

The Group increased its PP&E and recognized a provision for restoration obligations of EUR 0.49 million
at 1 January 2016 and an amount of EUR 0.57 million as per 31 December 2017.

There is no impact of the decommissioning obligations on the total comprehensive income for the period
ended per 31 December 2017 given that the additional provisions are accounted for against PP&E and the
impact of the unwinding of the provision is not material.

**3 First time adoption of IFRS (Continued)**

_(c) Finance Leases_

Under Belgian GAAP all leases of company cars and buildings were classified as operating leases as there
was no full reconstitution of the underlying fair value of the leased asset over the lease term. In line with
IFRS, however, some of these leases have been reclassified as finance leases as the Group has obtained
from the lessor substantially all the risks and rewards relating to the assets leased.

As per 1 January 2016, PP&E increased with an amount of EUR 6.73 million while the lease liability
increased with EUR 6.68 million (EUR 4.80 million non-current lease liabilities and EUR 1.88 million
current lease liabilities). An amount of EUR 29 thousand was accounted for under the retained earnings.

An adjustment as per 31 December 2017 was recorded of EUR 6.34 million under PP&E and an amount
of EUR 6.15 million as lease debt (EUR 4.20 million non-current lease liabilities and EUR 1.95 million
current lease liabilities). An amount of EUR 112 thousand was accounted for under the retained earnings.

The net-impact of the leases on the total comprehensive income for the period amounts to
EUR 72 thousand. Additional depreciations of EUR 0.17 million and interest expenses of
EUR 0.14 million are compensated by a decrease of the operational lease expenses of EUR 0.38 million.

_(d) Reclassification between intangible assets and PP&E_

An amount of EUR 1.0 million of software was initially classified under PP&E and has been reclassified to
intangible assets as per 1 January 2016. An amount of EUR 0.22 million was reclassified as per
31 December 2017.

_(e) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced the carrying amount of PP&E as per
31 December 2017 with EUR 1.77 million. As the acquisitions were completed after the Group’s
transitions’ date to IFRS, no impact was noted as per 1 January 2016.

**C.** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets as per 1 January 2016 increased with EUR 1.03 million and with an amount of
EUR 122.79 million as per 31 December 2017.

A negative impact of EUR 6.36 million was noted on the total comprehensive income as per 31 December
2017.

These adjustments are related to the following:

_(a) Purchase Price Allocation in accordance with IFRS 3_

Intangible assets as per 31 December 2017 increased with EUR 122.96 million as a result of the purchase
price allocation that was completed in accordance with IFRS 3 in 2016 and 2017 for the acquired
subsidiaries. The major amounts recognized as intangible assets relate to the purchase price allocation of
the TimePartner Group, Effect, the Redmore Group, Vialegis and Mach Professional. The identifiable
intangible assets acquired mainly consist of customer relationships and trademarks.

Refer to the Business Combination Note 4.1 for more information.

As the entities were acquired after the Group’s date of transition to IFRS, no impact on the Groups IFRS
figures was noted at that date.

Additional amortization on the trademark and the customer relationships recognized as part of the
purchase price allocations amount to EUR 6.24 million.

_(b) Review of the estimated useful life of intangible assets_

The Group has reviewed and aligned its estimated useful life for intangible assets at its transition date to
IFRS. As a result, amortization was re-calculated based on the revised estimated useful life of the assets

F-169

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 First time adoption of IFRS (Continued)**

resulting in an increase of the carrying amounts for intangible assets of EUR 37 thousand as per 1 January
2016 and EUR 0.31 million as per 31 December 2017.

_(c) Reclassification between intangible assets and PP&E_

An amount of EUR 1.0 million of software was initially classified under PP&E and has been reclassified to
intangible assets as per 1 January 2016. An amount of EUR 0.22 million was reclassified as per
31 December 2017.

_(d) Derecognition of research costs_

Under Belgian GAAP, the Group recognized both research and development costs for a number of
internally generated software applications. Under IFRS only development costs can be capitalized if the
recognition criteria of paragraph 57 of IAS 38 have been fulfilled. While no impact of this was noted at the
Group’s transition date to IFRS, a decrease of the carrying amount of the intangible assets was noted of
EUR 0.16 million as per 31 December 2017.

An additional cost was recognized in the total comprehensive income of EUR 0.12 million as per
31 December 2017.

_(e) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced the carrying amount of intangible assets as
per 31 December 2017 with EUR 0.54 million. As the acquisitions were completed after the Group’s
transition’s date to IFRS, no impact was noted as per 1 January 2016.

**D.** **Goodwill**

While the amount of the goodwill was not impacted at the Group’s date of transition to IFRS, a decrease
of the carrying amount of EUR 31.6 million was noted as per 31 December 2017.

Total comprehensive income as per 31 December 2017 improved with EUR 71.06 million.

_(a) Reversal of amortization of goodwill_

Goodwill under Belgian GAAP is amortized over a period of 5 to 10 years whereas goodwill under IFRS is
not amortized but tested annually for impairment purposes.

The Group applied the IFRS 1 exemption for business combinations. Therefore, there is no impact on
goodwill as per 1 January 2016.

Reversals of amortization of goodwill throughout 2016 and 2017 resulted in an increase of the carrying
amount of goodwill of EUR 118.07 million.

The reversal of the amortizations on the goodwill had a positive impact of EUR 71.06 million on the total
comprehensive income of the Group for the period ended as per 31 December 2017.

_(b) Purchase Price Allocation in accordance with IFRS 3_

As a result of the purchase price allocation in accordance with IFRS 3 that have been completed in 2016
and 2017, acquired trademarks and customer relationships have been recognized by the Group, resulting in
a decrease of goodwill as per 31 December 2017 with EUR 86.14 million.

_(c) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced the carrying amount of goodwill as per
31 December 2017 with EUR 63.53 million. As the acquisitions were completed after the Group’s
transition’s date to IFRS, no impact was noted as per 1 January 2016.

**E.** **Deferred tax assets and liabilities**

The net position of the deferred income tax position of the Group increased with EUR 11.90 million
(EUR 0.67 million of deferred income tax assets and EUR 12.58 million for deferred income tax liabilities)
and EUR 39.58 million (reduction of EUR 0.27 million of deferred income tax assets and an increase of
EUR 39.31 million for deferred income tax liabilities) at the Group’s date of transition and 31 December
2017 respectively. This fully relates to:

_(a) Temporary differences between carrying amount and tax bases of assets and liabilities_

The various adjustments at 1 January 2016 and at 31 December 2017 lead to different temporary
differences between the IFRS carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax
adjustments calculated on such differences are recognized either in retained earnings or are a separate
component of equity. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recognized on the fair
value adjustments of the different purchase price allocations. Tax have been netted within the same legal
entity or within the same fiscal unit.

Net impact for the total comprehensive income for the period per 31 December 2017 amounts to a
deferred income tax of EUR 0.85 million.

**F.** **Equity accounted investments**

While the amount of the equity accounted investments was not impacted at the Group’s date of transition
to IFRS, an increase of the carrying amount of EUR 34.05 million was noted as per 31 December 2017.

_(a) Accounting for the equity accounted investments_

While both the Zaquensis Group and the TEC Alliance Group were consolidated in full under Belgian
GAAP, both entities are accounted for as a joint venture under IFRS. The initial acquisition value as per
acquisition date of both joint ventures amounted to EUR 32.91 million. The Group acquired additional
shares for an amount of EUR 0.23 million as per 2017.

_(b) Accounting for the cumulative result from equity accounted investments_

A cumulative adjustment of EUR 1.91 million was accounted for as per 31 December 2017 for the result of
both the joint ventures held by the Group. As these acquisitions were completed throughout 2016, no
adjustments were made at the Group’s date of transition to IFRS.

The total comprehensive income of the period ended per 31 December 2017 increased with
EUR 2.87 million as a result of derecognizing the full P&L of Zaquensis and TEC (EUR 0.96 million) and
by applying the equity accounting (EUR 1.91 million).

**G.** **Derivative asset and liabilities**

_(a) Accounting for derivative financial instruments not previously recognized_

As per 1 January 2016, the Group had outstanding derivatives which were not recognized in the Belgian
GAAP financial statements. The Group recognized an embedded derivative asset of EUR 0.70 million and
an interest rate swap liability of EUR 0.28 million. There were no outstanding positions as per
31 December 2017.

A net impact of EUR 33 thousand for the derivatives is noted in the total comprehensive income of the
Group as per 31 December 2017.

**H.** **Other non-current assets**

_(a) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced other non-current assets with a carrying
amount of 0.03 million.

F-171

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 First time adoption of IFRS (Continued)**

**I.** **Trade and other receivables:**

Trade and other receivables as per 1 January 2016 increased with EUR 24.45 million and decreased with an
amount of EUR 8.66 million as per 31 December 2017.

An impact on total comprehensive income of EUR 0.4 million is noted as per 31 December 2017.

These adjustments are related to the following:

_(a) Factoring agreement with continuing involvement_

The Group entered into different agreements to assign partly its accounts receivable portfolio to a
factoring company. Under Belgian GAAP, any accounts receivable purchased by the factor is derecognized
from the balance sheet. Under IFRS however, as the derecognition criteria as included in IFRS 9 are not
fulfilled (the credit risk and the late payment risk remaining with the Group), receivables are not
derecognized and any amounts received from the factor following the purchase are recognized as a
financial liability.

An amount of EUR 25.01 million and EUR 25.00 million was recognized as a trade receivable and a
current finance liability as per 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017 respectively.

As for the factoring both an asset and liability are recognized, no impact on the total comprehensive
income as per 31 December 2017 is noted.

_(b) Expected credit loss model in accordance with IFRS 9_

Under local GAAP, the allowance for impairment of receivables consists of both a specific amount for
incurred losses and a general amount for expected future losses. Under IFRS, the Group has applied the
impairment guidance on financial instruments foreseen in IFRS 9. Consequently, the Group measures the
loss allowance on its receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, as applied based
on a provision matrix.

An additional loss allowance of EUR 0.57 million and EUR 0.56 million has been recorded on the trade
and other receivables at 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017 respectively.

The impact on the total comprehensive income for the period as per 31 December 2017 amounts to
EUR 0.4 million.

_(c) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced trade and other receivables and loans to
related parties with a carrying amount of EUR 33.74 million.

**J.** **Loans to related parties**

An amount of EUR 50.06 million was accounted for as a loan to related parties towards TEC and
Zaquensis.

**K.** **Cash and cash equivalents**

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced cash and cash equivalents with a carrying
amount of EUR 8.51 million.

**3 First time adoption of IFRS (Continued)**

**L.** **Inventory**

While the amount of the inventory was not impacted at the Group’s date of transition to IFRS, a decrease
of the inventory as per 31 December 2017 of EUR 5.58 million was noted as a result of:

_(a) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced the inventory of the Group with
EUR 5.58 million. The amounts capitalized under Belgian GAAP mainly relate to works ongoing at
31 December 2017 within the TEC business for which the Group applied the percentage of completion
method.

**M.** **Non-current and current borrowings**

The net position of the non-current and current borrowings under IFRS as compared to Belgian GAAP
decreased with an amount of EUR 9.09 million as per 1 January 2016 and increased with an amount of
EUR 5.81 million as per 31 December 2017. This is mainly related to:

_(a) Accounting for the vendor loan note_

Under Belgian GAAP, the Group has recognized a financial liability for the vendor loan at its nominal
amount, plus the accrued interest based on a contractual rate of interest of 2%. Under IFRS, the vendor
loan has been initially measured at fair value, by discounting the future cash flows (principal and interest)
at the market interest rate and has been measured at amortized cost. This resulted in a decrease in the
financial liability of EUR 37.00 million at 1 January 2016. No impact was noted as per 31 December 2017
given the settlement of this vendor loan note.

_(b) Accounting for the non-convertible bond_

Under Belgian GAAP, the Group has recognized a financial liability for a non-convertible bond at its
nominal amount of EUR 35 million. The non-convertible bond provides the holder with a yearly coupon of
4.5% and an annual interest rate to be capitalized of 3.5%. Similar to the vendor loan note above, the
non-convertible bond is initially measured at fair value under IFRS, by discounting the future cash flows
(principal and interest) at the market interest rate and has been measured at amortized cost. This resulted
in an increase of the financial liability of EUR 2.46 million at 1 January 2016.

_(c) Accounting for the convertible bond_

In 2016, the vendor loan has been partially repaid and partially converted to convertible bonds. Just before
year-end 2017 all remaining convertible bonds have been converted to equity. Under Belgian GAAP,
additional share capital has been recognized at the nominal value of the convertible bonds which
corresponds to the amount of issued share capital as per notary deed. Accrued interest based on
contractual rate remained to be recognized as a short-term financial liability, as the intention was to
convert this to equity during 2018. An amount of EUR 4.79 million of accrued interests remained
outstanding as per 31 December 2017, increasing the outstanding debt position of the Group.

Total comprehensive income for the period ended 31 December 2017 is impacted by an amount of
EUR 2.90 million for interest expenses relating to an interest adjustment on the convertible bond. This
adjustment is a difference between interest expenses recorded under BE GAAP based on contractual
interest rate of 2% and interest expenses recorded under IFRS based on amortized cost method.

_(d) Factoring agreement with continuing involvement_

Refer to the note above for more information.

_(e) Capitalization of transaction costs related to the Senior Facility Agreement:_

At 31 December 2016, the Group had a gross amount of EUR 315.5 million of outstanding bank loans
under the Senior Facility Agreement bearing variable interest rates. The nominal amount of the amounts

F-173


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 First time adoption of IFRS (Continued)**

drawn under the agreement as per 31 December 2016, net of transaction costs, was EUR 307.7 million
(EUR 7.83 million of transaction costs were recognized under IFRS). This Senior Facility Agreement has
been replaced in 2017 by a new Senior Facility Agreement for which a gross amount EUR 475.0 million
was outstanding as per 31 December 2017. The carrying amount of the drawings, net of transaction cost,
was EUR 456.9 million (EUR 18.1 million of transaction costs were recognized under IFRS decreasing the
outstanding liabilities of the Group). Transaction costs under Belgian GAAP are expensed when incurred.

Total comprehensive income of 31 December 2017 IFRS adjustment of EUR 10.3 million for capitalization
of transaction costs on SFA relates to EUR 18.1 million of capitalized transaction costs on the new SFA
signed in 2017, which were offset by transaction costs of EUR 7.8 million which were paid for the old SFA
signed in 2016 (costs were initially capitalized in 2016, but then released to the income statement in 2017
upon extinguishment of the old SFA from 2016).

_(f)_ _Reclassification between other liabilities to non-current borrowings_

An amount of EUR 0.11 million was reclassed from the other liabilities to the non-current borrowings as
per 1 January 2016. An amount of EUR 0.76 million, related to preferred equity shares payable, was
reclassified from the borrowings to the other liabilities. An amount of EUR 1.67 million related to
earn-outs was reclassified from the non-current borrowings to the other non-current liabilities as per
31 December 2017.

_(g) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced the non-current and current borrowings
with EUR 3.40 million as per 31 December 2017.

**N.** **Non-current and current employee benefit obligations**

The increase of the non-current and current employee benefits amounts to EUR 0.60 million as per
1 January 2016 and EUR 17.68 million as per 31 December 2017.

Total comprehensive income for the Group as per 31 December 2017 decreased with EUR 0.37 million.

_(a) Accounting for jubilee premiums and sickness provisions_

HOHR staff is entitled to a jubilee benefit after a number of years of seniority within the Group. The
calculation of these jubilee benefit obligations in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 resulted in
the recognition of an additional liability of EUR 0.35 million at 1 January 2016, which increased to
EUR 1.07 million by 31 December 2017.

The Group also covers insurance risk for employees who are on long-term sickness leave for some entities
in the Netherlands. An amount of EUR 0.11 million and EUR 0.38 million was accounted for by the
Group as per 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017 respectively.

The impact of the jubilee premiums and the sickness provision had an impact of EUR 0.37 million in the
total comprehensive income of the Group as per 31 December 2017. An amount of EUR 0.36 million was
related to jubilee premiums. The remaining amount relates to additional accruals for sickness leave.

_(b) Ratchets_

The Group offers, as part of a management incentive program, ratchets to the managers of different
Group entities. The ratchets provide the managers with a compensation for the excess return realized by
the Group in case of an exit or sale of the shares. The amount of the compensation is based upon the value
of the entity’s shares upon exit. The transaction is therefore within the scope of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based
payment’. The ratchet premiums entitle the beneficiaries to a cash payment, equal to the ratchet. For
Continu and Covebo the ratchet scheme has been considered in the labor agreement. As a result, an
additional employee benefit obligation amounting to EUR 0.14 million has been accounted for these
share-based payments at 1 January 2016. Within the context of the 2018 roll-over it was decided by end of
2017 to settle the ratchet plans in 2018.

_(c) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced other non-current and current employee
benefits with EUR 19.13 million as per 31 December 2017.

**O.** **Non-current and current provisions**

The amount of the provisions as per 1 January 2016 increased with an amount of EUR 0.49 million. The
amount of the provisions and 31 December 2017 decreased with EUR 0.77 million due to:

_(a) Accounting for decommissioning obligations_

The Group recognized a provision for restoration obligations of EUR 0.49 million at 1 January 2016. An
amount of EUR 0.57 million was reported under the provisions as per 31 December 2017. Refer to the B.
for more information.

_(b) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced other non-current and current provisions
with EUR 1.34 million.

**P.** **Other non-current and current liabilities:**

The increase of the non-current and current liabilities amounted to EUR 10.90 million and
EUR 10.97 million as per 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017 respectively.

Net impact on the total comprehensive income as per 31 December 2017 amounts to a reduction of the
expenses of EUR 3.63 million.

_(a) Share-based payment—option plan_

The Group offered share options on the shares of We are One BVBA, a 100% subsidiary of HOHR to a
selected group of key managers. The beneficiaries have the possibility to sell the acquired option shares to
the group in case of an exit or a refinancing of the Group, which creates for the Group an unavoidable
obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction in cash.

Accounting for the cash-settled share-based payment plan under IFRS as per 1 January 2016 resulted in
the recognition of an additional liability of EUR 5.76 million. As per end 2017 a decision was taken by the
Group to settle the plan in 2018. An amount of EUR 52.65 million, corresponding to the effective payment
made in 2018, was accrued for as per 31 December 2017 under the other current liabilities under IFRS and
Belgian GAAP.

For the period ended per 31 December 2017, a cost of EUR 4.88 million was reversed in the total
comprehensive income to align the amounts booked under Belgian GAAP to IFRS.

_(b) Ratchets_

An additional liability amounting to EUR 0.58 million has been accounted for the share-based payments at
1 January 2016, of which EUR 0.14 million has been accounted for as employee benefit obligation and
EUR 0.44 million has been accounted for as other current liability. Within the context of the 2018 roll-over
it was decided by end of 2017 to settle the ratchet plans in 2018. An additional amount of
EUR 3.11 million was accrued for under the other current liabilities.

Compared to Belgian GAAP an additional cost of EUR 1.26 million is accounted in the total
comprehensive income of the Group as per 31 December 2017.

_(c) Preferred equity shares_

As part of its expansion strategy, the Group acquired several entities prior to its conversion to IFRS.
Together with minority shareholders, the Group contributed to the subscribed capital of these entities. The

F-175


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 First time adoption of IFRS (Continued)**

total subscribed capital of these entities consists out of both ordinary shares and preferred shares. These
preferred shares provide the holder to a right of a preferential dividend of 8% per annum that becomes
payable upon the resolution by the Shareholders’ Assembly.

In case of insufficient distributable profit, the right to a preferred dividend is carried forward on a
cumulative basis.

Under Belgian GAAP, the cumulative amount of the preferred dividends was accounted for as a liability.
Under IFRS however, given that the decision to distribute is at the discretion of the shareholders and has
not been taken place at the balance sheet date, the dividends payables are classified within equity.

An amount of EUR 1.45 million has been derecognized as a liability and recycled to equity at 1 January
2016. As per 31 December 2017, no adjustment has been made.

_(d) Lease liabilities_

As per 1 January 2016, PP&E increased with an amount of EUR 6.73 million while the lease liability
increased with EUR 6.68 million (EUR 4.80 million non-current lease liabilities and EUR 1.88 million
current lease liabilities). An amount of EUR 29 thousand was accounted for under the retained earnings.

An adjustment as per 31 December 2017 was booked of EUR 6.33 million under PP&E and an amount of
EUR 6.15 million as lease debt (EUR 4.20 million non-current lease liabilities and EUR 1.95 million
current lease liabilities).

Net impact on the total comprehensive income of the Group as per 31 December 2017 amounts to
EUR 72 thousand. Refer to Note B for more information.

_(e) Accrual on convertible bond_

As per 1 January 2016, an amount of EUR 0.42 million is recorded as accrued interest on the convertible
bond. An amount of EUR 4.79 million was accounted for as per 31 December 2017.

_(f)_ _Reclassification from other liabilities to non-current borrowings_

Refer to above for more information.

_(g) Deconsolidation of Zaquensis and TEC Group_

The deconsolidation of the Zaquensis and TEC Group reduced other non-current and current provisions
with EUR 3.96 million as per 31 December 2017.

**4 Group structure of the House of HR**

Since the creation of the Belgian Accent Group in 1995, the Group has significantly expanded its business
as a result of a number of important and material external acquisitions. All these acquisitions are in-line
with the mid- to long-term strategy of the House of HR to gain a more international foothold and to
become a Group mainly offering services around specialized recruitment and engineering consulting. The
Group is now active in more than 10 European countries.

The acquisition strategy of the Group, prior to the legal reorganization of the Group that was completed in
2018 (Refer to Note 4.4), was to acquire a majority stake in all the acquired entities. Apart from the 2016
initial stake acquisition in the Zaquensis Group and the TEC Alliance Group, which are classified as joint
ventures as the Group only has joint control into these entities (Refer to Note 4.2), the Group obtained
control over all its acquisitions. For all transactions, the minority shareholders represent the former
management of the acquired companies (Refer to Note 4.4). Upon the acquisition date, the Group
performed a purchase price allocation in accordance with IFRS 3 for the acquired entities over which it has
control.

As part of the legal reorganization of the Group completed in 2018, the majority of these minority
shareholders exchanged their non-controlling interests, together with any related shareholder loans

**4 Group structure of the House of HR (Continued)**

(financial liabilities recognized in various entities of the group) for cash and new shares issued by the
parent company of the Group. Consequently, the Group currently holds into the majority of its subsidiaries
100% of the issued shares. The roll-over of Redmore and Vialegis has been completed early 2019. As a
result of the changes in the equity held by non-controlling interests, the Group has adjusted the carrying
amounts of the controlling and any remaining non-controlling interests to reflect the changes in their
relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid are directly recognized into equity.

The Group also obtained control over the Zaquensis Group and the TEC Alliance Group throughout
2018. The group has remeasured its previously held equity interest in these entities at its acquisition-date
fair value and recognized a resulting gain or loss, if any, in other gains/losses.

Refer to note 4.1 and 23 for more information.

**_(i) Overview of completed acquisitions_**

Since 1 January 2016, several business combinations have been completed by the Group. While the Group
obtains control over the acquired entities, the Group does normally not acquire all of the issued shares of
these entities. The remaining shares are held by the former management of the acquired entities. To
facilitate the acquisitions, new holdings have been created in which the Group and the minority
shareholders both contribute into the share capital in relation to the shares in the holding held by them.
These holdings are consolidated in full by the Group. Amounts allocated to the minority shareholders are
recognized as a separate component of the equity of the Group.

**TimePartner Group**

On 30 November 2016, TimePartner Group Service GmbH, an 83,33% owned entity by HOHR, acquired

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4 Group structure of the House of HR (Continued)**

The goodwill as a result of these acquisitions is attributable to the workforce and the expected high
profitability of the acquired business. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

_Accounting policy choice for non-controlling interests_

IFRS allows the Group to recognize the non-controlling interests in an acquired entity either at fair value
or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. This
decision is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.

Group Management decided to recognize all the non-controlling interests at fair value.

_Acquired receivables_

The following table summarizes the fair value of acquired trade receivables as per acquisition date:

**2018** **2017** **2016**
**Total acquired** **Total acquired** **Total acquired**
**receivables** **receivables** **receivables**
**Acquired receivables** **per 2018** **per 2017** **per 2016**

Contractual amount of trade receivables due . . . . . . . . . . . . **82.877.108** 29.620.633 46.297.476
Amount of uncollectible trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �676.812 0 �630.898

**Fair value of acquired trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **82.200.296** 29.620.633 45.666.578

The gross amount of the acquired trade receivables approximates its fair value. As per 31 December 2016
and 31 December 2018 respectively, an amount of EUR 0.6 million and EUR 0.7 million has been
impaired. Group management is expecting that the full contractual amounts can be collected.

_Revenue and profit contribution_

The acquired businesses contributed since its acquisition dates the following amount of revenue and net
profit to the Group:

**2018** **2017** **2016**
**Contribution to revenue and net profit since the date of the acquisition:** **Total 2018** **Total 2017** **Total 2016**

Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **195.848.241** 7.051.451 20.342.341
Net profit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **9.324.297** 750.769 �2.330.942

If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January of the year, consolidated pro-forma revenue and net profit
for the year ended would have been:

**2018** **2017** **2016**
**Contribution to revenue and net profit as if the acquisition was completed**
**per 1 January:** **Total 2018** **Total 2017** **Total 2016**

Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **310.720.834** 147.058.692 261.189.147
Net profit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **17.213.065** 36.155.223 �1.173.548

These amounts have been calculated using the subsidiary’s results, adjusting them for:

- differences in the accounting policies between the Group and the subsidiary, and

- the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value
adjustments to intangible assets had applied from 1 January of every year, together with the
consequential tax effects.

_Contingent assets and contingent liabilities_

The Group did not recognize any material contingent asset or contingent liabilities under the purchase
price allocation exercise.

**4.2 Interests in joint ventures**

The Group invested, via its subsidiary Accent Jobs for People NV, in two joint ventures in 2016, which, in
the opinion of the directors of the Group, are material to the Group. The share capital of the Zaquensis
Group (a general staffing company mainly dedicated to blue collar workers with specialization in
healthcare and interim work) only consists of ordinary shares. The share capital of the TEC Alliance
Group (a Group mainly active in the engineering business), however, both consists of ordinary shares and
preferred shares. These preferred shares provide to the holder a right of a preferential dividend of 8% per
annum that becomes payable upon the resolution of the Shareholders’ Assembly. The preferred shares,
however, do not have any voting rights. Consequently, there is a difference between the proportion of
ownership interests held and the voting rights held by the Group for TEC Alliance Group.

The country of incorporation or registration is also their principal place of business.

As per November 2017, the Group acquired an additional stake of 0.32% of the ordinary shares of the
TEC Alliance Group from the other shareholders of TEC Alliance Group for a price of
EUR 239 thousand.

Both joint ventures became subsidiaries as the Group acquired from the minority shareholders the
remaining shares in 2018. Refer to Note 4.1 and 4.5 for more information. Per 31 December 2018 there are
no material interests in joint ventures.

- _Phase 1: Transfer of legal entities, legal mergers and (partial) de-mergers of various entities controlled by_
_the Group_

In 2018, the Group completed a number of internal transfers of legal entities within the Group as well as it
completed a number of legal mergers and (partial) de-mergers of various entities that were under the
control of the parent.

In addition, all assets and liabilities hold by The House of Loyalty NV, a special purpose entity which is
fully owned by key management of the Group, were merged with these of HOHR. The House of
Loyalty NV did not have any other business purpose/activities than holding shares in HOHR. As a result of
this transaction, key management of the Group effectively exchanged their shares held in ‘‘The House of
Loyalty NV’’ into shares in ‘‘HOHR NV’’.

As the legal merger is considered as a transaction between the Group parent company (HOHR) and its
shareholders, there is no change at the level of HOHR. Therefore, transactions with shareholders do not
give rise to profit or loss, any gain or loss is recognized directly in the equity of the Group.

The remaining internal transfers completed by the Group did not result in material changes in the
composition of the assets and liabilities of the Group. The number of shares of the Group increased with
6.893.459 shares corresponding to a decrease in paid-in capital of EUR 4.66 million.

- _Phase 2: Elimination of non-controlling interests held by former management of the acquired businesses_

All non-controlling interests held by former management of the Group into the different sub holdings were
eliminated throughout the second phase of the reorganization of the Group[1]. These non-controlling
interest holders both held ordinary and preference shares in the operating subsidiaries (OpCos) that were
both classified as equity under IFRS.

The minority shareholders exchanged their non-controlling interests, together with any related shareholder
loans (financial liabilities recognized in various sub-entities of the Group) for cash and new shares issued
by the Group. Once the transaction was completed, the Group owned all equity instruments of the
majority of its subsidiaries.

The following contributions were made by the former minority shareholders towards the Group:

Besides above-mentioned contributions done by the former minority shareholders, a total of EUR 54.07
million of ordinary and preferred shares has been sold by the minority shareholders to HOHR.

The newly issued shares had the following terms and conditions:

1. Ordinary C shares:

Ordinary C shares provide the holder with the right to a dividend which is discretionary upon
decision of the general shareholders’ meeting. In case of a departure of a holder of the shares,
different purchase and sales options exist, depending upon the type of departure (defined as a
‘‘Good Leaver Event’’ or a ‘‘Bad Leaver Event’’).

Each ordinary share and convertible tracking share give right to one vote. C shares do not give
right to appoint the members of the board of directors. Tag-along and drag-along rights are also
attached to class C shares.

2. Class C convertible tracking shares

Class C convertible tracking shares are convertible into the ordinary shares of the parent when
predetermined events provided for in the articles of association of the parent company or the
shareholders’ agreement take place. The conversion of convertible tracking shares in a number of
ordinary shares will be based upon a predefined formula. The tracking shares entitle their holders
to rights linked to the performance of the respective OpCo, in the event of a liquidation or
dissolution of the Company, a dividend distribution by the Company or an Exit.

3. Preference shares

Preference shares in the Group are issued as a compensation for old preference shares and
shareholder loans of the subsidiaries that were hold by the former non-controlling interest
holders. The holders of the preference shares are, with regard to each financial year of the

company for which the shares have been issued, entitled to the distribution of a cumulative
preferential dividend from the (possible) profit and reserves available for distribution within the
Company, at the annual fixed percentage of 8% (PA 8) and 8.5% (PA 8.5). Distribution of the
preference dividends are subject to the decision of the General shareholders meeting. The
preferential dividends do not confer a further right to participate in the profits of the Company
other than the preferential dividends.

Shareholders of the Group can decide to distribute dividends on ordinary and tracking shares. The share of
total dividend ‘‘allocated’’ to the tracking shares depends on the performance of the OPCOs (increase in
its equity value). However, the group has no contractual obligation to distribute dividends on tracking
shares, the normal declaration and approval procedures apply. Dividend on ordinary share cannot be
distributed unless preference shares cumulative dividend is paid out first.

Changes in the non-controlling interests in the Group’s ownership interest after control is obtained, that
do not result in a change in control of the subsidiary, have been accounted for within equity. Therefore, no
gain or loss in the income statement on selling the subsidiary’s shares has been recognized. Neither any
additional goodwill has been reflected when acquiring additional shares. Instead, the carrying amount of
the non-controlling interest has been adjusted to reflect the change in the ownership interest in the
subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the
fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in equity and attributed to the Group’s equity
holders.

Some of the rollover transactions (Zaquensis Group and TEC Alliance Group) resulted in a change of
control—before the transaction the group had no controlling interest in these equity accounted entities—
refer for more information to Note 4.2. For these transactions, the Group allocated the fair value of the
consideration transferred to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and the residual amount should
be recognized on the balance sheet as goodwill. The pre-existing interest has been remeasured to fair value
as part of the purchase price allocation exercise with a resulting gain recognized in the profit at the
acquisition date.

The Group valued the issued equity instruments at fair value at the date when the financial liabilities were
extinguished.

**5 Financial risk management**

**5.1 Financial risk factors**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including limited foreign
exchange risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and
seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The objective is to
identify, quantify, manage and then monitor events or actions that could lead to financial losses. The
Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain interest risk exposures. In particular, the
Group protects the variable interest rate on loans via the use of caps that limit the exposure to fluctuations
of Euribor.

Risk management is carried out by the Group’s treasury. Group’s treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges
financial risks with approval from the board of directors.

The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is very limited as the Group’s operations are essentially
denominated in euro. Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of these currencies of +/�10% is considered
as immaterial.

Interest rate risk

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose
the Group’s cash flow to an interest rate risk which is offset by the interest rate caps.

Caps in place cover 50% of the long-term bank borrowings at year-end 2018 (2017—none (no caps),
2016—77%, 2015—22%) of the variable loan principal outstanding.

At 31 December 2018, the Group had EUR 600 million of outstanding bank loans, structured as a bullet
loan under the Senior Facility Agreement. Once per year, excess cash flow is calculated based on final
audited accounts which serve to determine whether a mandatory prepayment should take place under this
agreement. So far, no mandatory prepayments have taken place. These loans are floating rate borrowings,
with interest based on Euribor floored to zero plus a fixed margin of 4.25%. At year-end 2018, 50% of
these floating rate borrowings have been hedged via caps. The cap is set at 0.5%. If Euribor rises above
zero, the Group will be exposed to the interest rate risk only up to the 0.5%, and the interest rate can
therefore rise up to the maximum cap of 4.75%. Any increase of Euribor above 0.5% will be covered by the
cap agreement, and the Group will receive cash flows under the cap agreement that will offset any cash
outflows paid for increased interest to the banks. Therefore, the Group may only pay maximum interest of
4.75%, calculated net of hedge.

At 31 December 2017, the Group had EUR 475 million of bank loans under the Senior Facility agreement,
which also had floating interest rate of Euribor plus 4.25% margin. There were no active cap agreements at
the moment given the SFA was only closed on 21 December 2017. The caps were signed at the beginning of
2018.

At 31 December 2016, the Group had EUR 315.5 million of outstanding bank loans under the Senior
Facility Agreement. These loans are floating rate borrowings, with interests based on Euribor plus a fixed
margin, of 3.25% or 3.75% depending on a tranche. At year-end 2016, 77% of these floating rate
borrowings have been hedged via caps. Euribor is fixed to zero and the cap is set to zero as well. Any
increase of Euribor above zero will be covered by the cap agreement, and the Group will receive cash flows
under the cap agreement that will offset any cash outflows paid for increased interest to the banks.
Therefore, the Group may only pay maximum interest of 3.25% or 3.75%, depending on the tranche,
calculated net of hedge.

At 1st January 2016, the Group had EUR 111.6 million of outstanding bank loans, which were obtained
locally by subsidiaries. Only the loans at Accent were covered by the swaps, and they represent 22% of the
total loan amount.

At all four reporting periods, these floating rate borrowings are entirely accounted for at amortized cost,
and therefore the impact of changes in the market interest rate on the fair value of these floating rate
borrowings at the closing date will have no impact on the income statement or on the equity. The Group
does not apply hedge accounting. A derivative financial asset is recognized for these swaps and accounted
for at fair value.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**5 Financial risk management (Continued)**

The cap confirmations require settlement of net interest receivable or payable every 3 months. The
settlement dates coincide with the dates on which interest is payable on the underlying debt.

Euribor floating rate borrowings which are not covered by the swaps are subject to interest rate risk. An
increase (decrease) of 100 basis points in interest rate as per year-end would have an effect on profit after
tax and equity as follows:

**31/12/2018** **31/12/2017** **31/12/2016**

Increase 100 bps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **(3.599.000)** (130.000) (0)
Decrease 100 bps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **0*** 0* 0*

- covered by the swap

The impact of an increase of the Euribor is limited as a consequence of these arrangements. As in 2016,
the entire volume of floating interest rate bearing borrowings is covered by SWAPS, no impact could be
expected from an increase (decrease) in the Euribor. In 2017, a limited exposure should be considered as
the CAP rate is set at zero with only a short period of unhedged exposure at year-end as the new SFA was
signed. Of the total impact of 2018, EUR 1.4 million is from the period when the new SFA was not yet
covered by the CAP. The remaining EUR 2.2 million is from the period after the cap was in place (starting
22 May 2018). This can be explained by two factors: 1) the period covered by the cap is longer as this starts
at 22 May 2018 and 2) the cap only becomes active on half of the outstanding amount and when interest
rate is above 0.5%. As the base margin is the 3M Euribor which was mostly around �0.3%, which was then
impacted by +100bp for the sensitivity analysis, the amount of interest above 0.5% which is covered by the
CAP is rather limited.

Finally, a decrease of the Euribor interest rate has no impact, as the Euribor has a floor of 0%, with a
negative Euribor throughout the different reporting periods.

The Group has in total EUR 8.45 million of borrowings from related parties outstanding at the period
ended 31 December 2018 (EUR 17.7 million at 31 December 2017, EUR 177.8 million at 31 December
2016, and EUR 192.1 million at 1 January 2016).

- _Credit risk_

Credit risk for the Group mainly arises from cash and cash equivalents, favorable derivative financial
instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers,
including outstanding receivables.

_Risk management_

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk other than that for ordinary debtors. The Group
has policies to ensure that the services are provided to customers with an appropriate credit history.

Credit risk is managed locally by each subgroup (brand). Certain subsidiaries have implemented credit
control tools that helps the day-to-day management of collection of receivables. Certain companies have
credit insurance in place. Credit risk mainly arises as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding
receivables.

The credit quality of customers, considering the financial position of customers, past experience and other
factors, is closely assessed by the credit department on a regular basis. Individual risk limits are set based
on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the finance committee. The utilization of
credit limits is regularly monitored.

No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does not expect any losses
from non-performance by these counterparties.

_Impairment of financial assets_

The Group has three types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model:

- trade receivables for sales of services;

- contract assets resulting from project services in progress;

- debt investments carried at amortized cost.

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was no
identified impairment loss.

- _Trade receivables and contract assets_

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on
shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled work in
progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of
contracts.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 month before each
reporting year-end, starting from 31 December 2015, and the corresponding historical credit losses
experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking
information on macro-economic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and
1 January 2016 (on adoption of IFRS 9) was determined as follows for both trade receivables and contract
assets:

**More than** **More than** **More than**
**30 days** **60 days** **1 year**
**Current** **past due** **past due** **past due** **Total**

Trade receivables and contract assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a
debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group, and a failure to make contractual payments for a
period of greater than 120 days past due. Several factors are considered in assessing the likelihood of
impairment which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within
operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same
line item.

Previous accounting policy for impairment of trade receivables

In the period prior to year-end 2015, the impairment of trade receivables was assessed based on the
incurred loss model. Individual receivables which were known to be uncollectible were written off by
reducing the carrying amount directly. The other receivables were assessed collectively to determine
whether there was objective evidence that an impairment had been incurred but not yet been identified.
For these receivables the estimated impairment losses were recognized in a separate provision for
impairment. The Group considered that there was evidence of impairment if any of the following
indicators were present:

- significant financial difficulties of the debtor,

- probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and

- default or late payments (more than 120 days overdue).

Impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within
the selling expenses and the other general and administrative expenses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts
previously written off are credited against the same line item.

Current accounting policy for impairment of the trade receivables

As from 1st January 2016, the Group first applies this policy under the incurred loss model, and then, for
the rest of receivables which are not provided for, the Group applies the expected credit loss model, and
recognizes an additional provision.

- _Liquidity risk_

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and use of trade supplier credit terms.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group
treasury. Group treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has
sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed
borrowing facilities (Note 16) at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants
(where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s
debt financing plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets and, if
applicable external regulatory or legal requirements. The Group also uses factoring agreements with
certain banks in order to obtain early access to cash flows.

Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above balance required for working capital
management are transferred to the Group treasury. Surplus cash is retained to finance future growth of the
group through acquisitions.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain
an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Group is required to comply with the financial
covenant that the leverage ratio must be not more than 6.0:1.

The Group has complied with this covenant throughout the reporting period. As at 31 December 2018, the
leverage ratio of the group (net debt to EBITDA) was 2.73:1 (2.9:1 as at 31 December 2017).

- _Dividends_

The Group currently has a capital maintenance policy and thus in general no dividends are paid out to
majority shareholders. For the dividends declared and paid to minority shareholders, please refer to the
Note 4.4 on non-controlling interest.

**5.3 Fair value estimation**

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as trading and available-for-sale
securities) is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted (unadjusted) market price
used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in
level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example,
over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of
methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt. Other
techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the
estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using
quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date. The fair value of fuel price derivatives is determined
by using the fair values of the adjusted future positions at the end of the year. These instruments are
included in level 2.

The instruments included in level 3 are those for which one or more significant inputs are not based on
observable market data.

The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to
approximate their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by
discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the
Group for similar financial instruments.

There are no enforceable master netting arrangements. The related receivable and payable in the
statement of financial position are presented gross while upon payment the net position is settled. Bank
overdrafts are netted against cash as there is a legally enforceable right to offset.

The Group has pledged cash on bank accounts, intercompany receivables, and shares of the Group and the
most material subsidiaries, as described in the Note 16 on borrowings. In case of default, the banks would
be able to cover the debt from cash and intercompany receivables as shown in the table above, and the rest
in shares of the Group and related subsidiaries.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**6 Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could
result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities
affected in future periods.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and
of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be
wrong.

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

**6.1 Accounting judgements**

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following
judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial
statements:

**_Determination of the consolidation scope of the Group_**

The Group invested, via its subsidiary Accent Jobs for People NV, in two joint ventures (Zaquensis Group
and TEC Group) in 2016, which, in the opinion of the directors of the Group, are material to the Group.
Refer to Note 4.5 for more information on the actual percentages of shares held by the Group.

The share capital of the Zaquensis Group (a German company specialized in temp-to-perm operations in
healthcare, technical work, administration, finance and manufacturing) only consists of ordinary shares.
The share capital of the TEC Alliance Group (a Group mainly active in the engineering business),
however, consists both of ordinary shares and preferred shares. These preferred shares provide the holder
a right to a preferential dividend of 8% per annum that becomes payable upon resolution by the
Shareholders’ Assembly. The preferred shares, however, do not have any voting rights. Consequently,
there is a difference between the proportion of ownership interests held and the proportion of voting rights
held by The Group for TEC Alliance Group.

Through the shareholders’ agreement, all significant financial and operating decisions related to the
relevant activities of both Joint Ventures require the approval of both The Group and the minority
shareholders (for the TEC Alliance Group) or require a quorum of 70% or more (for the Zaquensis
Group).

Consequently, the Group does not have control, yet joint control, over both TEC Alliance and Zaquensis.
The investments have been accounted for initially as joint ventures. The Group, however, acquired the
remaining shares of both the Zaquensis Group (June 2018) and TEC Group (January 2018). Since then
these investments became subsidiaries and have been consolidated in full.

Refer to joint venture (Note 4.2) and business combination note (Note 4.1) for more information.

**_Accounting for factoring agreements within the Group_**

The Group entered into factoring agreements with banks, under which trade receivables of certain entities
within the Group are transferred to the factors. These entities are part of Accent Group, and the factoring
arrangements involve ING, BNP Paribas and KBC Bank. Significant judgement is needed in order to
assess whether the criteria for derecognition of these assets under IFRS 9 has been met, and whether the
Group can derecognize trade receivables at the moment of transfer to the factors.

In order to meet the IFRS 9 criteria for the derecognition, substantially all risks and rewards of ownership
related to the financial asset (i.e. receivable) need to be transferred to the factor.

For 2016 and 2017 the factoring agreement did not substantially transfer all risks and rewards of ownership
to the factor. As from 2018 a new factoring agreement was agreed which transferred all risks and rewards

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**6 Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (Continued)**

of ownership to the factor, resulting in a derecognition of the trade receivables at the moment of transfer
to the factors.

**_Lease classification_**

The Group entered, as a lessee, into a number of lease contracts for real estate as well as company cars.
Group Management exercises judgement in assessing whether or not the Group, at the inception of a lease
contract, has received substantially all of the risks and rewards related to the lease, and therefore the lease
is to be accounted for as a finance lease.

Group management’s assessment of its lease portfolio revealed that leased company cars for which there is
a mandatory purchase clause to be exercised by the Group at the termination of the contract have to be
accounted for as a finance lease by the Group.

The Group also accounted for its headquarter building in Roeselare as a finance lease as the minimum
lease payments made by the Group over the estimated lease term substantially covers the fair value of the
leased asset.

The Group entered, as a lessor, into a number of lease contracts for housing accommodation which it
subleases to individual employees of the Group. These contracts have been classified by the Group as
operating lease contracts as the lease term for the Group does represent the majority of the lease term of
the underlying asset being leased.

**_Capitalization of development costs_**

The Group internally develops software applications that are used in the day-to-day service offerings.

Development costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2. Initial capitalization
of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility of the internally
developed software is confirmed. Group management makes assumptions regarding the expected future
cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits.

**6.2 Critical judgments in applying the entities accounting policies**

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below.

The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial
statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however,
may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such
changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

**_Impairment testing on goodwill_**

Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable
amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in an
arm’s length transaction of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing
of the asset.

The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the
budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet
committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash
generating unit being tested.

The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as
well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**6 Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (Continued)**

The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash generating units,
including a sensitivity analysis, are further explained in Note 8.

**_Fair value of financial instruments_**

The Group has issued convertible and non-convertible bonds, which are initially measured at fair value,
and subsequently at amortized cost. The fair value was estimated by calculating the present value of the
future expected cash flows. The estimates are based on a discount rate which approximates the market
interest rate for a similar instrument on the market. Judgement is required in determining this market rate.
The Group determined the credit risk of the company based on the interest rate for the bank loan that the
Group has obtained during the year, adjusted for the risk-free rate of the Eurozone prevalent on the
market at issue. Based on the credit risk determined above, a credit margin was estimated based on the BB
and B USD composite curve. Total discount rate was estimated as a Euro Swap Curve increased with the
credit margin at the date of valuation. For more details refer to Note 16 on borrowings.

In relation to the non-convertible bond mentioned above, a derivative financial asset has been recognized
in relation to the embedded derivative—the right for the issuer to exercise an early payment option. As this
option is not considered to be closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized
separately from the host contract and has been measured at the fair value on initial recognition and
subsequently at fair value through income statement. Upon early repayment, exercised in July 2016, the
bond has been derecognized with any impact through income statement, as well as the derivative asset, and
any previously recognized deferred taxes. The fair value of the derivative was measured as an intrinsic
value of the derivative. This value is determined with reference to the relevant forward market interest rate
by subtracting the fair value of the liability without the option from the fair value of the liability if the
option is exercised at the valuation date including the indemnity (1%) to be paid. The market rates used
were determined through zero-coupon bonds based on the Euro Swap Curve plus the credit risk margin
based on the BB and B composite US credit curves as of the valuation date for each interest payment date.
The effective yield to maturity used for the valuation of derivatives at the end of 2015 was 6.0%. For more
details refer to Note 11 on derivatives.

**_Share-based payment plans and ratchets_**

The Group has offered to a selected group of managers share options on the shares of We are One BVBA,
a 100% subsidiary of HOHR, in order incentivize them to further develop the activities of the Group. The
options are initially measured at fair value at grant date, which is independently determined using an
adjusted form of the Black Scholes Model which includes a Monte Carlo simulation model that takes into
account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution (where material), the share price
at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield, the risk free
interest rate for the term of the option and the correlations and volatilities of the peer Group companies.
Significant judgement was made in order to determine these assumptions. For more details on the
assumptions used, refer to the Note 19.

The company also offers ratchet plans to the managers of the different Group entities. These managers are
often also minority shareholders in the respective Group Companies. The ratchets are initially measured at
fair value at the grant date. The fair value is independently determined using an adjusted form of the
Black & Scholes Model which includes a Monte Carlo simulation model that takes into account the
following assumptions: the exercise price, the term of the ratchet, the impact of dilution (where material),
the share price at the grant date, the expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected
dividend yield, the risk free interest rate for the term of the ratchet and the correlations and volatilities of
the peer Group companies. Significant judgement was made in order to determine these assumptions. For
more details on the assumptions used, refer to the Note 19.

**_Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination_**

As part of the purchase price allocations that were completed by the Group for the recent acquisitions of
the Group, both brand names and customer relationships have been accounted for by the Group at their
estimated fair value. In determining the fair value of these intangible assets, assumptions and estimates are

F-216

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**6 Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (Continued)**

made in relation to the long-term growth rate, discount rates and contributory asset charges are made.
Refer to note 4.1 for more information.

**_Taxes_**

Uncertainties may exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws,
and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business
relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences
arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could
necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.

The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by
the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based
on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations
by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.

Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions
prevailing in the respective Group company’s domicile. As the Group assesses the probability for litigation
and subsequent cash outflow with respect to taxes as remote, no contingent liability has been recognized.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgement is
required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely
timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

**_Useful life and residual value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment_**

Judgement is required in estimating the useful lives and residual value of intangible and tangible assets.
The residual value is the estimated amount that would be currently obtained from the disposal of the asset,
after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset was already of the age and in the condition
expected at the end of its useful life.

Group management reviews its estimated useful live as well as the residual value of intangible and tangible
assets on an annual basis.

Refer to the PP&E note (Note 9) and intangible assets note (Note 7) for more information.

The carrying amounts of the customer relationships and the brand names as per 31 December 2018
amount to EUR 133.83 million (31 December 2017: EUR 80.90 million, 31 December 2016:
EUR 29.75 million, 1 January 2016: EUR 0) and EUR 59.57 million (31 December 2017:
EUR 42.06 million, 31 December 2016: EUR 29.5 million, 1 January 2016: EUR 6.36 million) respectively.

The customer relationships and brand names were acquired as part of a business combination. They are
recognized at their fair value at the date of acquisition and are subsequently amortized on a straight-line
based on the timing of projected cash flows of the contracts over their estimated useful lives.

The fair value is determined on a basis that reflects an amount that the entity would have paid for the asset
in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties, based on the best information
available.

Refer to the Business Combination note (Note 4.1) for more information on the additions to the customer
relationships and the brand names.

**_(ii) Software_**

The Group capitalized amounts of both externally acquired software as internally developed software.
Internally developed software is initially classified under the category ‘‘Software under development’’ and
is transferred to the category ‘‘Internally generated software’’ once the software becomes available for use.
As from that moment amortizations will start.

Externally acquired software

The carrying amount of externally acquired software amounts to EUR 2.26 million as per 31 December
2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 1.56 million, 31 December 2016: EUR 1.56 million, 1 January 2016:
EUR 0.25 million).

The main amounts recorded for externally acquired software relates to licenses for ERP packages used
within the Group (mainly Tagetik and Navision). The additions in 2016, 2017 and 2018 mainly relate to
further enhancements of these ERP packages.

Internally developed software and software under development

The carrying amount of internally generated software under development amounts to EUR 9.36 million as
per 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 7.96 million, 31 December 2016: EUR 5.48 million,
1 January 2016: EUR 2.31 million).

The carrying amount of software under development amounts to EUR 3.00 million as per 31 December
2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 1.19 million, 31 December 2016: EUR 0.54 million, 1 January 2016:
EUR 1.43 million).

The majority of the internally developed software as well as the software under development relates to the
‘‘My tools’’ digital platform that is used by Accent Jobs for People to run the HR business. The
development of this platform consists of different separate modules such as the contracting module, the
candidate selection module, as well as a billing module. The main additions since 1 January 2016 relate to
further enhancements or the development of additional modules for the platform.

The Group did not expense a material amount of research and development expenditure in the income
statement since 1 January 2016.

**_(iii) Other intangibles_**

The carrying amounts of the other intangibles as per 31 December 2018 are EUR 0.28 million
((31 December 2017: EUR 0.28 million, 31 December 2016: EUR 0.29 million, 1 January 2016: EUR
0.13 million).

Amortizations on intangible assets are charged to the Selling Expenses (2018: EUR 15.13 million, 2017:
4.58 million, 2016: 0.69 million) and the General and administrative expenses (2018: EUR 6.29 million,
2017: 4.01 million, 2016: 1.35 million) in the statement of financial performance. An amount of EUR
71 thousand of amortizations on intangible assets was allocated to the cost of services during 2016.

**Key assumptions used in value in use calculations**

The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. For the 31 December
2018, 2017, 2016 and 1 January 2016 reporting period, the recoverable amount of the CGU’s was
determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions.

The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a
three-year period for 2016 impairment test, a four-year period for the 2017 impairment and a five-year
window for the 2018 impairment. Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using the
estimated growth rates stated below. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry
reports specific to the industry in which each CGU operates.

- **_Pre-tax discount rates: Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to_**
each cash generating unit, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying
assets which have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is
based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and derived from its
weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The
cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of
debt is based on the interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment-specific risk
is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on
publicly available market data.

- **_EBITDA margin: The EBITDA margins are based upon past performance and management’s_**
expectations for the future.

- **_Growth rate estimates: Rates are based on published inflation rates provided by the IMF (International_**
Monetary Fund). For the reasons explained above, the long-term rate is used to extrapolate the
projections.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

With regard to the assessment of value in use of the three CGU’s, being Specialized Staffing, Consulting
and Engineering and General Staffing, Group’s management believes that no reasonably possible change
in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its
recoverable amount.

**10 Financial instruments by category (Continued)**

The majority of financial assets and liabilities are classified as assets/liabilities at amortized cost, except for
derivatives which are measured at the fair value through profit or loss. For more details on accounting
policies applied for each category, please refer to the note 2.

The Group does not use derivatives for speculative investments. The full fair value of a hedging derivative
is classified as a non-current financial asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more
than 12 months and as a current financial asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than
12 months.

**_(i)_** **_Interest rate swaps and rate swaps_**

HOHR and Accent Jobs for People have entered into interest rate swaps and interest rate cap contracts to
limit the Group’s exposure to changes in the variable interest rate. The interest rate swaps a variable
interest rate on the external borrowings against a fixed interest rate. The interest rate cap limits the
variability of the interest rate.

The table below provides an overview of the notional amount and the fair value of the interest rate swaps
and the interest rate caps.

**_(ii) Early payment option on non-convertible bond_**

The Group has issued a EUR 35 million non-convertible bond in March 2015 as disclosed in borrowings
(please refer to Note 16 for more details). A derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to an
embedded derivative—the right for the issuer to exercise an early payment option with an early payment
penalty of either 2% or 1%, depending on the timing of exercise. As this option is not considered to be
closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized separately from the host
contract and has been measured at the fair value on initial recognition with subsequent changes in fair
value recorded in the income statement. At year-end 2015, a derivative financial asset of EUR 0.70 million
has been recognized. Upon early repayment, exercised in July 2016, the bond has been derecognized
through income statement, as well as the derivative asset, and any previously recognized deferred taxes.

The fair value of the derivative was measured as an intrinsic value of the derivative. This value is
determined with a reference to the relevant forward market interest rate by subtracting the fair value of
the liability without the option from the fair value of the liability if the option is exercised at the valuation
date including the indemnity (1%) to be paid. The market rates used were represented by zero-coupon
bonds based on the Euro Swap Curve plus the credit risk margin based on the BB and B composite US
credit curves as of the valuation date for each interest payment date. The effective yield to maturity used
for the valuation of derivatives at the end of 2015 was 6.0%.

**_(i)_** **_Classification as current trade receivables_**

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of
business. Trade receivables have varying due dates, a period of 0 - 90 days comprises the range for credit
terms. Therefore, they are classified as current asset. Trade receivables are recognized initially at the
amount of the consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components,
when they are recognized at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect
the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortized cost using the effective
interest method.

**_(ii) Transferred receivables_**

The carrying amounts of the trade receivables as per 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017 include
receivables which are subject to factoring arrangements. Under these arrangements, the Group has

F-227


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**12 Trade and other receivables (Continued)**

transferred the relevant receivables to the factor in exchange for cash and is prevented from selling or
pledging the receivables. The Group, however, has retained late payment risk and credit risk. The Group
therefore continues to recognize the transferred assets on its balance sheet. The Group considers the held
to collect business model to remain appropriate for these receivables and hence continues measuring these
receivables at amortized cost.

The amount of factored receivables amounts to EUR 25 million as per 31 December 2017 and
EUR 39 million as per 1 January 2016.

As from 2018 a new commercial finance agreement of EUR 50 million has been signed. As the late
payment risk and credit risk has been transferred to the counterparty, this agreement has been accounted
for as a non-recourse agreement. Hence this amount has been deducted from the open trade receivables as
per December 31, 2018.

**_(iii) Fair value of receivables_**

Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same
as their fair value.

**_(iv) Impairment and risk exposure_**

Information about the impairment of trade receivables and the Group’s exposure to credit risk can be
found in Note 5. As the Group is mainly active in the EURO-zone, there is no exposure to foreign
currency risk. There is also no exposure to price risk as the investments will be held to maturity.

**12.2 Other financial assets at amortized cost**

The group classifies its financial assets at amortized cost only if both of the following criteria are met:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and

- the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

Financial assets at amortized costs as per 31 December 2018 include:

**31 December** **31 December** **31 December** **1 January**
**Other financial assets at amortised cost** **2018** **2017** **2016** **2016**

**_(i)_** **_Loans to related parties as well as other receivables to related parties_**

Loans and other receivables outstanding to related parties mainly relate to loans as well as cash pool
arrangements that are in place between the Group and its joint ventures, TEC Alliance Group and the
Zaquensis Group for 2017 and 2016. As from 2018 the Group has full control over these entities.

Further information relating to loans to related parties is set out in Note 33.

**_(ii) Other non-current assets_**

The other non-current assets outstanding at year-end mainly relate to financial guarantees paid by the
Group for its ongoing lease contracts of branches and housing accommodation.

**_(iii) Other current receivables_**

The main amounts of other current receivables are related to amounts recoverable for VAT.

**_(iv) CICE receivable_**

CICE receivables arise from tax credits under the French Competitive Employment Act (CICE). This act
is aimed at improving the competitiveness of the French economy and at reducing the unemployment rate.
The tax credit is calculated as a percentage of wages and salaries paid to employees with a salary that is less
than 2.5 times the French minimum wage. The tax credit can be offset against the income tax liability
payable with respect to the calendar year to which the wages relate. Any excess credit on an annual basis
can be carried forward and offset against the tax liability during the next three years. The amount
accounted for as a current receivable is expected to be due in the following year.

**_(v) Fair values of other financial assets at amortized cost_**

Due to the short-term nature of the other current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be
the same as their fair value. For the majority of the non-current receivables, the fair values are also not
significantly different to their carrying amounts.

**_(vi) Impairment and risk exposure_**

The Group did not account any loss allowances on the other receivables. As the Group is mainly active in
the EURO-zone, there is no exposure to foreign currency risk. There is also no exposure to price risk as
the investments will be held to maturity.

**_(vii) Contract assets_**

Refer to note 22.2 and 22.3 with respect to this matter.

The weighted average applicable tax rate was 32% (31 December 2017: 34%, 31 December 2016: 31%).
Primary drivers that impacted the effective tax rates for 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the following:

**_(i)_** **_Adjustment in respect of prior years_**

The Group has been subject in 2017 to a tax audit on some of its Belgian operational entities. The Group
has fully cooperated with the authorities. By December 2017, a final settlement was agreed upon by the
Group and the Tax Authorities.

**_(ii) Expenses not deductible for income tax purposes_**

The recurring expenses not deductible for tax purposes include permanent differences such as expenses
which are non-deductible under local tax laws (e.g. car expenses and meal expenses).

The Group has offered to a selected group of managers share options on the shares of We are One BVBA,
a 100% subsidiary of HOHR having different grant dates. The Group also offers ratchet plans to the
managers of the different Group entities. These managers are often also minority shareholders in the
respective Group Companies.

At the end of 2017, the Board of the Group has decided to settle both the existing share option plan as well
as the ratchets in the context of the 2018 roll-over. The settlement of the share option plan was not
deductible for tax purposes. In 2018, a new option plan was executed at the level of the shareholders of
HOHR and has been accounted for as an employee benefit expense.

**_(iii) Re-measurement of deferred tax—change in domestic tax rates_**

The impact of the re-measurement of deferred taxes mainly relate to changes in the applicable income tax
rates in Belgium and the Netherlands.

The Belgian Corporate Income Tax regime has been modified by the Belgian Government by means of the
Corporate Income Tax Reform Act of 25 December 2017 (Official Gazette of 29 December 2017). This
reform includes a reduction of the corporate tax rate form 33,99% to 29,58% from the year ending
31 December 2018 with further reduction to 25% as from the year 31 December 2020. Further to the
Belgian tax reform, the use of certain deductions will be limited to EUR 1 million. Therefore, 30% of the
tax base in excess of EUR 1 million cannot be offset. The limitation applies to carried forward tax losses,
carried forward participation exemption, carried forward innovation deduction, as well as the new
incremental notional interest deduction.

As a result of the reform, Group management remeasured its deferred income tax balances. Deferred
income tax expected to be reversed in the year to 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2019 have been
measured using the effective rate that will apply in Belgium for the period (29,58%). Deferred income tax
expected to be reversed beyond 31 December 2019 have been measured with an effective rate of 25%.

Also the Corporate Income Tax regime in the Netherlands has been modified. This reform includes a
reduction of the corporate tax rate from 25% from the year ending 31 December 2018 and 2019 to 22,55%
from the year ending 31 December 2020, with a further decrease to 20,5% as from the year ending
31 December 2021.

The impact of this change in the tax rate has been recognized in the tax expense in profit and loss except to
the extent that it relates to items previously recognized outside of profit and loss. For the Group these
items are limited to the translation of foreign operations using a different presentation currency as the one
applied by the Group.

**_(iv) Taxes computed on another basis_**

The amounts for which taxes are calculated using another basis fully relate to the capital gains realized by
the Group on the sale of the shares of the TEC entities in August 2016. At that moment, realized capital
gains on the sale of shares in Belgium are taxed at 0.412% instead of the normal income tax percentage of
33,99%.

**_(v) Unrecognized income tax assets_**

The Group decided not to recognize additional deferred income tax assets on losses carried forward in
some of its entities as the Group believes that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is not probable.

The majority of the unrecognized deferred income tax losses relates to the House of HR NV, the entity on
which the Corporate projects are performed that are applicable for the total group.

**_(vi) Gain on equity investment_**

The Group has acquired full control in 2018 over its joint ventures Zaquensis and TEC. A surplus value
has been accounted for on these shares for which no deferred income tax is applicable.

**13.3 Deferred taxes**

Using the balance sheet liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to provide for
temporary differences between the value of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
for tax purposes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same tax jurisdiction.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at year-end and
which are expected to apply in the coming years when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized
or settled. The analysis of the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities is as follows:

**13 Income tax (Continued)**

Deferred income tax assets are recognized for tax losses carried forward, excluding unused notional
interest deduction (NID), to the extent that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable, i.e. in those companies where, based on business projections over a period of
10 years, the company estimates that the losses can be utilized within this timeframe.

The Group did not recognize deferred income taxes for:

The cash and cash equivalents disclosed above and in the statement of cash flows include EUR 4.9 million
of restricted cash (31 December 2017: EUR 4.0 million, 31 December 2016: EUR 3.4 million and
1 January 2016: EUR 2.9 million). These deposits are subject to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands
(system of G-accounts containing amounts for taxes to be paid on salaries) and are therefore not available
for general use by the other entities within the Group.

As indicated in Note 16 on the borrowings, the Group’s current and future cash and cash equivalents are
pledged as security for these borrowings. The entire amount of the Group’s bank borrowings and accrued
interest are secured according to collective pledge agreements.

Since the Groups transition date to IFRS, the following changes in the paid-in capital have taken place:

- _Changes in equity structure in 2016_

During 2016, the ordinary share capital has increased by EUR 54.70 million following the issue of
53.80 million shares with a par value between EUR 1 and EUR 1.03. The capital increase was partially
completed by means of a contribution in cash (EUR 47.56 million). The remaining increase of EUR 7.14
results from the conversion into equity of debt instruments that were outstanding to FPCI Naxicap
Opportunities II, Pro-Manage BVBA, Burgerlijke Vennootschap Conny Vandendriessche-Wim
Vanhaelemeersch Pro-Manage.

- _Changes in equity structure in 2017_

The 2016 convertible note issued by the Company, that at the option of the Group was convertible into
ordinary shares, has been converted into ordinary shares on 11 December 2017. As a result of the
conversion, the number of shares and share capital increased by 186.32 thousand shares and
EUR 187.22 million respectively.

as well as the current portion of long-term borrowings.

**_(i)_** **_Borrowings_**

- Bank borrowings

The bank borrowings as at 1st January 2016 relate to various bank loans obtained locally by the subsidiaries
from local banks. In June 2016, these loans were repaid and replaced by new bank loans following the
signature of a Senior Facility Agreement (SFA) at Corporate level, that bear variable interest rates. The
nominal amount of the amounts drawn under the SFA as per 31 December 2016, net of transaction costs,
was EUR 307.7 million. The drawings had a maturity of 5 years and a variable interest rate based on
Euribor plus a fixed margin. During December 2017, these bank loans were refinanced with a new Senior
Facility Agreement at the Corporate level, also with variable interest rates. The carrying amount of the
drawings, net of transaction cost, was EUR 456.9 million. The drawings as per 31 December 2017 had
7 years of maturity and a variable interest rate based on Euribor plus a margin. In March 2018, the
additional tranche of EUR 125 million was withdrawn under the same terms.

All these loans were initially measured at fair value, with subsequent measurement at amortized cost.

- Non-convertible bond

Besides these bank loans, an EUR 35 million non-convertible bond has been issued by Accent to the
reference shareholders in March 2015, with a payable coupon of 4.5%, an annual interest rate to be
capitalized of 3.5%, and maturity of 7 years. This bond has been initially measured at fair value based on
the discounted cash flow method at the prevailing market interest rate, which resulted in a day one loss of
EUR 1.9 million, recorded in the other reserves and an amount of EUR 0.5 million as a derivative. The
bond was subsequently measured at amortized cost and has been accruing interest until its repayment date
in July 2016. A derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to the right for the issuer to
exercise an early payment option with an early payment penalty of either 2% or 1%, depending on the
timing of exercise. As this option is not considered to be closely related to the host contract, a derivative
asset has been recognized separately from the host contract and has been measured at the fair value on
initial recognition with subsequent measurement at year-end 2015 through profit or loss. At year-end 2015,

F-238

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**16 Borrowings (Continued)**

a financial liability of EUR 38.7 million was recognized, as well as a derivative asset of EUR 0.7 million
and related deferred tax asset of EUR 0.6 million.

- Vendor loans

Vendor loans at 1st January 2016 mostly relate to loans provided by the reference shareholders as at
23rd December 2015, with a nominal amount of EUR 180 million, an annual interest of 2% and maturity
of 7.5 years. The loan was initially measured at the fair value based on the discounted cash flow method
and the prevailing market interest rate. Initial measurement resulted in a fair value of EUR 143 million
and a day one gain of EUR 37 million which was recorded in retained earnings. A corresponding deferred
tax liability of EUR 12.6 million was recognized. Subsequently, this vendor loan was measured at
amortized cost until the extinguishment in May 2016, when the loan was partially repaid and partially
converted to a convertible bond issued in the same month. On extinguishment, one portion of the vendor
loan was derecognized and paid out, and the other portion was converted into a convertible bond, as
indicated further below. A financial loss of EUR 8 million was recognized upon derecognition as a
difference between paid amount and net book value of derecognized portion of the loan.

An additional vendor loan of EUR 5 million was provided by shareholders of Continu in 2015 and is
measured at amortized cost.

An additional vendor loan note amounting to EUR 17.4 million issued in 2017 has been converted in the
same year.

In 2018 a vendor loan of EUR 3.5 million was provided by shareholders of Covebo.

- Convertible bonds

Convertible bonds recognized in 2016 relate to four issuances of the bonds that occurred during May,
October and November 2016. The bonds were issued to the various shareholders for a total nominal
amount of EUR 187.2 million, with an annual interest rate of 2%, and maturity until June 2023. About
84% was subscribed through a conversion of the vendor loan, as disclosed above, and the remaining 16%
was contributed in cash. The vendor loan has been remeasured at fair value upon conversion and a
financial loss of EUR 11 million was recognized upon conversion, as shown further in the movement table
below. Upon conversion of the vendor loan to convertible bonds and additional subscriptions to bonds in
cash, the convertible bonds have been split into two components: a liability (measured as the net present
value of the future cash flows discounted at the market interest rate of a similar bond without conversion
option) and a residual equity component. The liability component has been further measured at amortized
cost. As a consequence, at year-end 2016, a financial liability of EUR 167.2 million was recognized, a
deferred tax liability of EUR 7.5 million and an equity component of EUR 7.2 million (EUR 4.7 million
net of deferred tax).

Just before the year-end 2017, the convertible bonds have been converted into equity at the conversion
rate of 1 share for 1 bond (except for the latest bond issuance in November with a rate of 1.0350275). The
carrying amount of liability component was reclassified to equity at conversion through an increase of
share capital equal to the value of issued shares, with the difference between the value of issued share
capital and the sum of the carrying amount of liability and equity component being recognized as a
decrease in other reserves of EUR 11.3 million. Deferred taxes have been released through retained

earnings resulting in an increase in other reserves of EUR 4.2 million. The interest due at conversion date
of the bond in the amount of EUR 4.8 million was converted to equity after a few months in 2018.

- Shareholder’s loans

Shareholder’s loans mostly relate to long term loans provided in 2015 to Covebo and Continu by minority
shareholders. These balances have decreased over the years 2016 and 2017 due to repayments made and
were fully settled in 2018. An additional short-term loan was provided in 2017 and has been fully settled in
2018 as well. In 2018, a new shareholders loan has been provided to Vialegis Group.

- Subordinated loans on preference shares

Subordinated loans on preference shares relate to preferential dividends declared before year-end 2017
and 2016 for an amount of EUR 5.3 million and EUR 1.3 million respectively, which was agreed to be paid
out only at the later date and was treated as a loan at the moment.

- Current borrowings

Current borrowings relate to the current portion of bank loans and shareholder’s loan payable within one
year after the year-end date, and also to the liability for factoring (EUR 39 million at year-end 2015, and
EUR 25 million at year-end 2017). Refer to credit risk Note 5 for more details on factoring accounting
policy. Factoring agreements were not in place as of year-end 2016, therefore there is no liability for that
period.

The main movements relate to obtained new borrowings from the banks in 2016, which were repaid in
2017 and refinanced by the new bank borrowings (EUR 475 million nominal amount), as previously
disclosed in this note. During 2018, an additional amount (EUR 125 million nominal amount) has been
drawn from the SFA. For the transactions related to the convertible bond, please refer to disclosures
previously made in this note (2016: fair value measurement of the vendor loan converted to convertible
bond of EUR 11 million and recognition of equity portion of EUR 7.2 million; and 2017: reclassification of
liability portion to equity on conversion of bonds to share capital of EUR 168.8 million). During 2018, as
part of the roll-over (note 4.5), some of the loans payable towards third party have been contributed in
kind.

**16 Borrowings (Continued)**

- Significant assumptions taken for the fair value calculations at initial measurement

Vendor loans, non-convertible and convertible bonds have been initially measured at fair value, and
subsequently accounted for at amortized cost. The fair value was estimated by calculating the present value
of the future expected cash flows. The estimates are based on a discount rate which approximates the
market interest rate for the similar instrument on the market. Judgement is required in determining this
market rate. The Group determined the credit risk of the company based on the interest rate for the bank
loan that the Group has obtained during the year, adjusted for the risk-free rate of the Eurozone prevalent
on the market at issue. Based on the credit risk determined above, credit margin was estimated as based on
the BB and B USD composite curve. Total discount rate was estimated as a Euro Swap Curve plus the
credit margin estimated above at the date of valuation.

For the majority of the borrowings, the fair values are not materially different to their carrying amounts,
since the interest payable on those borrowings is either close to current market rates or the borrowings are
of a short-term nature. The biggest difference in the table below is for the bank loans and it is due to paid
transactions costs that are reflected in the net book value, under the amortized cost method.

**_(iii) Financial covenants_**

Under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Group is required to comply with the financial
covenant that the leverage ratio must be not more than 6.0:1.

The Group has complied with this covenant throughout the reporting period. As at 31 December 2018, the
leverage ratio of the group (net debt to EBITDA) was 2.73:1 (2.9:1 as at 31 December 2017).

**_(iv) Collateral for the Group’s bank borrowings_**

For the bank loans in place in years 2018, 2017 and 2016 (SFA loan agreements), multiple pledge
agreements have been entered into which collectively secure the bank borrowings for the entire amount
outstanding and accrued interest on the bank borrowings. The Group is subject to regular bank reporting,
and leverage is monitored. In the event of a default of repayment of the bank borrowings and related
interest payments, the pledgee may enforce against the pledged assets. During the period under review,
there was no default of the payment obligations.

The present and future assets pledged as collateral include the following:

- All of the shares of the HOHR and material subsidiaries,

- All bank accounts of the HOHR and material subsidiaries;

- All of the intercompany receivables of the Group and material subsidiaries (including cash pooling
arrangements for SFA signed in 2016 and excluding cash pooling for SFA signed in 2017).

At year-end 2016, all pledge agreements were in place for SFA signed in 2016. These pledges were released
in December 2017, due to a new SFA signed at that moment. At year-end 2017, only a few pledge
agreements were in place for SFA signed in December 2017, as remaining pledge agreements were mostly
signed in March 2018, in line with the allowed 90 days period for ensuring pledges are in place. These
pledges remain valid until the year-end 2018.

**_(i)_** **_Provisions for dismantling obligations_**

The Group signed a number of lease contracts for branches and headquarters in which mandatory
dismantling obligations exist. The amount accrued represents the net present value of the estimated
cash-outflows that the Group expects to incur upon termination of the contract to dismantle all leasehold
improvements made to the leased properties. The total costs as per 31 December 2018 for dismantling the
leasehold improvements amount to EUR 0.56 million (31 December 2017: EUR 0.57 million,
31 December 2016: EUR 0.54 million, 1 January 2016: EUR 0.49 million).

**_(ii) Provisions for litigations_**

The amount represents provisions for certain legal claims brought against the Group by former staff
members. The provision charge is recognized in the income statement within the ‘‘Other general and
administrative expenses’’. The amount recognized as per 31 December 2018 for litigations is expected to be
used in 2019 and 2020. Management’s view is that the outcome of these legal claims will not give rise to any
significant loss beyond the amounts provided for at 31 December 2018.

**18.1 Short-term employee benefits**

The amount of short-term employee benefits outstanding at the reporting date mainly relate to unpaid
salaries and wages as well as the related taxes on these amounts. The amounts both relate to salaries and
wages for temping staff as well as the permanent staff that is working for the Group. Furthermore, the
ratchet schemes for Continu and Covebo are accounted for under the short-term employee benefits
(EUR 11.57 million for 2017, EUR 0.59 million for 2016 and EUR 0.14 million as per January 1, 2016).

**18.2 Post-employment employee benefits**

**_(i)_** **_Pension plans_**

The Group offers a number of defined contribution plans to its employees. Because of the Belgian
legislation applicable to the second pillar pension plans (the so-called ‘‘Law Vandenbroucke’’), all Belgian
pension plans that are structured as defined contribution plans are considered defined benefit plans under
IFRS. Because of this minimum guaranteed return, the Group is exposed to a financial risk since further
contributions could be required if the return on the assets is not sufficient to reach the minimum benefits
to be paid. The Group has plans that are financed through insurance contracts. The Group carefully
reviewed the different pension plans at the different reporting periods and concluded that the application
of the projected unit credit method to calculate the defined benefit obligation would not result in a
material amount to be accounted for on the statement of financial position. No similar minimum funding
exists in other countries where the Group is active.

The Group does not provide any material defined benefit plans to its employees.

**_(ii) Disability benefits_**

The Group also provides disability benefits to its employees which have similar terms and conditions as the
defined contribution plans and therefore also have to be accounted for in a similar way. As the Group is
insured for these disability benefits, no provision has been accounted for by the Group.

**18.3 Other long-term employee benefits**

Amounts reported for under the Other long-term employee benefits fully relate to jubilee premiums
offered by The Group rewarding employees for long years of service. The Group also provides sickness
compensations to its staff in the Netherlands.

The impact of the remeasurements on the outstanding jubilee premium is accounted for in the statement
of financial performance.

**_(ii) Termination benefits_**

The Group has no material outstanding termination benefits since 1 January 2016.

**19 Share-based payments**

The share-based payments consist of the option plan ‘‘We are One’’ offered to the management of Accent,
several Ratchet Schemes, offered to the key management of the different acquired subsidiaries (Abylsen,
Covebo, Continu, Timepartner, Zaquensis & TEC Alliance) and the new long-term incentive plan on the
level of the shareholders of HOHR.

**_(a) Share option plan ‘‘We are one’’_**

The Group has offered to a selected Group of managers share options on the shares of We are One
BVBA, a 100% subsidiary of HOHR, in order to incentivize them to further develop the activities of
HOHR. The loyalty call option can only be exercised upon exit, or in the context of a refinancing or an
extra-ordinary leaver event. The beneficiary has a put option to sell to HOHR the share options he has
bought at fair value of the share option upon exit. The share options are considered, given the put option
held by the beneficiary, as cash settled and accounted for as liabilities.

There have been 3 different grant dates for the share options, being in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The share
options each vest over a 3-year period, in accordance with the underlying vesting scheme.

Until 2 July 2023, the grantor commits not to transfer any share option to any other person than the key
manager. The grantor also commits that no distributions will be made.

Should no exit occur before 1 July 2023 and should the call option not be exercised in the context of a
refinancing put option, an extra-ordinary leaver put option or a key manager non-exit put option, then the
call option will lapse on 2 July 2023.

In case of an extraordinary leaver or good leaver event, the beneficiary keeps the options already vested. In
case of a bad leaver event, all options are cancelled, whether already vested or not.

- Fair value of options at 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016

The options are granted for no consideration. The fair value is independently determined using an
adjusted form of the Black Scholes which includes a Monte Carlo simulation model that takes into account
the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution (where material), the share price at grant
date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield, the risk free interest
rate for the term of the option and the correlations and volatilities of the peer Group companies. The
expected price volatility is based on the historic volatility (based on the remaining life of the options),
adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.

- Settlement of the plan

At the end of 2017, the Board has decided to settle the existing share option plan in the context of the 2018
roll-over. The share option plan has been settled partially in cash (EUR 40.3 million) and partially through
the issuance of new shares at the level of HOHR (EUR 12.9 million).

**_(b) Ratchet schemes_**

The company offers ratchet plans to the managers of the different Group entities (TimePartner,
Zaquensis, Covebo, Continu, TEC Alliance and Abylsen). These managers are often also minority
shareholders in the respective Group Companies.

The ratchet consists of a premium that will be paid out to the holders of the ratchet upon exit by the main
shareholder. The ratchet premium consists of 25% of the excess return realized by the THOHR upon exit.
The ratchet is determined separately at the level of the respective Group companies. The ratchet premium
realized for a specific Group company should then be split amongst the different ratchet—holders in
accordance with the relevant articles in the entity’s shareholder agreement or entity’s management
agreement of the relevant Group company.

_b.1) Ratchet schemes per group_

- _Continu_

Several managers (B-shareholders) of the entity ‘‘Continu Holding BV’’ are entitled to a management
incentive program. An element of that incentive program is the payment of a ratchet-payment. In case of
an Exit or Sale of shares, the Employee (‘‘Manager’’) will receive a compensation, which is based on the
return achieved by the Group on its initial investment in the entity. From the amount, that exceeds 2.5
times the initial investment made by the Group, 25% will be reserved to be paid as a Ratchet to the
different B-shareholders. The Ratchet premium will be allocated based on the relative number of B-shares
held by the beneficiaries (minority shareholders). The Grant date of the Ratchet is 14/09/2015.

- _TimePartner_

The same principle applies to the TimePartner Group Service GmbH (Timepartner). The Group acquired
the Time Partner entities in 2016. Next to the shareholder agreement, a ratchet agreement has also been
signed between the HOHR, the Managers of Company A and Company B. The same principle applies as
for Continu BV: 25% of the excess return which is realized by the HOHR on its investment with HOHR
Holding Germany, will be reserved and paid out to the beneficiaries of the ratchet plan upon exit of sale.
This excess return can be realized in the context of an Exit event, which is defined as either an IPO by
HOHR or Accent Jobs for People NV, a sale of the shares of HOHR Holding Germany GmbH, a sale of
HOHR or a sale of Accent Jobs for People NV to a bona fide third party. The beneficiaries of the ratchet
mechanism for Timepartner are the minority shareholders (sellers), management Company A and
management Company B, and potential future co-investors, acting in their capacity as company managers.
The ratchet has been allocated to Managers Company A (2/5), Managers Company B (1/5) and
Co-investors (2/5). The grant date of the ratchet is 30 November 2016 for Managers A & B and 23 January
2017 for the co-investors. The contract also foresees specific provisions in case of good leaver/bad leaver
events.

- _Zaquensis_

The Shareholder agreement provides a similar ratchet mechanism. In case of an IPO (of Accent Jobs for
People NV, Accent Group NV or HOHR NV), or a sale (of the shares of Accent Jobs for People NV,
Accent Group NV or HOHR NV), Accent Jobs for People NV shall pay to Z-Holding an exit premium
(ratchet premium) equal to 25% of the amount which exceeds the minimum return realized by Accent Jobs
for People NV in respect of its investment in Zaquensis.

- _TEC Alliance_

The holders of C shares shall be entitled to receive an additional return on their investment in class C
shares to the extent such parties are still holders of C shares at such time at charge of the holders of class B
shares. This additional return (ratchet) is equal to 25% of the surplus proceeds (the ratchet). The surplus
proceeds upon exit represent the amount exceeding 2.5 times its total investment in the Group as from
closing date. The grant date of the ratchet is 31 August 2016.

- _Covebo_

The management team of Covebo (C-shareholders) will receive a ratchet premium upon exit, which is
equal to 25% of the excess return upon exit. The Ratchet was granted on 24 June 2015.

- _Abylsen_

For Abylsen, management contract also foresees in the pay out of a Ratchet in case of an exit, which was
granted on 25 March 2015.

_b.3) Fair value of ratchets at 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016_

The ratchets are granted for no consideration and vested based on the expected date of exit. The fair value
is independently determined using an adjusted form of the Black Scholes Model which includes a Monte
Carlo simulation model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the ratchet, the impact of
dilution (where material), the share price at grant date and the expected price volatility of the underlying
share, the expected dividend yield, the risk free interest rate for the term of the ratchet and the
correlations and volatilities of the peer Group companies. The expected price volatility is based on the
historic volatility (based on the remaining life of the ratchets), adjusted for any expected changes to future
volatility due to publicly available information.

**_(c) Long term incentive plan_**

The Group launched a share-based payment plan throughout 2018 offering the management team to
participate in the long-term incentive plan. The purpose of the plan is to create an incentive for members
of management and executives of the Group who can make an important contribution to the success and
the growth of the Group, to help the Group retaining and attracting managers with the necessary
experience and skills, and to align the interests of those managers with the grantors’ interests as
shareholders of the Company and give them the opportunity to share in the value creation and growth of
the Group.

The share options are granted free of charge at the grant date, i.e. 28 August 2018. The exercise price of
the options is equal to the current fair market value of the shares (EUR 2.17).

The term of the options runs from the grant date until 28 June 2023 for Belgian tax residents (5 years
maximum vesting period). For other beneficiaries, the term of validity is maximum 10 years.

The plan is settled in the ordinary shares of the Company. The option holder may exercise the options
subject to the occurrence of an exit event, a non-exit event or a good leaver event.

The plan contains a number of vesting conditions:

a) Service conditions—the beneficiary should have contractual relationship with the group at the
vesting date (in case of an exit or a non-exit event) or qualify as a good leaver (in case of a good
leaver event);

b) Performance conditions—the number of options that vest (and can be exercised) is determined at
the vesting date and depend on the return (or a deemed return) of the grantors on the initial
value (effectively the increase in the fair value of the shares of the group since 31/12/2017).

**22 Revenues (Continued)**

The Group mainly generates revenue from offering temporary staffing solutions to its customers. The
duration of these temporary staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two
years (without minimum volumes attached to these contracts).

The Group also provides solutions to customers active in larger project-oriented businesses (such as the
telecom or the construction industry) where apart from staffing also specific deliverables have to be
provided for. Projects may take one week up to two to three months. The Group does not have a single
major customer from which it generates revenue.

**22.2 Assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers**

The Group has recognized the following contract assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers:

**31 December** **31 December** **31 December** **1 January**

**22.3 Assets recognized from costs to fulfill contracts**

The Group obtained control over the TEC entities as from 1 January 2018. TEC entities are specialized in
projects designing, constructing and maintaining telecommunications infrastructure. At the start of these
projects the Group often incurs costs to fulfill their obligations under its contracts. These costs are
incurred before the services are delivered to the customers. These fulfillment costs mainly include direct
labor (e.g. salaries of employees working on these projects) and direct materials (e.g. materials used to
construct the infrastructure). As per end of 2018, the Group recognized an amount EUR 1,3 million of
costs to fulfill contracts costs.

These costs incurred can be recovered from the customers. These costs to fulfill a contract are amortized
on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods and services to which these
assets relate.

The Group has created together with Marc Rummens a new holding company called TEC Alliance NV as
per 31 August 2016. Both shareholders into this holding company contributed to the business of the
holding by transferring the shares they held in Logi-Technic business (contributed by the Group) and HCG
business (contributed by Marc Rummens). The aggregate amount relative to the contribution value of the
Logi-Technic shares amounted to EUR 27.7 million. The Group realized a gain on the contribution of the
Logi-Technic business into the newly created holding of EUR 17.93 million. The remaining amount of
EUR 2.3 million relates to the sale of HomeMaid NV.

An amount of EUR 7.25 million was received as a reimbursement for a claim that was filed against the
company throughout 2017.

During 2018 it was decided to transfer the ratchet payable towards Abylsen from HOHR to the
shareholders of HOHR, resulting in a reversal of the provision of EUR 6.62 million.

As from 2018, full control was acquired over the TEC Group and Zaquensis Group (cf. note 4). HOHR
has remeasured the previously held interest at fair value and has recognized the resultant gain in profit for
an amount of EUR 24.30 million.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**29 Finance income and costs (Continued)**

Refinancing costs and bank fees of EUR 10 million for 2017 relate to costs to obtain the bank loans that
were paid in 2016 for the SFA signed in June 2016. These costs were capitalized and included in the
amortized cost of the loans. However, a new SFA agreement was signed in 2017 which replaced the SFA
from 2016, which were paid out. Consequently, the capitalized costs were released to income statement in
2017 upon extinguishment of the 2016 SFA. The refinancing costs for the new SFA of 2017 are gradually
released to P&L over the lifetime of the loan (EUR 3.18 million for 2018).
