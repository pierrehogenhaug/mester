131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.3,Historical Financial Information,4.3.2,Comparability of the Financial Statements,"_Changes to Reportable Segments_ Prior to 2021, we structured our business and our reporting across three segments: engineering and consulting, specialized staffing and general staffing. In the first quarter of 2021, we integrated our legacy specialized staffing and general staffing segments into the current specialized talent solutions segment. This integration involved the partial merger between TIMEPARTNER and Zaquensis in the second quarter of 2021 through the creation of a new holding company, House of HR Germany GmbH, which holds all shares in the TIMEPARTNER and Zaquensis entities. The former holding companies, TIMEPARTNER Group Service GmbH and Zaquensis Holding GmbH, are shareholders of House of HR Germany GmbH. The assets and liabilities of these holding companies have been hived down to House of HR Germany GmbH. House of HR’s management believes that this segment reporting also reflects better the strategy of House of HR towards becoming even more specialized in the Human Resources solutions market. The ultimate purpose of the integration of these two segments is to better focus on how to attract candidates and present our services to our client base. As a result, since the first quarter of 2021, we have presented our results in two segments: engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions. Our financial information by segment for 2021 and any subsequent period is therefore not directly comparable to the financial information by segment presented in our 2020 Audited Financial Statements, or for any prior period. We present the financial information by segment under the new structure in this Offering Memorandum. Our financial information for the specialized talent solutions segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 represent the sum of the results of the legacy specialized staffing and general staffing segments. As a result, such information may not be directly comparable with the information included in our 2020 Financial Statements. See note 6 to our 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. _Acquisitions and Disposals_ During the periods under review, we have made several acquisitions which have impacted our consolidation perimeter. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Statements— Acquisitions, Disposals and the Comparability of our Financial Statements” for the list of businesses_ that we have acquired during the periods under review. Acquired businesses are generally consolidated from the date of their acquisition and the full impact of an acquisition is only reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the subsequent financial year. Additionally, we completed the disposal of GRITT Projects in June 2020 as its business model was not aligned with our overall strategy and was not delivering the expected performance, which resulted in a total loss of €19.6 million being recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020. See note 3.1 to each of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As a result, our consolidated financial information may not be comparable following the date of such acquisition or divestments. _Impact of Covid-19_ The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our operations limits the comparability of our results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 with our results as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2021, and may impact comparability with future periods. See “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of Covid-19.”_ ----- _Impact of the Transactions_ The Acquisition was completed on November 3, 2022. See “Summary—The Transactions.” None of the financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. We will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations). The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets that may be added to the balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brands, rights of use, contractual rights with franchisees leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Only certain limited as adjusted financial data of the Issuer is presented as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the Notes offered hereby. In addition, in connection with the Acquisition, French Bidco, a direct subsidiary of the Issuer, acquired 70.8% of the share capital of Nowjobs France II SAS from a subsidiary of House of HR and 100% of the share capital of ABY Engineering SAS, which in turn acquired 99.97% of the share capital of NewCo Abylsen SAS from a subsidiary of House of HR. Subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date, the results of these entities will no longer be consolidated into the results of House of HR. See “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.” In the future, we may report our consolidated financial condition and results of operations at the level of the Issuer, or at another entity, rather than at House of HR.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.4,Business Unit Accounts,4.4.1,,"Certain financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been presented on the basis of the unaudited accounts of our business units (the “business unit accounts”). Certain of these business unit accounts may include information from statutory audited accounts, but they are not covered by the audit reports included in this Offering Memorandum and were prepared on a different basis from our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The business unit accounts assume that any acquisitions undertaken that are reported with that business unit were acquired as of January 1, 2019 and that any divestments of business units were divested as of January 1, 2019 so that the management of our business units can track the performance of the enlarged business unit post-acquisition on the same basis. Acquisitions may take several months to integrate into the business unit accounts. Furthermore, the management of our business units are responsible for identifying normalizations that should be reflected in the business unit accounts, both in the statutory information that is integrated from acquisitions and after such acquisition, as well as within the existing business units operation. We believe our approach on the preparation of our business accounts facilitates management’s ability to track its key performance indicators, since the impact of acquisitions and normalizations that occur are eliminated. Financial information prepared on this basis has been referred to as business unit accounts or Pro Forma business unit accounts in this Offering Memorandum. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and _Industry—We have included certain historical financial information on entities that we acquired, which_ ----- _were not prepared by us or reviewed by our auditors and in some instances, which were not audited at all, or which were prepared on a different basis from our current IFRS financial statements, which may not be reflective of our past performance or representative of our future results.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Certain of these figures set out in this Offering Memorandum have been computed by adding the revenues of all of our acquired entities to our historical statutory accounts (prepared from 2008 to 2015 on a Belgian GAAP basis), to present the total revenues of House of HR, as if it had been operating as a consolidated group at the relevant date. See “Business—Our Strengths— _Outstanding performance throughout the cycle demonstrating highly resilient profile” for further_ information. The historical financial metrics for the acquired entities have been obtained from their individual accounts, and are therefore not comparable to House of HR’s historical financial information. Some of these accounts may not have been prepared in accordance with statutory requirements or the accounting policies used by these acquired entities, and they may differ in substantial respects from the manner in which we have prepared our accounts. This financial information may not reflect what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had House of HR operated as a consolidated group or reporting segment during the periods presented. A number of estimates, judgments and assumptions were made for the purpose of allocating those items that were not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. This financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily indicate what House of HR’s results of operations would have been had we operated as a consolidated entity in the past with House of HR’s current consolidation perimeter, nor do they purport to represent our future financial condition or results of operations.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.8,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,4.8.2,,"In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of the Financial Statements or in the footnotes thereto. The primary non-IFRS financial measures used in this Offering Memorandum include EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, _Pro Forma_ Management Adjusted Revenue, Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, M&A capital expenditure, capital expenditures (excluding M&A capital expenditures), net capital expenditures, Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow, Gross Margin, Organic Growth, Like-for-Like Revenue and Like-for-Like EBITDA and certain leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures. Such nonIFRS measures and ratios may not reflect accurately our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur debt and should not be considered as a substitute to net result or any other performance measures derived from or in accordance with IFRS, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as a substitute to net cash from/(used in) operating activities. The financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. As used in this Offering Memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings: - “EBITDA” represents operating profit/(loss) plus the income statement line items for depreciation and amortization, goodwill impairment, royalties and extraordinary items. The income statement line items net change in depreciation, amortization and impairment include, among others, depreciation of tangible assets, provisions for operational risks, disputes, pensions, bad debt, overdue receivables, if any. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to operating profit/(loss) for the period, see footnote (2) under “Summary—Summary Consolidated _Financial and Other Information— Summary Consolidated Other Financial and Pro Forma Information.”_ - “EBITDA cash” represents EBITDA less lease payments. - “EBITDA margin” represents EBITDA divided by revenue. - “Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue” represents the revenue for the period presented adjusted to reflect revenue generated by businesses acquired or divested during that period as if those acquisitions or divestments had occurred on the first day of the period; therefore, the consolidation perimeter for each period presented is different. - “Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA” represents EBITDA as adjusted for the items set forth in “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary _Consolidated Other Financial and Pro Forma Information.” The consolidation perimeter for_ each period presented is different as described below under “—Organic Growth, Like-for-Like _and Pro Forma Historical Information of the Company.”_ - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” represents Like-for-Like EBITDA as further adjusted for the items set forth in “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information— _Summary Consolidated Other Financial and Pro Forma Information.” The consolidation_ ----- perimeter for each period is presented on the same basis as described below under “—Organic _Growth, Like-for-Like and Pro Forma Historical Information of the Company.”_ - “Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow” represents EBITDA cash less capital expenditures plus cash flow from working capital changes. - “Gross Margin” represents gross profit/(loss) divided by revenue. - “Organic Growth” represents revenue growth between one financial period and the comparable prior period, excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue as follows: (a) in respect of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (compared against the nine months ended September 30, 2021), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2021; (b) in respect of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 (compared against the year ended December 31, 2020), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2020; and (c) in respect of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 (compared against the year ended December 31, 2019), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019 or that divestments have taken place as of January 1, 2019. - “Like-for-Like Revenue” represents revenue adjusted to reflect our consolidation perimeter as of a certain period as if such perimeter had been in place at the beginning of such relevant period as described further under “—Organic Growth, Like-for-Like and Pro Forma Historical _Information of the Company” below._ - “Like-for-Like EBITDA” represent EBITDA adjusted to reflect our consolidation perimeter as of a certain period as if such perimeter had been in place at the beginning of each such relevant period as described further under “—Organic Growth, Like-for-Like and Pro Forma Historical _Information of the Company” below._ - “Capital expenditures” represents expenditures relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. - “Net capital expenditures” represents capital expenditures including proceeds from property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. - “M&A capital expenditures” represents capital expenditures relating to paid consideration, adjustments to purchase price and/or earn-outs for acquisition of subsidiaries (net of cash acquired), settlement with shareholders, buy-out minorities and for acquisition of equity investments, joint ventures and associates (net of cash acquired). We present non-IFRS measures for information purposes only. There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations for Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA and Pro _Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions, including, in the case of_ _Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA, successful implementation of certain initiatives and management or sponsor estimates. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent auditors’ firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. ----- We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt, and that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue or net result for the period or any other performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as a substitute to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. EBITDA and its variants as presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies and from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained and defined in the section entitled “Description of the Notes” of this Offering Memorandum and in the Indenture. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer, see “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary Consolidated _Other Financial and Pro Forma Information.”_ The non-IFRS measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under the Indenture. Some of the limitations of these non-IFRS measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; - they may include adjustments for non-cash items and not adjust for all items that impact cash flows; - some of the items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, such metrics should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. In addition, any of our historical financial information does not take into account any purchase price accounting or other adjustments to give effect to the Transactions and our indebtedness will not be comparable to our indebtedness following the Transactions. See “—Historical _Financial Information—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Impact of the Transactions” above_ and “Capitalization.” You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only as supplemental measures to evaluate the Group’s performance.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.9,Key Performance Indicators,4.9.1,,"Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements or accounting records, and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or experts. A number of our key performance indicators relate to our business units. Our business units are comprised of a variety of legal entities which are designated as a business unit by us, typically on the basis of a common (i) management team; (ii) financial reporting unit; and (iii) market specialization, which may include common specializations, international recruitment network approaches, end-markets served or geographical presence. Our business units are those presented in the tables in “Business—Our Service Offering—Two Staffing Segments and Digital” in this Offering Memorandum. Our use or computation of these terms may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of these terms should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS. Our primary key performance indicators are defined as follows: - “Bench time” represents the time for which job candidates are paid by us but cannot be billed to a client linked to the unavailability of an assignment. Such time does not include any hours linked to holiday, internal training or other matters. This also does not include any hours for job candidates that were on the bench, but that were fully compensated by furlough measures of the government. Bench time is expressed as an FTE using the working days per month multiplied by eight hours per day; - “Unique clients” for a period represents the sum of the number of our clients for each of the operational entities that formed part of the consolidation perimeter as of the end of the period. There may be duplication in the figures if different operational entities serve the same client or if a client has multiple legal entities under which it does business and which are served by us; - “In-house full-time equivalent employees” represent our employees that are not intended for client assignments, such as our sales and marketing in-house employees. Full-time equivalent measures the number of in-house employees as adjusted to reflect the portion of hours worked in a period. An in-house employee on a 40-hour work week would represent one in-house fulltime equivalent employee for the period whereas an in-house employee on a 20-hour work week would represent 0.5 full-time equivalent employee for the period; - “Job candidates” include, for the relevant period, our individuals that we recruit for assignments with clients, whether they be for temporary staffing positions, secondments or consulting roles. Job candidates also refers to our engineers and consultants, freelancers and subcontractors that are intended for assignments with clients; - “Job candidates at work” or “people at work” represent any job candidate that has worked one hour at a client during the period indicated. Job candidates at work include our engineers and ----- consultants, freelancers and subcontractors as well as job candidates with an indefinite or temporary employment agreement with us (whether or not they worked one hour with a client during the applicable period); - “Productive job candidates” or “productive people at work” represent job candidates working at the customer premises, expressed in full time equivalents; - “Total Market” represents the estimated total market size in 2021 expressed in terms of revenue, which encompassed the staffing market in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France; - “Addressable Market” represents the portion of our Total Market which has been narrowed down to reflect the estimated market size, expressed in terms of revenue, for each of our business units according to the particular staffing, sourcing or consulting services for the particular clients, industrial and geographic end-markets that each such business unit serves. To narrow the Total Market, we identified competitors that provide similar services to our own within the niches in which we often operate. Clients or others familiar with the market were also consulted for this purpose. Using these additional sources, the Addressable Market relating to our particular business units were estimated. These estimates have their limitations and may not align with how other market participants view the size of our niche markets; and - “market position” represents our share of revenue of the Addressable Market of our business units, except where otherwise indicated. These market positions are higher than if we were to focus on the more general and broad markets in which we operate as measured by the Total Market.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading provider of HR solutions in key European staffing markets, offering end-to-end temporary recruiting and outsourcing services. We supply specialized and niche staffing to primarily small and medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) clients in a diversified range of end-markets. We offer and tailor our services to the staffing needs of our clients through our engineering and consulting segment and specialized talent solutions segment, which are comprised of a well-developed portfolio of ten specialized business units, which we call Powerhouses, across various countries. We also offer digital recruiting through our dedicated platforms, using our digital tools, including, NOWJOBS, SWOP and Gighouse app, targeting low-skilled, high-volume markets with significant roll-out potential. Since our founding, we have expanded from a presence in only Belgium to more than 10 countries in Europe. Corresponding to our geographic expansion, we have also become more diversified in the endmarkets we serve, primarily through our acquisitions in recent years, which provide us with staffing capabilities in additional areas such as pharmaceutical, healthcare, life sciences, government and public administration and technology. As of September 30, 2022, we had 72,296 job candidates at work and approximately 40,858 productive people at work (meaning the number of our job candidates adjusted to reflect a 38 hour per week workweek) and 4,734 in-house full-time equivalent employees. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we had 31,456 unique clients, our Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue was €2,770.0 million and our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA was €330.5 million. Our engineering and consulting segment represents 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. This segment supplies staffing of highly-skilled professionals, such as engineering consultants and financial and insurance specialists, to fill specialized roles in a variety of end-markets, such as financial, industrial, logistics, infrastructure, public administration and construction, and, more recently, fast-evolving and highly resilient sectors such as energy, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and technology. This segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu Professionals, Redmore, GRITT, Cohedron and SOLCOM Powerhouses and has the broadest geographic footprint, with its primary operations in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The engineering and consulting segment assists clients in the search and selection of the right candidate, including for interim management and secondments, and such temporary client assignments generally last for months. The below chart illustrates in blue the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for our engineering and consulting segment. ----- Our specialized talent solutions segment represents 46.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. This segment supplies specialized staffing of high-demand mid-skilled workers for specialized positions, such as clerical positions, carpenters, nurses and machine engineers, as well as blue-collar workers to companies in certain sectors, including construction, retail, finance, food, healthcare and construction. This segment is comprised of our Accent, Covebo, TIMEPARTNER and TMI Powerhouses, with their primary operations in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as branches in countries that form part of their international recruiting networks, which currently operate principally for this segment though we are planning to expand them for our engineering and consulting segment. These international branches provide us with the capability to source foreign candidates to bridge the large gap between the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates, especially as the labor market in our Addressable Markets has tightened over the past few years. The Specialized Talent Solution segment generally delivers job candidates through temporary agencies to clients in a fast and flexible way when they are shorthanded, with duration of job placements typically lasting for weeks, but they could also last hours or months depending on the needs of our clients. The below chart illustrates in pink the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for our Specialized Talent Solution segment. We serve as an intermediary between job candidates and their ultimate employer by matching up candidates that are looking to find a job, gain experience or find variety or flexibility with our clients that are looking for specialist skills, flexible employee arrangements, time and cost efficiencies or to cover peaks or sourcing for particular projects. We source and screen candidates, provide candidate matching services and present candidates to the client. We also assist with the hiring of the candidates by customers, client and candidate retention, provide timesheet, invoicing and payroll services, and regularly follow up with clients. We aim to help our clients at all stages of the recruiting process to relieve their management from the burden of having to seek appropriate job candidates for available positions. To ensure that we are able to tap into skilled workforces, we offer career coaching to job candidates in order to help them find career paths that align with their professional goals, and we provide in-house training to equip them to match the job profiles in which they are interested or that are scarce in the market to increase job candidates’ employability. We also offer support to foreign job candidates, including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance. We enter into employment contracts with the candidates and pay their salaries. We enter into placement contracts with our clients and bill our clients for our services. Our bill-pay spread is a key driver of our profitability and supports our industry-leading gross margins. We maximize bill-pay spread as a result of candidate scarcity, our niche focus, our SME and local customer focus, our premium service offering, our excellence in marketing candidates to jobs and non-solicitation or minimum fee/period protection for candidates in respect of clients. We have strong pricing power driven by contractual dynamics that ensure pass-through of salary increases. Our specialized talent solutions segment benefits from contractual dynamics which allow for an automatic pass-through to clients of price increases, and our business model also allows for limited bench risk because staffing contracts are back-to-back. In our engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with our clients, and we effectively manage to keep our bench time low by matching confirmed upcoming client assignments to candidates. The business model of these two segments has enabled us to establish a track record of margin stability even during challenging economic conditions such as the Covid-19 pandemic and in the inflationary environment in 2022. ----- For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we generated 27.6%, 39.8%, 26.0% and 5.5% of our Pro Forma_ Management Adjusted Revenue in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, respectively. We have branches in the countries where we source job candidates, including Poland, Romania, Spain, Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal. As of September 30, 2022, we had a network of 742 branches and 18 recruitment offices. To complement our physical network of branches and reach new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies, including our SWOP application, our SWOP Recruiter application and our NOWJOBS platform. We have increased our focus on developing digital support growth initiatives for our primary operations to enable us to reach additional job candidates or serve new end-markets in a fully digital manner. We support businesses by providing flexible staffing solutions that are used throughout all stages of the economic cycle, resulting in our resilience during economic downturns. While the economy is strong, the job market tightens meaning that our clients need help sourcing candidates. As markets soften, companies typically shift to a more temporary workforce and need staffing solutions and flexibility. When markets reach the bottom of the cycle, temporary staffing suffers but then is characterized by a quick recovery as temporary employment tends to recover faster than permanent employment. For example, during the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, our business recovered from the early losses in approximately three to six weeks. We also have a highly variable cost base and the ability to pass on wage inflation, which supports the stability of our gross margins. For example, our Like-for-Like Revenue growth (based on the December 31, 2021 perimeter) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 fluctuated significantly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and were 2%, (9)% and 19%, respectively, but we were able to maintain a gross margin of approximately 28% throughout this period. Flexible staffing solutions proved instrumental in the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in a full recovery of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the retail, food retail and hospitality sectors were severely impacted across all our key markets due to lockdowns and other restrictive measures, which led to a significant reduction in our staffing activities in these sectors. Certain sectors, such as logistics and education, however, proved to be less sensitive to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, and clients in these sectors continued to seek our services, particularly for high-skilled, specialized roles. In addition, demand for staffing services from municipalities and government agencies during the Covid-19 pandemic increased due to, among other developments, work related to the administration of government support measures, which we were able to capitalize on given our specialization in this end-market provided by the Cohedron Powerhouse in our engineering and consulting segment. We were founded in 1995 by Philip Cracco and Conny Vandendriessche along with a financial sponsor as a Belgium-based recruiting firm. Originally called Accent, we changed our name to House of HR in 2012. Over the course of 2012 to 2014, Naxicap, a French private equity firm, acquired a majority stake in our business, and we have expanded significantly to become a leading provider of specialized HR solutions in multiple European markets. On November 3, 2022, Bain Capital acquired a majority stake in the Group, with Naxicap, Conny Vandendriessche and management maintaining stakes. See “—The _Transactions.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Operating in highly resilient markets with favorable tailwinds and structural demand dynamics,"The HR solutions market has historically shown quick recovery in demand following periods of economic downturns. The general temporary staffing market, as a whole, has a long-term positive GDP growth trajectory and tends to recover quickly after an economic downturn. Within this market, specialized staffing companies, like us, also benefit from higher resiliency than generalist staffing companies that rely on the low value-add mass labor market. Specialized staffing companies benefit from lower cyclicality compared to generalist staffing companies due to specialty profiles. Specialized staffing companies also benefit from increased penetration with clients compared to generalist staffing ----- companies due to more clients in these specialized sectors turning to staffing solutions providers like us to assist them with candidate searches and provide them with higher value-add solutions. The below graph demonstrates the relative resilience of the specialist temporary staffing companies: Note: Specialists include Alten, Amadeus, Assystem, Page and Robert Half, and Generalists include Adecco, Manpower, Randstad. European Union and national regulations applicable in the key countries in which we operate tend to reinforce protection of permanent workers, which can lead companies to favor temporary work and outsourcing solutions as employers often prefer to hire on a more temporary basis before offering an employee a permanent contract. This trend is especially evident in recovery periods after a trough in the economic cycle as companies seek to scale up their workforce. For example, we were able to quickly recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with our sales fully recovering to pre-Covid 19 levels during 2021. At the same time, legislation in the countries in which we principally operate allows for multiple temporary staffing solutions, further supporting our business model. We believe that high job vacancy rates offer us strong protection from a potential downturn in the nearterm as there would still be significant numbers of unfilled positions even with a reduction in vacancies, which is similar to reductions that occurred during recent downturns. We offer our clients the ability to recruit job candidates with specific profiles for jobs that are particularly difficult to fill, including from abroad where needed, as we draw upon an international talent pool and provide required training. We operate in markets where fundamentals for businesses such as ours are improving over time, supported both by macroeconomic factors and positive structural demographic dynamics. Western Europe generally is experiencing a large, chronic and growing supply and demand gap for skilled employees, particularly related to technical engineering, specialized consulting and specialized blue-collar labor, obliging companies to look beyond traditional job candidate sourcing and seek the help of specialized staffing solutions providers like us. For example, unemployment rates in Germany were at 3.5% in 2021, as compared to 8.7% in 2007. In the Netherlands and Belgium, they were at 4.0% and 6.4%, respectively, in 2021 as compared to a recent peak of 7.4% and 8.5%, respectively, in 2014. Job vacancies in Belgium were at their highest in the second quarter of 2022 since 2012, and in Germany and the Netherlands were at their highest in the second and third quarters of 2022, respectively, since 2007. The staffing industry also benefits from a number of long-term underlying trends that have supported our industry’s historical and projected medium- to long-term growth. Demand for the types of solutions we provide is expected to continue growing in the future due to a number of positive secular trends, including: - Aging populations in our target markets and increasing competition for talent; - Technological changes to job candidates’ search for employment opportunities, including the switch to mobile technology, that are more challenging for employers to handle in-house; ----- - Workers increasingly prioritizing career mobility and focusing on smaller, entrepreneurial opportunities; - The need for workers to train or re-skill to adapt to changing work opportunities; - The desire of companies to address issues relating to diversity, inclusion and corporate social responsibility; - Workers placing an increased premium on quality of life and happiness at both a personal and professional level, and an increased preference for job flexibility, especially since the Covid19 pandemic, leading to increased job rotation; - Financial pressures resulting in increased outsourcing and offshoring; and - Increasing use of artificial intelligence, data mining and robotization, as well as technological change, all of which contribute to the skill supply-demand gap in labor markets. - Especially for freelance workers, the prospect of better economics in spite of lower job security. As a result of these secular trends, both employers and workers increasingly turn towards flexible staffing models, driving demand for extended workforce solutions. According to an external consultant analysis, in Belgium, Netherlands and France, the number of workers that are part of the extended workforce (i.e., contractors and other freelancers) has grown from 2016 to 2021 at a CAGR of 3.9%, 2.5% and 4.4%, respectively. These growth rates are above those registered in the total working population, which over the same period has grown at a CAGR of 1.0% in Belgium, 1.3% in the Netherlands and 0.4% in France. This is also evidenced by the growth in penetration of the extended workforce as part of the total workforce, with penetration rates in 2021 ranging from 7.2% in France to 10.2% in the Netherlands. We believe we are well positioned to capture penetration in specialized extended labor. These underlying trends contribute to the complexity of job searches and encourage companies to turn to staffing solutions providers like us to help them fulfill their staffing needs. In addition, they make it more challenging for new market entrants to effectively compete with established providers like us. We have strategically positioned ourselves in geographic markets that are supported by macroeconomic factors and positive demand dynamics in order to take full advantage of favorable trends. We believe that the fundamentals of our Addressable Market remain strong in the medium-term and we believe that we are poised to continue growing at or above the industry average growth rate in the future due to our business model.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,"Increasingly diversified exposure to resilient and profitable end-markets targeting highly loyal and less price-sensitive SME clients, with a focus on scarcity-driven specialist candidates","Our client focus is centered on SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises that require high-touch local service and operate in specialty niches that are in high demand. This focus supports our above market growth and margins and provides us resilience as a result of the critical nature of the positions sought by our clients. We believe that SMEs represent a particularly attractive client base as they are generally more loyal customers and are less price sensitive. SMEs tend to be more reliant on each employee and have lower workforce anticipation capabilities than large corporates, so the absence of a single worker can be critical. As a result, when they need to hire someone, they need someone fairly quickly and place a premium on the ability to source job candidates within their time constraints. As SMEs may have more limited or no in-house recruiting capabilities, they are more willing to outsource many of their staffing-related needs to providers like us who can provide a full service offering at all stages of the recruitment lifecycle. SMEs often have limited employer branding and therefore may experience difficulty in reaching the best job candidates without access to the talent pool of a staffing solutions provider. SMEs also often have a faster decision-making process compared to large corporates and lack purchasing departments, so we may face less pricing pressure from such companies. In addition, SMEs, ----- due to the smaller size of their employee pools, are less likely to lay off workers in a downturn and typically maintain a more consistent level of employment than larger companies during a downturn. The stability of employee levels at SMEs was evident during the global financial crisis as, based on information from Accent, employment volumes were resilient at small companies and demonstrated growth from 2008 to 2016. We have a track record of serving the attractive SME segment, with a focus on scarcity-driven specialist candidates. We believe that the ability to find a specific candidate with the right cultural fit is important for SMEs, since they typically have small teams and often seek a particular candidate who is not only qualified for the job, but also matches the client’s corporate culture. Our ability to match such job candidates results from our blend of human and digital touchpoints, with regular interaction with clients and job candidates throughout the recruitment lifecycle (including our international recruiting capabilities). HR staffing solutions also operate in a complex regulatory environment, and we provide our clients with the required specific knowledge by sector, geography and even region. We believe the ability to manage this complexity on a large scale increases the barriers to entry for the sector and diminishes the risk for digital disruption or disintermediation. In addition to our focus on SMEs, we focus on specialist candidates, which provides further resilience to our business as skilled jobs are less cyclical. For example, in France, the unemployment rate for unskilled jobs has had an approximately 8% variation between 2000 and 2020 as compared to a rate of approximately 2% for skilled workers as demonstrated by the chart below. Source: Company information, External consultant analysis, INSEE Note: Based on France. Skilled works are defined as those with two years of post-high school diploma education (baccalaureate) and unskilled workers are defined as those who hold no diploma In particular, we focus on specialty niches that are in high demand and that support higher revenue growth and margins than generalist staffing. We market our services under brands that relate to specific specialized services offered by our Powerhouses or sub business-unit or brands under a Powerhouse, which we call Boutiques. Our multiple brand approach has proven effective in attracting and retaining clients and candidates. For example, our Facebook page of Accent currently has, in most instances, ----- almost twice the number of followers (61.0K) than the Facebook pages of our competitors Randstad Belgium (27.0K), RGF Staffing (Start People) (35.0K) or Adecco Belgium (39.0K) as of November 2022. We also benefit from having diversified our business activities towards more resilient end-markets and job candidate profiles. Our new business structure is reflective of our strategy, which is geared towards moving away from general staffing to a more specialized staffing focus. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our business mix included more of a focus on general staffing, with 15% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA coming from our general staffing segment, 46% from our engineering and consulting segment and 39% from our specialized staffing segment (based on our consolidation perimeter for 2018) whereas for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) was attributable to our engineering and consulting segment and 46.5% was attributable to our specialized talent solution segment (which includes general staffing). We also have actively increased our endmarket mix to focus on public sector, IT and telecommunications, healthcare, food and financial and legal end-markets, which are more resilient throughout the economic cycle. The below chart shows our revenue for the year ended December 2018 by end-market compared to our Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue by end-market for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our focus on niche and specialty staffing highlights the added value we can provide to companies looking for specific job candidate profiles which are often difficult to find, and in our experience, clients are willing to attach a premium to such services. Our focus on niche and specialty staffing also enables us to recruit and retain qualified job candidates. Even when we serve large corporate clients, we believe our provision of specialized staffing solutions enables us to maintain pricing power as a result of the quality of and demand for our job candidates. ----- We believe that our geographic footprint, branch density and our ability to recruit internationally are challenging to replicate and are essential to fostering the client relationships and granular geographic reach necessary to reach our targeted SME and specialty-focused clients. We maintain and have access to a large database of job candidates to enable short matching times and have acquired in-depth endmarket experience through selective organic and external growth over many years, which facilitates our ability to source, match and retain job candidates and clients in our key markets.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.3,Outstanding performance throughout the cycle demonstrating highly resilient profile,"We have grown our business over recent years both organically and through targeted, strategic and value-accretive acquisitions. From 2008 to 2021, our Like-for-Like Revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 7.8%. We believe that our largely consistent positive Like-for-Like Revenue growth in each business segment and for the pro forma perimeter outperforms the market and evidences the success of our differentiated business model. In addition, we achieved Organic Growth of 19.9% in the year ended December 31, 2021, and 17.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our Likefor-Like Revenue growth across the various stages of the economic cycle from 2008 demonstrates the resilience of our revenues and our ability to recover from economic downturns at a more rapid rate than GDP. We have been able to maintain strong EBITDA margins even through challenging macroeconomic conditions. The chart below portrays our Like-for-Like Revenue growth from 2008 to the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 showing our organic and external growth and our EBITDA margins, including the unaudited business unit accounts of Accent, as well as those of our other business units, on the basis as described in the notes below. Source: Company information, OECD Notes: In preparing the above chart, we have included historical revenue information based on business unit accounts from various periods, past due diligence reports and management analysis. The total amounts include corporate costs. Although we believe the underlying materials used and the basis of preparation to be reasonable, actual results may vary from the indicative information presented above, in particular due to different accounting bases of preparation, and such variations could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on the inclusion of such information. Furthermore, the growth presented in the chart is prepared on a different basis than our Organic Growth presented elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

We also have a strong track record of external growth through highly accretive acquisitions in a fragmented market. We approach our growth through acquisitions with rigorous discipline. We focus on acquiring successful, profitable companies rather than turn-around acquisitions. Our evaluation of a potential acquisition target includes reviewing the opportunity through the rubric of a number of stringent requirements designed to ensure fit with our overall strategy and culture. The target must fit an identified strategic need to expand our geographic coverage, complement a specific specialty or fill a niche skill gap. We also seek out targets with like-minded management teams with an entrepreneurial spirit and long-term commitment in order to ensure a strong overall cultural fit. We also evaluate the target’s profitability, historic growth and other performance metrics, and assess whether it is a leader in its addressable markets. Once we have identified and then acquired a target, we have a well-defined and proven integration process that involves consolidating the target into our Group reporting system and sharing best practices. Local management teams are given the opportunity to invest at group level or to continue to invest at the local level. We have completed 42 transactions since 2018, comprised of bolton acquisitions with lower multiples that enable growth at the local level, as well as platform acquisitions through which we expand our solutions and enter new specialties or markets. We have an excellent integration track record with our targets’ EBITDA and revenue growing by approximately 8% per annum and 10% on average after we integrated them, as demonstrated by our acquisitions of Abylsen, Covebo, Continu, TIMEPARTNER and Redmore.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,Reference player in target markets with proven track record of above-market performance delivering higher margins driven by highly incentivized management team,"----- We occupy leading positions across the highly fragmented markets in which we operate. Many of our operating companies are reference players within their respective specialty, benefiting from the virtuous cycle of competitive leadership, with their track record, enabling them to capture a high percentage of their market growth and benefiting from brand loyalty and pricing power as a result. The table below shows our relative market positioning vis-à-vis our peers: Source: External consultant analysis; peer companies’ filings; Company information (1) Based on a numerical mean of revenue growth percentage of each entity. For peers based on last four to five years average, apart from local players (based on 2019 excluding Assystem), and with respect to House of HR, based on over the cycle performance. (2) For each peer, based on a numerical mean of latest publicly available EBITDA margin (post IFRS-16) as a percentage and with respect to House of HR, based on the results of operation for 2021. Based on Net Promoter Scores, we are the most recommended HR solutions provider by customers in the Netherlands and second most recommended HR solutions provider by SME customers in Belgium. In addition, based on Google reviews, we are the most recommended HR solutions provider by job candidate in Belgium and second most recommended HR solutions provider by job candidates in the Netherlands. Our clients make staffing decisions at a local level and our large footprint with high branch density allows us to be physically present in the communities where our clients operate, meaning that clients have a familiarity with our brand at a local level, which provides a key competitive advantage for us. We believe we are unique among our peers and that this is reflected in our performance compared to certain of our competitors. Our Like-for-Like Revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8% from 2008 to 2021 (based on our 2020 consolidation perimeter excluding avanti, Cohedron, SOLCOM and TMI and including Solyne and Greenworking) as compared to the Organic Growth average (weighted by business mix) of our peer benchmark, including Adecco, Randstad and Alten, which grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% during the same period. In addition, we have a track record of significant growth above market, with nominal GDP growing at annual compound growth rate of approximately 1% from 2008 to 2021 (based on the nominal GDP growth for the Eurozone) and the volume of the number of temporary workers (based on a weighted average of publicly available information in Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands) having a negative annual compound growth rate during the same period. We also enjoyed best-in-class profitability compared to our specialist and generalist peers. This is demonstrated by the below chart comparing our EBITDA margins on a total basis, for our engineering and consulting segment and for ----- our specialized staffing solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the EBITDA margins of some of our specialist and generalist peers for the same period. Source: Peer companies’ filings; Company information. Note: December 31, 2021 figures for House of HR based on December 31, 2020 perimeter. Figures for Amadeus Fire are based on the Personnel Services division excluding the Training division. 1 Average is calculated as the numerical mean of percentage of EBITDA margin. We believe our above-market performance is driven by our strong entrepreneurial culture and local incentivization model. We operate on a strong incentivization model with fast promotion opportunities, including opportunities to open new branches where a manager generates new business. Our variable bonus systems are intended to encourage growth and bonuses as we do not have bonus caps. Variable pay can represent up to 50% of the salary package for our employees, including the management of our business units, branch managers, sales consultants and recruitment consultants. The below chart illustrates the potential pay for one of our account managers on a base salary of €33,000 as compared to an account manager on a base salary of €35,000 at one of our competitors, which demonstrates the additional opportunities provided by us. Source: Company information, External consultant analysis We believe our model encourages winning behaviors from our employees, driven by an owner mindset. We have highly invested top-level and mid-level managers, with 412 managers having reinvested approximately 63% of the net proceeds received from the Acquisition in the new structure, which confirms their belief in House of HR and our business model. Including new joiners, currently approximately 500 members of management are invested in the company. Such investment encourages employees to focus on building relationships, both with clients and candidates, which helps to support our performance. We also typically offer an appealing value proposition to managers of the businesses we acquire by allowing these individuals to retain autonomy over their respective entities’ operations, including brand and identity, while allowing them to benefit from central support on complex regulatory and compliance topics, access to our foreign sourcing network and digital platforms and access to our financing. We also offer such managers an incentive structure tied to, where possible, both their own company’s and our overall results. We believe that this streamlines the integration process and helps to align the management of our acquisition targets with our central management. Together with the support of our new sponsor, Bain Capital, we replaced our long-term incentive plan, which was settled on or about the Acquisition Closing Date, with a new one on the Acquisition Closing Date in order to maintain our culture of incentivization and increase employee commitment and engagement. We also believe ----- that our long-term incentive plan allows for succession planning for key roles by incentivizing key staff to remain with the business and by enabling potential reinvestments in the equity of House of HR going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.5,"Ability to pass through wage increases to customers, including through automatic contractual mechanisms, and stable margins","We have the ability to pass through wage increases from inflation to customers in both our engineering and consulting segment and our specialized talent solutions segment, which, coupled with our flexible cost structure, has resulted in resilient gross margins. While our gross margins in both of our segments fluctuate somewhat as a result of seasonality around holiday periods, they have remained largely stable since January 2019 at approximately 22% to 28% (depending on Powerhouses and specialties) for our specialized talent solutions segment and approximately 30% to 37% for our engineering and consulting segment. Our revenues typically correlate with nominal GDP rather than real GDP due to our ability to pass through wage increases in an inflationary environment and stable margins. In our specialized talent solutions segment, price increases are automatically passed through to our clients. For this segment, our contract model is centered on matching the length of our candidate’s employment contract with us to the length of our placement contract with our client, the ultimate employer, in order to prevent lag time between inflation of gross salary paid to the candidate and the cost we charge to our clients, which results in an automatic pass-through of any salary increases. As contracts expire, we renegotiate them, which has historically resulted in an ability to increase our prices in line with wage inflation. We base our contract pricing on a candidate’s gross salary multiplied by a coefficient factor, with the split typically being transparent to the client. Our coefficient factors tend to remain relatively stable with slight fluctuations as a result of seasonality around holiday periods. For example, Accent’s coefficient factor has remained relatively stable since 2020 at an average of 2.2. The key pricing drivers for the coefficient factor are the scarcity of candidates and the value of any additional services we offer. Key costs for us include salaries and work accident insurance. At the end of the contract period, typically one week or one month in length, if salary increases, then we charge the cost of the higher salary to the client. During the first half of 2022, we achieved average price increases of approximately 5.0% (calculated as the numerical mean of the average price increases across certain Powerhouses, weighted equally). Growth in euro-per-hour billed in our specialized talent solutions segment is driven by increasing cost per hour paid and billed, as well as through increasing bench costs. Our gross margin per hour billed remained highly stable at approximately 23% to 25% (including bench costs) and approximately 29% to 30% (excluding bench costs) for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as shown in the below chart. Source: Company information, External consultant analysis Note: GM0 = Gross Margin on billed hours only (excl. bench costs); GM = Gross Margin (incl. bench costs / unbilled hours). Difference between GM0 and GM is bench cost. Bench costs include paid sickness and paid holiday. ----- 1 Excluding Atrium and BE-Consult given ongoing integration. In our engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with clients. The contracts are typically time and material contracts with no obligations for any specific result. Most of our candidates in our engineering and consulting segment are permanently hired by us using employment contracts that typically have three- to six-week notice periods. We have placement contracts with our clients that typically last nine to twelve months, which allows us to effectively manage bench time and match our candidates with the upcoming mandates from clients. In most cases, we plan for salary increases in advance and negotiate rate increases with our clients accordingly. Our pricing model in our engineering and consulting segment centers on charging the client an hourly or daily rate. Our billing rate is typically based on an hourly wage and a mark-up where the split is usually not transparent to clients. Since 2021, we have been able to consistently increase our hourly rate in this segment. For example, at Talent&Pro, one of our Redmore Boutiques that focuses on the finance industry staffing, although our hourly rate fluctuated between €46.8 and €48.1 per hour during the course of 2020, by the end of December 2021 we were able to increase it to approximately €49.6, and have continued to increase it during the course of 2022, with an hourly rate of €53.5 as of September 2022. Key drivers of the hourly or daily rates are skills, seniority and scarcity of candidates. Our key costs include salary, potentially including a company car. At the end of a placement contract, renewal either entails replacing the candidate with a new or more junior person at a new price or placing the same candidate, who is now more senior, at a higher price. During the first half of 2022, we achieved average price increases of approximately 6.6% (calculated as the numerical mean of the average price increases across certain Powerhouses, weighted equally). Margin growth in our engineering and consulting segment is driven by increasing the cost per hour paid and billed. Bench-time risk is effectively managed by matching confirmed upcoming client assignments to candidates. Our gross margin per hour billed in this segment also remained stable at approximately 32% to 34% (including bench costs) and approximately 45% to 47% (excluding bench costs) for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Source: Company information, External consultant analysis Note: GM0 = Gross Margin on billed hours only (excl. bench costs); GM = Gross Margin (incl. bench costs / unbilled hours).

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.6,Robust financial profile supports cash generation with a highly variable cost base and proven ability to deleverage,"Our business model has supported strong EBITDA growth and profitability. We demonstrated our financial resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic with strong EBITDA margins of 11%, 10% and 12% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and 11% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. We have limited capital expenditure requirements (primarily related ----- to IT investments and expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, primarily related to our headquarters, furniture and infrastructure for our branch network, accommodation for foreign job candidates, company cars) of approximately 1% of revenue in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. As our key assets are the talent we provide to meet the temporary staffing needs of our clients, we have limited fixed assets or cash tied up in inventory. Working capital largely consists of receivables (client billings) and payables (job candidate wages, social security, etc.) tied to individual job candidate placements. The receivable for each job candidate placement is typically higher than the payable with the difference roughly representing the bill-pay spread or gross margin embedded in the client service agreement and job candidate agreement. Working capital as a percentage of sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, was 4.9% of sales, compared to 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The working capital dynamics and corresponding downside protection for our cash flows are also evident in our recent performance. As volumes of job candidates reduce, for instance, during period of economic downturns, we benefit from significant working capital inflows, which gives us strong cash resiliency. In 2020, we experienced a positive change in working capital demonstrating the counter-cyclical nature of our working capital profile. As a result, we experience high cash conversion and cash flow growth, which has, in turn, supported our business growth, and has in the past, allowed us to deleverage on a net debt basis following each of our refinancings. The following chart shows our Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow and our Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow as a percentage of EBITDA cash for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. We also benefit from a flexible cost structure, with approximately 95% of our costs being variable or semi-variable allowing for highly stable gross margins through the cycle. For 2021, approximately 65.1% of our total operating expenses were variable, 31.7% were semi-variable and 3.2% were fixed costs. Our cost of services, which represented 79.1% of our total operational expenses (cost of services and operating expenses together) for the year ended December 31, 2021, is comprised of mostly variable costs related to our people at work (mainly payroll, social security contributions, housing, car fleet and subcontracting costs). Our direct costs linked to our branches are primarily semi-variable and include staff costs, including costs of managers and recruiters, and branch expenses, such as rents, car leases and training, marketing and communication costs. Our overheads related to corporate functions at both an operating company and Group-level, which represented less than 5% of our total operating expenses, consists primarily of fixed costs. Further, due to our back-to-back contract model, we experience limited bench risk in respect of people at work. In many of our jurisdictions, we are able to match the duration of the employment of our job candidates and their placement, allowing us to be flexible in the deployment of our job candidate resources. As costs generally track revenue, costs of service as a percentage of revenue, and as a result, our margins, generally remain stable during downturns, as demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.7,We are well-protected from disruption by other digital players and have developed an emerging platform for excellent proprietary digital offering,"We have an excellent proprietary digital offering and based on interviews with market participants we believe we are well-protected from disruption from typical digital players that focus on a low-skilled, higher volume business. We believe we are differentiated from such market participants because our core offering is focused on specialty staffing and focused on SMEs that require customized services, which are much more difficult to standardize or automate. We believe that we are a thought leader and ahead of our larger peers in many respects as a result of our development of digital initiatives in order to both address new markets with innovative business models and improve our own and existing operations. To complement our physical network of branches and reach new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies that are revenuegenerating. Our NOWJOBS platform, which successfully competes in the low-skill, higher volume segment, is primarily geared to students and other seekers of one-off temporary jobs, and is to date our most successful digital initiative. Originally just available in Belgium where it launched in 2017, we launched NOWJOBS in the Netherlands in 2019, in France in 2021 and in Germany in June 2022, bringing on board big customers such as retail brands H&M and Picnic. For the year ended December 31, 2021, NOWJOBS handled approximately 1.1 billion requests and generated €54.1 million, €1.9 million and €0.2 million in revenues in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, respectively. Following our acquisition of StaffMe in July 2022, NOWJOBS will operate under the StaffMe brand in France given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country. In addition, we launched our SWOP Recruiter application in May 2021, which is a free digital platform that helps Belgian SMEs with the day-to-day management of their vacancies. The application is linked to our SWOP application, which we launched in 2016 and further upgraded in 2020, and is now one of the largest Belgian apps to help job seekers find a new permanent job. We launched SWOP in the Netherlands in October 2022 and plan to launch SWOP in Germany in the near future. Our Gighouse app is a digital platform that matches freelancers and independent job candidates with available projects at our customers. We aim to leverage our experience as a disruptor in the market to expand successful initiatives to our broader Group. In addition, we have also developed a number of complementary digital offerings that supplement our core services. For example, in June 2019, we launched our MyAccent app, which allows potential job candidates to interact via the Google Home assistant with Accent’s list of open positions. Book’u is our planning tool, allowing customers to plan both their permanent and temporary workforce in one solution, being in touch with this workforce to communicate when they should be available and allowing to spot potential staffing shortages, immediately posting these shortages at their staffing companies of choice. My Talents (Softskillz) testing has been developed together with the University of Ghent, to test ‘who you are’ as a person and to test ‘what type of company do I want to work for.’ These tests will allow for better AI matching of jobs with candidates. Continu-Connect, which launched in 2021 and had 756 registered contacts as of December 31, 2021, shows all available candidates in a region for our customers. Our FYGI app brings together freelance HR recruiters with companies that have a recruitment request. We have also other apps and platforms that assist with the recruitment and other staffing processes, such as Dora, Ariad and CV Creator. All apps are developed taking into account reusability across all House of HR operating companies, benefitting therefore from the economies of scale House of HR has versus local competitors and increasing the barriers to entry for our industry. During 2021, we centralized all our digital assets in House of Invest, creating one platform to meet current needs and invest in new needs as they arise. This enabled us to further invest in our digital roadmap and internationalize our digital initiatives, bringing our digital and IT talents together to work on multiple digital solutions. The main purpose of House of Invest is to roll out the digital initiatives across all House of HR Powerhouses and Boutiques and to capitalize on a centralized knowledge base. House of Invest now owns NOWJOBS, Gighouse, SWOP and SWOP Recruiter, Continu-Connect, CV creator and My Talents (Softskillz), and holds minority ownerships in Dora and Ariad (a traditional digital marketing staffing company) and a majority ownership in Book’u. ----- For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from digital solutions amounted to 2.6% of total revenue, compared to 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have continued investing in IT in 2022 and expect to continue prioritizing the digital venue going forward. We believe our digital offering protects us from disruptions from digital players who focus on low-skilled, high volume business, while our platforms continue to focus on high-skilled job candidates with a focus on SMEs. We are also continuing to innovate our existing processes by identifying areas within our business that could benefit from increased automation and zero-paper processes, including both job candidate- and client-facing and internal processes, such as finance, procurement and marketing and communications. Further, we continue to digitalize our processes and create a centralized repository designed to store, process and secure large amounts of data across our different applications, which will enhance our access to job candidates and improve our matching capabilities. We believe the efficiencies we can realize through this digitalization will produce cost savings while allowing us to meet the everincreasing demands of clients and job candidates.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.8,"Entrepreneurial and invested management team with long-term incentive culture backed by a new, highly supportive shareholder with deep industry knowledge","We benefit from a strong and committed management team that is highly motivated to deliver strong performance over the long term. We believe our successful organic and external growth has been due in part to the way in which we have been able to incentivize our managers. For example, our organic “cell division” expansion strategy rewards our local managers with the opportunity to create and run individual branches, fostering loyalty and encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit that has delivered our success to date. For our engineering and consulting branches, our variable pay structure rewards management down to the sales and recruitment consultants with variable pay linked to key performance indicators such as attracting, matching and retaining job candidates and clients. While keeping a highly entrepreneurial culture at the Powerhouse and Boutique levels, all strategic decisions with a significant impact are made at House of HR level, and our local business units share in the centralized corporate support and institutional knowledge.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.1,"Make use of our agile, decentralized operating model to further focus on organic growth by grasping additional market share while maintaining best-in-class profitability","Over the years, we have been highly successful in achieving incremental organic revenue growth under our “cell division” approach in our specialized talents solutions segment as clients are mostly SMEs who require high touch local services. In most of our markets, we expect to continue our strategy of embedding ourselves in local communities through an extensive branch network. While our primary operations are in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, we have branches spread across countries where we source job candidates. Our international recruiting network is key for our ability to attract and retain job candidates for assignments in sectors where candidates are scarce. Our decentralized structure places our Powerhouses and Boutiques in proximity to our primary stakeholders: ----- our clients, our job candidates and our own employees, which allows us to gain local market knowledge, understand local competition and remain informed of local staffing trends. In order to continue to grow, we intend to expand our branch network where needed and to continue to leverage our success in sourcing and retaining job candidates, focusing on those job profiles which are and will be increasingly scarce in the market. We also believe our extensive branch network approach leads to enhanced entrepreneurship and ownership due to the managerial responsibilities and opportunities allocated or available to branch managers, reinforcing a key part of our values. We also intend to continue to focus on, and leverage our positive track record in, our engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions segments to continue growing profitably. We have gradually shifted our focus toward the engineering and consulting and specialized staffing model and away from general staffing, benefiting from our growing network in the transition to deliver higher margins. The specialized staffing and engineering and consulting segments tend to deliver higher margins than general staffing due to the premium clients place on successful placement of the specific job candidates that they seek. Specialization in turn aims to target those segments and skills that are more difficult to find for our customers, which in the past has provided more stability to our revenue figures and protected our margins, including during economic downturns. We further aim to deliver continued improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin through efficient cost control over operating expense and strong cash conversion with rigorous management of capital expenditures and working capital. We believe our agile organization and increased specialization will continue to promote flexibility for our Powerhouses and Boutiques to refine recruitment approaches and conduct day-to-day activities that best meet their respective local business needs and enable us to offer clients tailored staffing services. We believe this will continue to translate into higher market penetration and additional market share to propel our organic growth, as well as our ability to effectively staff specialized jobs that drive our bestin-class profitability given the scarcity and complexity of the job profiles we match.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.2,Enhance our reputation as the partner of choice for SMEs and locally managed clients,"We intend to continue providing critical end-to-end temporary recruiting and outsourcing services that are tailored to the needs of SMEs and other locally-managed clients. We believe that in the future these clients, in both our engineering and consulting segment and specialized talent solutions segment, will continue to require the assistance of providers like us primarily for temporary HR solutions as they grapple with limited resources, lower visibility on staffing needs and greater need for outsourced HR functions, including as a result of the complexity of labor law and associated regulations. As the partner of choice for our SMEs and locally managed clients, we are experienced in accommodating unique and time-sensitive client demands, including matching specialized, “mission-critical” profiles for our clients in the engineering and consulting segment that typically last for months, or deploying a large number of blue-collar workers at short notice for our clients in the specialized talent solutions segment that often last for weeks or sometimes just hours as the situations require. We plan to continue focusing on being the partner of choice for SMEs and locally managed clients by leveraging the large pool of potential job candidates at our disposal and the deep end-market knowledge we have gathered over the years by having boots on the ground in proximity to our clients.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.3,Ensure the smooth and profitable placement of job candidates with a reliable sourcing and reskilling platform,"Mastering the “human” aspect of human resources is key to success in our industry, and we intend to continue to be a leader through our focus on being able to source the right job candidate for the right position, including through offering reskilling services. We believe that our network of international sourcing of job candidates is vital to our success, as we are better able to bridge the large gap between the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates, especially as the labor market in our Addressable Market has tightened over the past few years, through having access to a wider pool of quality job candidates than our peers. The location of our agencies (particularly in Poland, Romania, Spain, the Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal) and the support we offer to foreign job candidates ----- (including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance) ensures that we are able to tap into workforces that are skilled but that are eager to seek out opportunities to earn higher wages than those that similar work would provide in their home countries. We intend to continue to develop our network in other countries that meet these criteria. We also plan to continue leveraging our large sourcing network to target the best job candidates and provide them with a wide array of positions and support, including in-house training that equips them with skillsets that match the profiles that our clients look for, administrative support, client knowledge and even transport and housing for foreign job candidates to make their experience as smooth as possible. Finally, we plan to focus on preparing job candidates for what we see as the jobs of tomorrow, such as white-collar positions in big data and information technology, that are being driven by the digitalization of the economy or provide training in order to teach blue-collar job candidates how to use digital tools.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.4,Utilize digital initiatives to reduce cost and drive revenue diversification,"Our digital strategy is focused on maximizing the impact of digital cost reduction initiatives, outpacing smaller competitors who have more limited investment capabilities and opening new market segments. In the near-term, we want to leverage digital tools to complement our physical networks to attract job candidates and clients while also spreading awareness of our brands and services. We also intend to continue digitalizing our processes to drive efficiency. For example, SWOP, our free digital sourcing platform that assists SMEs with day-to-day management of their vacancies, strengthens our sourcing capability and supplements the activities of our revenue-generating business units, such as NOWJOBS, which facilitates the actual matching of job candidates with clients. Over the longer term, we intend to pursue a four-pillared digital strategy. First, we aim to reposition the offices we have in urban areas into “JobShops” that are easy to reach, convenient, one-stop shops where job candidates can be tested, get certifications and be matched with potential positions through our digital platforms that require limited involvement of our recruiting consultants. We also are continuing to develop niche, specialized digital platforms that are tailored to meet the specific demands of the various markets we address. Furthermore, we intend to utilize the data that we have generated through our large network to deliver the best possible client and job candidate service through our candidate data platform. For example, we are currently developing Mission Akira, a data-driven tool that helps to train our consultants on the kind of information that they should ask candidates for in order to better prepare them for placement. We are also developing a client version of the ‘Who do I want to work for’ test, which indicates the type of job candidates that fit best with a particular team leader, and the ‘My brains’ test which attempts to indicate the intelligence level of a job candidate within their education level. We also plan to develop more automated processes to free up our recruiting consultants’ time for them to focus on growing ever closer to our client and job candidate base and gather the right information that will lead to faster and better matching. As part of our digital strategy, we are in the process of rolling out our digital platforms internationally to enable us to get more structured and accurate information from job candidates, so we can match them with the right clients in a more effective and flexible manner, which we believe will help introduce brand loyalty and help us with client and job candidates retention. For example, NOWJOBS was first launched in Belgium in 2017, and it was subsequently launched in the Netherlands in 2019, in France in 2021 and most recently in Germany in 2022. We also acquired StaffMe in July 2022, a French digital platform focusing on student employment and which is primarily active in the retail, health event and hospitality sectors, supplementing our NOWJOBS offering. Through this acquisition, we also acquired the other companies of the StaffMe group, including the StaffMe Academy, the first training organization for young entrepreneurs, and the Accelerator, a program of integration through selfemployment for those who are far from employment. NOWJOBS will operate under the StaffMe brand in France given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country. We plan to continue to develop our other digital platforms and roll them out beyond their current markets.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.5,Continue to target accretive acquisition opportunities to achieve European leadership,"----- While our primary focus is to grow our earnings base organically and to improve both profitability and Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow generation through our existing network and customer base, we will continue to consider accretive and strategic platform and bolt-on acquisitions in both new and existing markets to achieve our goal of European leadership. We do not consider acquisition opportunities aimed at turning around a business, but only will consider opportunities that can reinforce our market positions or expand our footprint, either in new geographical regions or niche areas in which we currently are not present and that exhibit the following attributes: stable economies with low unemployment, high salary level, high temporary staff penetration, a stable regulatory environment and supply and demand mismatch for skilled labor. We will continue to focus on acquisitions of highly specialized businesses (such as IT, legal and finance), business focusing on bottleneck jobs and engineering and consulting services. We will also consider opportunities in digital tools that can improve the value chain or allow us to better serve job candidates as well as clients and to develop new and complementary segments that are also marked by labor market scarcity or that can demonstrate the prospect for high growth and superior margins. We will continue to use our M&A assessment criteria, which requires that any opportunity meets our own high quality standards, holds a leading position in its respective specialized end-market, reflects a strong financial profile and represents a good cultural fit with us. While we historically have focused on bolt-on acquisitions that can enhance our network and/or provide us with exposure to complementary sectors of the economy, we also occasionally consider larger acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our investment criteria. We are also targeting, in particular, certain new end-markets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals and new geographic markets such as the Nordic countries and other countries, such as Austria and Switzerland.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions.,"Demand for our staffing services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity and economic conditions in the countries, regions and sectors in which we operate. A global economic downturn, such as the one resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, which impacts a country or region in which we operate may adversely affect our staffing services in that country or region, as fewer clients may seek our job candidates for assignments. In addition, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, global supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical conflicts have caused an immediate impact on global economic conditions, which has led to increased inflationary pressure in 2022, including causing increases in the price for goods and services, which has resulted and may continue to result in shortages in materials and services. Such shortages have resulted and may continue to result in inflationary cost increases for labor, fuel, materials and services, and could continue to cause costs to increase. Although we do not have direct economic activities in Russia and Ukraine and currently the conflict has not had any material impact on our overall sales and EBITDA, it is difficult to predict the scope and extent of any potential impact of the increasing tensions and other geopolitical conflicts could have on our operations, especially given we source candidates from Eastern Europe. Moreover, gas and other raw materials in relation to supply shortages are significantly impacting many industries and sectors, which could result in our clients reconsidering their recruitment efforts of domestic and foreign talents, which may, in turn, impact our results of operations. Furthermore, continuing increases in inflation could impact the overall demand for and costs of our services and the margins we are able to realize on our services, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Inflation may also result in higher interest rates, which in turn would result in higher interests we incur on our borrowings. While the global economy has recovered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, there remains considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the above factors and the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies which had been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies in the past decade. We cannot predict the long-term effects such factors may have on the global political and economic conditions, including whether they may result in a severe or prolonged global economic recession. Moreover, our revenue and results of operations are dependent on a limited number of countries in Europe and we have material operations in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France. For the year ended December 31, 2021, these countries accounted for 27.8%, 41.9%, 22.2% and 8.1%, respectively, of our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue and as a result, we are particularly exposed to risks arising from economic conditions in these countries. For example, as the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) represents a key export market for several of the countries in which we operate, ----- particularly Belgium and the Netherlands, adverse trade terms between the U.K. and the countries in which we operate following the entry into force of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on May 1, 2021 could have an adverse effect on the economies of these countries, which could by extension adversely affect demand for our services or our business. Moreover, there is a possibility that other Member States, including the countries where we source our job candidates, could also withdraw from the EU. If this materializes, it could pose further uncertainties on the application of laws and the economies within the EU and the countries involved, including limitation on the free movement of people, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, a downturn in the endmarkets in which we target clients could have a negative impact on the demand for our services or the prices clients are willing to pay for our services. Moreover, an economic downturn may impact us differently than it has in the past. Among our two business segments, specialized talent solutions has historically been more sensitive to economic fluctuations due to the temporary and flexible staffing element in this segment, which has led to decreases in demand for such services in connection with economic downturns, including that experienced in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic, even if it has historically recovered faster compared to the engineering and consulting segment. Actions that we take to decrease our expenses during an economic downturn may not prevent a loss in operating profit and could have a longer term impact on our operations. When demand drops or remains low, we attempt to reduce the amount of our sales and marketing expenses and job candidates in order to reduce our cost of services and operating expenses but such reductions may not occur as quickly as, or be sufficient to offset the decrease in our revenue. If periods of decline are prolonged and result in a significant decrease in the size of our in-house employees or job candidates, we may not be able to reduce our expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our business units, branches and brands. Furthermore, our decentralized structure can lead to increased costs, which in times of economic downturn could lead to decreased profitability. Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"The Covid-19 pandemic, including the resulting global economic uncertainty and the related lockdown measures, in particular its effects in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France where we have material operations, or other epidemics or pandemics, have had in the past, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand for our staffing services, our revenue, operations and workforce.","The Covid-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variants such as Delta and Omicron and related sub-variants, and the rapidly evolving reactions of authorities, including those in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, to contain the spread and address the impact of Covid-19 have had significant direct and indirect effects on businesses and commerce generally, including disruptions to supply chain, workforce, transactional activity, facility operation and production. While restrictions on the conduct of business in many jurisdictions, including the closure of workplaces determined to be non-essential, have eased or been lifted, there remain certain restrictions on the international, national and local movement of people and goods, which continue to disrupt many of our clients’ business operations and their recruitment needs. The extent and scope of such restrictions continue to be highly uncertain and subject to change, and stricter measures could potentially be put in place in the future. A prolonged continuance of this public health crisis could therefore have a material adverse effect, including materially increased volatility in financial markets and significant worsening of the global, European, Belgian, Dutch, German and French macroeconomic outlooks. The spread of Covid-19 has led us to modify certain of our operational practices, and we may take further actions required by authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our in-house employees, job candidates and other stakeholders. We implemented a work-from-home policy that has been used by most of our in-house employees. For the Group’s in-house employees who cannot work remotely, we have implemented additional protective procedures, including equipping employees with ----- sanitizing equipment (such as disinfectants and hand sanitizers), implementing social distancing, staggering employees working hours as required to comply with governmental restrictions, and increasing the frequency of cleaning in the Group’s facilities, but these measures may not prevent the exposure of our in-house employees to Covid-19. For job candidates on assignment with a client, many of the markets in which we operate still place certain responsibilities on us for overseeing certain health and safety obligations for our job candidates. See “Regulation.” As a result, for certain job candidates who have been placed in client workplaces where exposure to Covid-19 is possible, we may be subject to risk of liability should such employees allege their workplaces failed to adequately mitigate the risk of exposure to Covid-19. Since we also place job candidates and certain employees with our clients, it is also possible that one of our job candidates or employees with Covid-19 could then infect other employees at the clients’ premises, which could lead to sickness, shutdowns or late deliveries at a client’s business. Clients may hold us liable should we not have taken the required precautionary measures with such job candidates or employees and it could also cause reputational harm to us should any such events occur. In addition, in order to facilitate remote working arrangements, some of our job candidates are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems, which could increase cybersecurity risks to our clients for which they may hold us liable. The intersection of public health, workplace safety, employer liability and privacy laws is complex, and we cannot predict how regulatory or liability regimes may evolve in the future as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although we have seen a full recovery of our financial performance in 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we cannot predict the impact that any future developments relating to the Covid19 pandemic may have on the demand for our staffing services and on our business, results of operations and financial position. These developments may include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of Covid-19, its severity, emergence of new variants and further actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the rate of deployment of vaccines. A number of measures taken by governments in the early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic intended to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 caused dramatic disruptions to our clients businesses and impacted the demands for our staffing services in 2020, in particular in the non-food retail, hotel, restaurant and cafe, aerospace, travel and tourism and automobile industries. Future waves of Covid-19 may result in national or local governments reviving such severe countermeasures. For example, in the spring of 2020 different degrees of lockdowns were introduced in each of our primary geographic markets which had an immediate impact on demand for our staffing services. Softer lockdowns were introduced again in the autumn of 2020 which also led to a decrease in job candidates at work after we had experienced a gradual increase in the number of job candidates at work following the initial lockdown in the spring of 2020. Governmental countermeasures eased again in early 2021, which led to the gradual normalization of economic activities in our primary geographic markets, recovering to pre-Covid-19 levels. This trend was carried into 2022 despite the outbreak of the new strain of Covid-19, Omicron, in the last weeks of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022. Governments could, however, impose similar or more stringent restrictions again in the future as they deem necessary, and this could lead to economic distress and reduced demand for our staffing services, which could affect our results of operations. Potential future lockdown measures, such as shutting down production facilities and offices or restricting free movement of transportation and distribution, closing of restaurant and bar facilities, closing or reducing hospitality at events, amongst others, could disrupt our client’s businesses or ours more significantly in the future than what has been experienced to date, leading them to curtail their reliance on us. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, there were a number of government measures introduced, including in our primary markets of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, which positively contributed to the Group’s ability to manage cash flows during the period and manage the costs associated with our in-house employees and job candidates. For example, we utilized temporary unemployment measures introduced that have allowed us to retain certain in-house employees and job candidates without bearing the full expense of their wages and salaries and have utilized certain postponement of VAT or other tax and benefit payments. A number of these measures, however, ended during the course of 2021, and the remaining measures expired as of July 2022. While this has, to date, only resulted in a minor impact on our costs, we could experience additional costs and liabilities and ----- may also find it more difficult to retain in-house employees and job candidates if demand for our staffing services reduces or is variable due to a resurgence of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate, without the introduction of additional government measures (or which there is no guarantee any will be introduced). If any of the foregoing were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,"Inflation, changes in regulation and other macroeconomic factors may lead to increase in our operating costs that we may not always be able to pass on to our customers, which could adversely affect our profitability.","Certain of our contracts with clients may provide for fixed pricing rates for the services to be provided, a cap on pricing or other terms which we negotiate based on our assumptions regarding our clients’ required scope of services, costs that will be incurred to fulfill the scope and operational efficiencies we expect to achieve and other estimates. As a result, while we seek to pass on our costs to our clients, this may not be feasible in all situations. These assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate, particularly if operating costs continue to rise in the current inflationary environment, as well as due to other increases in our costs driven by changes in regulation, increased competition in the labor market, changes to economic conditions, other costs beyond our control or other developments, and as a result, our margins under these contracts may be materially adversely affected. In particular, we may be unable to pass on increases in costs due to a change in regulation governing minimum wage requirements, payments required to be made under social security and other benefits which could affect our profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2021, personnel expenses and wage taxes, in aggregate, constituted 85.1% of our cost of services. Although we seek to structure our arrangements with third parties on a back-to-back basis with the related customer arrangements, for example, by entering into agreements with job candidates with durations and termination rights that are coterminous with the duration of our contracts with the relevant clients, there may be instances where we are not able to offset or transfer such costs to our clients. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.4,The employment services sector is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully in our markets.,"Our industry is highly competitive. This is driven by a variety of factors, including low barriers to entry especially in localized markets, the availability of qualified job candidates, the quality and speed of customer service, and brand loyalty. We compete in a number of our markets with large, consolidated international staffing services providers and smaller, more localized companies. Many of our competitors are global full-service and specialized employment services providers with substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. For example, our Accent Powerhouse which operates in the specialized talent solutions segment in Belgium, faces competition from global service providers, each of which compete mainly on volume-driven clients. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. We may also face increased competition from smaller, more localized staffing solutions providers. Such firms would most likely cater to a smaller set of clients and as a result, may be able to provide more time and attention to their clients. In particular, SME and ISEs may prefer to work with more localized firms. Moreover, there is a risk that we may be unable to compete effectively on price with such firms as their cost base may be lower, including regarding technological capabilities. In addition, new and existing competitors may be aided by technology that enables them to compete with our staffing services. The widespread adoption of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of staffing companies obsolete. Specifically, the increased use of the internet may continue to attract technology-oriented companies to ----- the staffing industry. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook and online job boards such as Google for Jobs are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing company. We believe that our future success will depend largely upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with these and other technological and digital developments and advances. Current or future competitors could develop alternative capabilities and technologies that are more effective, efficient, easier to use or more economical than our services. In addition, with continuing development and increased availability of information technology, the end-markets in which we compete may attract new competitors. If our capabilities and technologies do not keep up with advances, become obsolete or uncompetitive, this may lead to increased costs or not being able to find and match the right job candidates for clients, which may lead to loss of revenues and market share. We may face competition from our clients themselves as they insource or make alternative arrangements for some of the services we provide. SMEs and ISEs have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our sales. As such clients grow, they may increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives, including developing and using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party to support them in their staffing needs. Moreover, our clients, particularly our large corporate clients, may increasingly look for off-shore or near-shore labor markets as alternative sources for staffing as opposed to our staffing services, and such trend could accelerate as a result of the increase in remote working as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, there is a risk that we may not be able to maintain our existing client engagements and if we are not able to maintain or replace such clients, this could negatively impact our business. Due to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our services, loss of market share, and loss of clients. Our inability to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of any of the foregoing and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.5,Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified job candidates and in-house employees.,"Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified job candidates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients, particularly for the specialized positions that we place under both our engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions segments. Given the current global labor shortage in our primary markets, we may experience an increasingly tight labor market with low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable to meet our clients’ requirements in identifying an adequate number of job candidates. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified job candidates to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. Competition for individuals with proven specialty skills is often intense, and we expect demand for such individuals could make it difficult to retain such job candidates. Qualified job candidates may not be available to us in sufficient numbers or on terms of employment acceptable to us. In addition, we may lose existing job candidates to clients, if such clients decide to permanently retain our job candidates sent on temporary assignment, including as a result of legislative or regulatory reform. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organizations job candidates from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions and skill sets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify job candidates with the required attributes, including as a result of expanding restrictions on immigration or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills to meet the demand where needed. We may also face difficulties in recruiting job candidates through our international recruitment network if such job candidates are not incentivized to relocate and seek assignments with clients in the markets in which we operate as a result of increasing wages in their home countries. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has led many job candidates to reevaluate their careers, work conditions and long-term professional goals, resulting in an increased rate of employees switching jobs and transitioning between different job modes. While this has led employers to focus more intensely than ever on employee retention and job mobility, which has created substantial opportunities for us to offer our services, there is no guarantee that we will be able to ----- capitalize on this trend. Employers and employees have also grown to be versatile during the Covid-19 pandemic and companies could seek to leverage flexible working arrangements to utilize their current employees to fill their staffing needs instead of seeking our services. Further, we are also dependent on our in-house employees to establish and maintain client relationships, to recruit job candidates, to run our day-to-day operations and to identify internal growth and external acquisition opportunities. A number of our Powerhouses rely on in-house employees who are specialists in the end-markets of the clients we serve with a deep understanding of the job requirements of our clients. Such qualified in-house employees may not continue to be available to us in sufficient numbers or on terms or in geographic locations which are economically and strategically advantageous to us. Moreover, we may be unable to continue to find, develop or retain suitable in-house employees who meet our performance standards.

For example, rapid changes in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve, and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the staffing industry and for our business. There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant disruption to our business model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively. Additionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to invest in or develop particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business. In particular, we have developed several digital staffing solutions in recent years, and we intend to continue to invest in our digital initiatives. There is a risk that our digital initiatives will be unsuccessful as we may be unable to cater these digital solutions to the needs of employers or candidates, develop the technical aspects of these digital solutions quickly enough to keep pace with market trends or implement them effectively. Furthermore, we operate on a best practices basis, meaning that we implement digital initiatives more broadly among our Group once they have been tested by a Powerhouse, which may lead to delayed implementation of, and as a result, delayed benefit from, such initiatives. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on the appeal of our services and solutions, or our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace and, as a result, on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Accordingly, we face risks relating to our ability to continue to attract, retain and incentivize senior management and other key personnel in our company. If any senior management or key personnel leave, it could take time to find appropriately qualified individuals to replace them especially considering the specialized nature of our business and the current tight labor market. If we are unable to retain key members of our senior management team in particular and cannot hire new qualified personnel in a timely manner, this could negatively impact the management of our Powerhouses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

We believe that maintaining, protecting and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, useful and innovative services to our clients and our ability to successfully match job candidates with our clients’ needs. If clients or job candidates do not perceive our staffing services to be of high quality, our reputation could be harmed and the value of our brands could diminish, thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our staffing services to existing and prospective clients as well as job candidates. We also believe that our reputation and brands may be harmed if we fail to maintain a consistently high level of customer service. Our reputation and brand could also be negatively affected by the actions of clients or job candidates that are inappropriate or illegal, regardless of whether such actions relate to services we provide to such clients or arise while a job candidate is on assignment with a client if we are publicly associated with such actions. In addition, clients or job candidates may become dissatisfied with our billing policies, our handling of personal data or other aspects of our staffing services. If we fail to adequately address these or other complaints, negative publicity about us or our services could diminish confidence in and the use of our staffing services. Our image or reputation can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if an incident receives considerable negative publicity or results in litigation, and such litigation may also directly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of these incidents may include: - problematic in-house employee or job candidate behavior, such as social discrimination, violent behavior and sexual harassment, or disagreements or disputes with clients, job candidates or in-house employees; - placing job candidates who do not, or are alleged to not, have the requisite background or experience; - accidents that take place both within our own premises or at client sites; or - breaches or allegations of breaches of legal and regulatory obligations. Other incidents that may generate negative publicity or harm our reputation or brands may arise from events that are or may be beyond our control, such as data security breaches or fraudulent activities associated with our records, work accidents relating to job candidates placed with our clients, litigation and legal claims or third-party misappropriation, dilution or infringement of our intellectual property. For example, adverse publicity relating to workplace accidents, including serious injuries or fatal accidents, could have a negative impact on our business, including loss of existing job candidates or inhouse employees, loss of clients or regulatory action. Furthermore, negative publicity relating to the temporary staffing industry, the use of foreign workers, the housing of foreign workers or immigration/worker mobility more generally or the staffing industry more generally, whether or not directly or indirectly related to any specific events arising from our own operations, could harm our reputation through association, particularly if such negative publicity references us as an operator in ----- such industry or makes any of our clients or job candidates reluctant to use our services as a result. For example, in the past, we received negative publicity and were subject to litigation related to the failure of a third party to provide adequate housing arrangements for job candidates who were recruited through our international recruitment network. In addition, our German subsidiary SOLCOM has faced negative publicity in the past in connection with a dissatisfied former shareholder. Failure to address, or appearing to fail to address, these and other issues could erode client confidence in our reputation or the brands of our Powerhouses. Restoring our reputation may be costly and difficult to achieve. Negative publicity or negative public opinion may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract clients or job candidates, or increase the costs of attracting and maintaining our client and job candidate base, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

In engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology and systems and those of thirdparty vendors we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and social media. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable or sensitive data or other operational failures may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failures, in-house employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our inhouse employees, vendors or third parties, or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations. Computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and could occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts by third parties to fraudulently induce our in-house employees or job candidates to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or systems. An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical failure could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Furthermore, we are subject to specific regulations regarding the use of personal data. Those regulations generally impose certain requirements on the Group in respect of the collection, retention, use and processing of such personal information. Specifically in the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) came into force and has applied directly to the legislation of all EU Member States since May 25, 2018, replacing historical EU data privacy laws, and implements more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data. Moreover, there are a large amount of socalled opening clauses, which could lead to differences between implementations of the GDPR in European Union Member States. The implementation of these requirements of the GDPR is a burden on the Group’s legal and compliance functions, in particular for international data transfers as they occur in our business. The task to meet all the GDPR requirements is relatively complex. Therefore, it is possible that we may be found to fail to meet certain requirements of the GDPR and its implementations by the Member States. In case we are found to infringe provisions set out in the GDPR, sanctions may be imposed. Our failure to implement the GDPR (including the implementing rules of the EU Member States) could affect our reputation and relationships with our clients, or result in ----- regulatory action against us for the infringement of data protection rules, any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. The GDPR imposes administrative fines for data protection compliance violations of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of the company’s global annual turnover. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws or contractual obligations, or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and this could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we seek to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the relevant data protection regulations by our inhouse employees and job candidates and any third-party service providers, and also implement security measures to help prevent cyber theft, we nonetheless are exposed to the risk that this data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, stolen or processed in breach of data protection legislation. Managing these risks have become more difficult in connection with working-from-home policies that we adopted in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic and exposes us to additional risk for which additional work, licenses and expertise is needed to detect and prevent the occurrences from happening. Ransomware and cyber risks have increased in general during the Covid-19 pandemic and have also required us to invest in even more strict back-up procedures, leading to higher operating costs for all of its information technologies. In addition, concerns regarding our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in negative publicity and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Like many businesses, we and our third-party suppliers have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, system disruptions that impact our IT systems. Any disruptions, outages or delays in our IT systems, including as a result of fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical or electronic break-ins, earthquakes, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other events or disruptions, could affect the availability of our services and prevent or inhibit the ability of our in-house employees, clients or job candidates to access and utilize our systems or services. Moreover, we and our third-party suppliers may not be able to anticipate evolving techniques used to effect security breaches (which change frequently and may not be known to us until launched), or prevent attacks by hackers, including phishing, ransomware attacks or other cyber-attacks, or prevent breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, in a timely manner, or at all. Cyber-attacks have become far more prevalent in recent years, potentially leading to unauthorized access to, misuse or disclosure of, unavailability of, or the theft or manipulation of confidential and proprietary information, including information regarding our clients and job candidates, as well as loss of access to, or destruction of, data on our or third-party systems. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our IT systems or could cause them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur.

These solutions may be unprofitable if we are not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in implementing these solutions. For example, we may fail to structure and utilize our solutions in a manner that properly compensates us for the IT development costs associated with such innovations. With respect to acquisitions, we regularly review and pursue opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions, including as a way to expand to new geographical areas and new market sectors. We may face difficulties in identifying suitable target businesses or consummating a transaction on terms that are favorable to us.

Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. These risks include, but are not limited to: - diversion of management’s time and attention from daily operations to the integration of newly acquired operations; - the possibility of not being able to retain key staff members and clients from the companies we acquire; - difficulties in conforming the acquired company’s accounting, books and records, internal controls, and procedures and policies to ours; - retaining the loyalty and business of the clients of acquired businesses; - challenges arising from a lack of familiarity with new markets with differing commercial and social norms and customs which may adversely impact our strategic goals or require us to adapt our business model for and other regulatory frameworks; - compliance with foreign legal and regulatory systems; - difficulties integrating technologies and maintaining uniform standards; - unforeseen legal, regulatory, anti-trust, pension liabilities, other contractual matters or other issues; - difficulties in maintaining timeliness and quality of service; and - unanticipated costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to discover or fully assess any or all potential costs or liabilities associated with any future acquisition. Furthermore, we have in the past and expect in the future to operate and acquire businesses in countries or markets where we are not currently present, with different regulatory systems and different operating cultures, which may exacerbate the risks identified above. In addition, acquisitions are also subject to the risk of overvaluation of the target and thus to the payment of consideration greater than the targets’ actual value to our business.

Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites may be negatively affected. Moreover, a search or metasearch engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing a website to place lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of our websites, or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization, search engine marketing or other traffic-generating arrangements in a negative manner, it may lead to the loss of existing job candidates or clients or hamper our ability to attract new job candidates or clients. In addition, certain meta-search companies have added or intend to add various forms of functionality to their sites. To the extent such functionality is promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings, this may reduce the amount of traffic to our websites. We also attract job candidates as well as new clients through paid marketing channels. In order to maintain our current revenues and grow our business, we need to continually optimize advertising campaigns, and paid search engine optimization aimed at acquiring new job candidates and clients. Social media and online job boards have been an effective way for us to reach passive job seeker candidates and our success in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to promote our staffing services on third-party websites, such as Facebook, Google for Jobs and Indeed.com to whom we pay fees to advertise. If one of the advertisers or social media platforms to which we direct online advertising expenditures, use to promote our services or locate potential clients, were to increase their fees, change their interface or experience disruptions in service, we may be required to incur additional advertising expenses to acquire job candidates and clients. Furthermore, if any significant third-party websites or platforms on which we advertise, promote our services or locate potential clients were to lose their market position or otherwise fall out of favor with consumers or other factors cause their user bases to stop growing or shrink, we may need to identify alternative channels for advertising and promoting our staffing services, which could consume substantial resources and may not be effective, or available at all.

In addition, due to regulatory requirements, our job candidates in Germany are also our employees with indefinite term contracts and on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. In light of the above, the utilization of such job candidates (i.e., the time that can be billed to a client assignment) has a significant impact on the generation of our revenue. If such job candidates are underutilized, we will not be generating revenue, but we will continue to incur costs for these job candidates. Accordingly, the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a client assignment, or “bench time,” has an impact on our profitability. The degree to which we are able to utilize and manage our job candidates is affected by a number of factors, including: - our ability to forecast demand for our services and to recruit, maintain and deploy job candidates in alignment with demand, including job candidates with the right mix of skills and experience to support client demand; - our ability to transition job candidates from completed client engagements to new assignments and to hire, assimilate and deploy new job candidates; - our ability to manage retention; - our ability to engage and motivate our job candidates and their level of productivity; and - performance, including through seeking out new clients engagements or extending existing clients engagements. A number of these factors have been more difficult to manage as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although our business activities have been restored to or surpassed pre-Covid-19 levels, a number of our clients may still be uncertain of their staffing needs or hesitant to renew assignments for job candidates as the Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way how job candidates approach working. The war in Ukraine and the potential economic impact, as well as the global inflation and supply chain shortage have also caused uncertainties on how companies fill their staffing requirements. Furthermore, while temporary unemployment government measures implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic allowed us to manage certain of our costs that come from underutilized job candidates, a number of these measures, however, ended during the course of 2021, and the remaining measures expired as of July 2022. Moreover, the significant economic volatility in today’s market, despite the recovery in GDP growth for our geographical market following the Covid-19 pandemic, may lead to a reduction in the funding and/or willingness of customers to engage us for our services, which could in turn lead to an increase in underutilized job candidates. Increased direct costs (resulting from salary inflation for existing or new job candidates or an increase in headcount for our job candidates as part of our growth strategy or otherwise) without a corresponding increase in revenue could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit. While it is important for us to manage our additional client assignments or higher priced job candidate costs to maintain our gross margin, a failure to increase pay in line with our competitors could restrict our ability to attract new job candidates and retain existing job candidates, which could impact the quality of the services we provide to clients and our ability to win new or to maintain existing client relationships. If our costs increase at a higher rate than our revenue, whether due to factors that lead to less revenue (including as a result of our job candidates being underutilized) or factors that lead to increased costs, we may not be as competitive and profitability will be impacted.

We have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to seasonal demand in our current end-markets. Seasonality varies depending on a number of different factors and can impact our Powerhouses and our two business segments differently. The underlying end-markets we serve are subject to various drivers that impact overall industry demand and therefore demand from our clients for staffing. For example, the construction industry may experience inclement weather or other causes on a worksite, which can impact demand for job candidates. As a result of the mix of services we provide, seasonal work can also cause a peak in demand during a specific period, such as the weeks leading up to Christmas and Easter, around harvest time in the food production sector or around holiday periods such as the Christmas holidays and summer holidays. Historically, as a general matter, our revenue fluctuates, with higher levels of revenue typically being received in the second half of the year just after the summer holidays, which is then sustained for a period before decreasing again in December due to Christmas holidays. We also present certain unaudited monthly revenue and _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA financial information in this Offering Memorandum for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 derived from management accounts, which typically display more seasonality and may be subject to adjustment at quarter-end, and therefore investors should exercise caution when placing reliance thereon. Moreover, we also experience seasonality with regard to our working capital requirements. We generally experience larger working capital requirements in the first half of the year due to increased holiday pay, bonus pay and tax payments. While our working capital requirements are generally lower in the second half of the year, our working capital requirements also experience an increase at the end of the year for end-of year bonuses and holiday pay, particularly as certain of our businesses institute mandatory holiday at the end of the year. Furthermore, our results during 2020 were also impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected the traditional seasonality patterns experienced by the Group with respect to revenue and with respect to working capital (with a number of governments granting postponements to certain tax or other expenses and providing grants for certain unemployment support that temporarily decreased the Group’s working capital needs) compared to previous years.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

As of December 31, 2021 and as of September 30, 2022, trade receivables constituted 11.6% and 13.8%, respectively, of our total assets. Successful control of the trade receivables process demands the development of appropriate credit, collection, and financing policies. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk, meaning the risk that our clients and other counter-parties may be unable to fulfill their payment obligations. Macroeconomic conditions have a significant influence on credit risk, as in an economic downturn more clients tend to fall into default, which could be magnified for us as a result of our exposure to SME and ISE clients, which may have less ability to raise capital from other sources during a downturn. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate, a number of businesses, particularly small businesses, have been supported by government measures. It cannot be excluded that as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues or once these government measures expire, such businesses, including our clients supported by such measures, may face cash flow shortages or bankruptcy, which could impact our ability to collect trade receivables in a timely manner or at all, particularly for those receivables which would not be covered by the Group’s credit insurance, which has a maximum liability amount of up to €250.0 million and is held by all of our Powerhouses, except for Cohedron and TMI. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer. We are also exposed to counterparty risk with respect to certain credit insurance maintained by certain of our business units, swap agreements we have entered into in respect of interest payments as well as factoring agreements (for which our Group retains a credit risk and late payments risk). Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses and defaults. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by one or more of our counterparties. If we fail to maintain a solid collections policy or to manage our credit risk or if there were such an economic downturn in the markets in which we operated or an impact on the financial services markets including our counterparties, such a failure or event could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

We may, however, become subject to liability against which we have not been insured, cannot insure or are insufficiently insured, such as employment practices liability, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, to the extent any claims arise during a job candidate’s assignment with a client which we expected the clients’ insurance to cover and it does not, we may face uninsured losses in connection with any such events. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new insurance agreements on commercially acceptable terms and conditions in the future. For example, our business units in Belgium are required to insure occupational accidents through specifically licensed private insurance companies, as a consequence of the Law of April 10, 1971 and subsequent Royal Decrees. Furthermore, following the outbreak of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate, a number of insurance companies have increased or may attempt to raise insurance prices, which we may not be able to fully recover by passing along these increased expenses in our negotiations of client contracts and fees for our job candidates’ services. Given the nature of our operations, which typically results in us placing our job candidates on our payroll while they are on assignment, we are required to insure a significant number of persons. Since 2021, a variable premium rate has been applied to our work accident insurance, with a base premium rate of 2.918%, a mid-case rate of 3.064% and ----- worst-case rate of 3.097%, depending on the number of work accidents we have. This premium is calculated based on the gross salary mass of our temporary workers. For 2021, we estimate that the mid-case rate will apply, although the base premium rate could potentially still apply depending on the recovery process of the individuals involved in work accidents, which would have a significant impact on the calculation of the final compensation to be paid out and therefore impact the premium rate that will be applied to us. We also estimate that the mid-case rate will apply for 2022, and at the moment we are on course for the base premium rate; however, this expectation could change drastically depending on any further occurrences of work accident in the remainder of 2022. The materialization of any of these risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.20,Changes in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect demand for our services.,"From time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies, governments and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted by staffing services, particularly temporary staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups, or regulatory agencies, or alternatively due to increased use of and preference for online job platforms and other digital intermediaries which results in decreased demand for our services from clients, we could experience a decline in revenue. For example, temporary staffing is generally impermissible in Germany without a valid permit from the relevant authorities, and there can be no guarantee that regulations in our other primary markets will not change in the future to prohibit the same. Also, new legislation has come into effect in the Netherlands requiring employment housing to remain available for four weeks following the end of employment of foreign workers, which has also led to an increased focus on separation between employment providers and housing providers. While this separation is not currently legally required, we expect it will be enforced in the future. Notwithstanding the above, there is currently no clear indication as to the extent of what the required separation will be, and we cannot be certain at this time whether a complete separation, or a full ban on the provision of housing to temporary workers by employment agencies, will be legally required in the future and how that would impact the demand for our services. In addition, the use of foreign workers by the staffing industry is also criticized and may receive significant political, media or other attention from time to time. To the extent that this decreases demand for our staffing requires, this could also result in a decline in revenue for the Group. In particular, demand for our services from government and public sector clients related to the Covid19 pandemic may decrease over time. On July 20, 2021, we acquired Cohedron, which primarily advises public authorities and municipalities and is currently a Powerhouse in our engineering and consulting segment. We have increased business from services rendered to the government and public sector clients during the Covid-19 pandemic due to, among other developments, work related to government support measures, such as the TOZO scheme, as well as concerns related to the widespread personal debt issue of the citizens in the Netherlands. The Covid-19 pandemic-related services and other work for government and public sector clients has contributed to our revenue over the past year. It is unknown to what extent business with such clients may decrease as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic lessen or change over time. Demand for our services from government and public sector clients may also fall as clients adapt to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and their needs evolve. We will continue to monitor the situation, but the future impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects on the needs of our clients are impossible to fully predict, and there can be no assurance that our increased business in the government and public sector will be sustained.

As required by IFRS, we test material assets annually for impairment. We have not experienced any material impairments of goodwill during the three years ended December 31, 2021. We performed an impairment test during the second quarter of 2022 given the rising interest rate in the current market, which we consider to be an impairment indicator. Goodwill impairment in relation to the GRITT Powerhouse was identified, as the recoverable amount was €40.9 million compared to the carrying value of €54.2 million. We performed another impairment test during the third quarter of 2022 due to further increases in interest rates, and identified no additional impairments. We therefore recorded a goodwill impairment of €13.3 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2022, as we consider this change to have a long-term impact. If we have any indication that the value of any of our material assets could decline, including indicators such as an economic downturn, the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its consequential economic impact or certain business decisions, this results in an impairment test that could result in impairments of goodwill or of other current or non-current assets, and if any such impairments were substantial, this would negatively impact our operating profit. Any significant charge for impairment in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or result of operations and thus our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In addition, following the Transactions, we will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations). The application of purchase accounting may result in significantly different carrying values for goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Due to these and other potential adjustments, future financial statements for the Group could be materially different and may not be comparable to our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including but not limited to, risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible and tangible assets, increased depreciation and amortization expenses over the remaining lives of the acquired assets and recognition of temporary differences at the acquisition date.

In order to efficiently manage these contractual relationships at each of our business units, we employ general terms and conditions and standard templates in our contracts and forms. Furthermore, certain of our business units work with a number of large corporate clients and are sometimes required to adhere to their standard terms and conditions. As a result of the foregoing, we are exposed to legal risks whenever such contracts contain drafting errors, execution errors (including unsigned agreements), lack sufficient detail on the nature of our liability to the client, require customized terms and conditions, or require additional analysis as to legal sufficiency. Such general terms and conditions, standard contracts and forms used and signed by us may not comply with all the applicable legal requirements at all times. Moreover, as our in-house employees receive incentivelinked pay, they could agree to non-standard terms in a bid to sign on new clients which may expose us to additional liabilities. In addition, certain agreements with our clients contain indemnifications and hold harmless obligations in favor of our clients. We are not always able to contractually exclude or limit such potential claims and certain of our contracts therefore bear the risk of uncapped liability, including certain agreements with our large corporate clients.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.23,A significant portion of our revenue is derived from SME and ISE clients and we could be negatively impacted by the costs associated by providing such service or adverse market conditions or other factors that affect our SME and ISE clients.,"Our client portfolio is mainly composed of SMEs and ISEs, which have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our sales. Key challenges we face in providing services to the SME and ISE market include: - serving as the expert in staffing needs to organizations that often lack internal HR resources and ensuring our services meet their needs in terms of support, flexible decision making and excellence in customer service; - devoting resources to advise our SME and ISE clients on compliance with applicable labor regulations, including health and safety requirements; - investing in client relationships takes time and staffing assignments with SMEs and ISEs may require more of such investment since typical average staffing needs may be for only one to two job candidates at a time; and - devoting significant resources to developing services tailored to their needs, standards and specific requirements. Furthermore, an economic downturn in the end-markets in which our SME and ISE clients operate could have a negative impact on the demand for our services or the prices such clients are willing to pay for our services. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the results of operations and financial viability of SMEs and ISEs as many have had their trading interrupted due to lockdowns and typically businesses of such size have difficulty accessing debt and equity financing. Although certain government programs have been established to assist SMEs and ISEs, we can provide no assurance that these schemes will be sufficient and a number of them have been, or may be in the future discontinued, and as a result many SMEs and ISEs may be in danger of closing. Therefore, while lockdown measures have lifted or eased, many of our SME and ISE clients may still be facing significant difficulties in recovering from the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The current inflationary environment may also pose further financial pressure on our SME and ISE clients as they may be less likely to be able to pass-through higher operational costs to their customers, which may impact their demand for our services or the prices they are willing to pay us. As a result, our focus on SMEs and ISEs could result in additional costs to the Group as compared to our peers that are less focused on the SME and ISE market. Conditions or developments that affect SMEs and ISEs in particular, which may be related to macroeconomic factors, including inflation, regulatory developments, consumer trends or other factors leading to a material decline in SMEs’ and ISEs’ demand for staffing services could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Relating to Legal Matters and the Regulatory Environment,13.2.1,We are subject to extensive laws and regulations which may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may reduce our future earnings.,"In many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Belgium and Germany, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. These laws and regulations sometimes limit the size and growth of ----- employment services industries in these countries. Some of the laws and regulations impact directly our profitability; for example, the 2008 EU Directive of Temporary Agency Work seeks to guarantee those working through staffing solutions providers equal pay and conditions with employees in the same business who perform the same job duties, which led to an increase in our cost of services. Some other laws and regulations restrict our sector expansion; for example, the use of staffing services by staffing solutions providers in the local construction end-market is prohibited in Germany. Furthermore, in April 2017, Germany enacted legislation introducing equal pay for temporary workers as well as restricting the length of temporary employment to 18 months, which led to a downturn in our business and an adverse impact to our operating results due to the overtaking of temporary workers by clients, and which legislation has continued to have an impact in subsequent periods. While we have systems and processes in place to monitor our compliance with such laws, it is possible such systems could fail which could have a negative impact on our financial results or reputation. In addition, substantial changes to Dutch law governing temporary staffing came into effect from January 1, 2020. These changes to regulation had some impact on our business, as they resulted in the costs for temporary work increasing. For example, there are increased social security charges for temporary staffing agencies in their capacity as employer, and we expect a formal separation between employment providers and housing providers will be legally required in the future. Furthermore, payroll employees will be entitled to all terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions, and a temporary employment clause and the additional flexibility to enter into fixed term employment agreements that are traditionally allowed are no longer applicable to payroll employees. As a result of these regulations coming into effect in 2020, our cost of services has increased, but we also simultaneously increased our sales prices for our job candidates’ services. While to date we have been able to pass on the majority of these increases in costs to our clients through higher fees charged for our services, this nevertheless leads to an increased cost for our services at clients, which may lead to clients questioning the relatively higher cost of temporary/flexible staffing versus hiring permanent employees, thus reducing their demand for our services. The impact of these changes cannot yet be fully ascertained as it is still evolving following the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and while companies have demonstrated increased demand for hiring flexibility in the current market, many of them have also become more focused on cost savings, leading to less use of temporary work. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our job candidates. For example, as a consequence of certain legal restrictions, certain deductions are not allowed if the net salary paid to job candidates falls below minimum wage as a result. For these nondeductible costs, we send invoices to the workers. If workers do not pay their invoices and return to their country of origin, we are left with the costs. Furthermore, changes in zoning regulations or their interpretation could result in increased costs in order to house our job candidates. Covid-19 related government measures relating to quarantine regulations and separate housing requirements for job candidates at certain of our Powerhouses have also resulted in increased housing costs for job candidates. Additionally, trade unions may use the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expenses associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing workforce solutions. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in our business. Furthermore, many countries are also expanding restrictions on immigration and have introduced substantial penalties that may be imposed on staffing solutions providers and their client for employing foreign workers without necessary work and residence permits. As a result, there is a risk that we may incur greater expense in connection with restrictions imposed on recruiting foreign workers. In addition, the countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things: - create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide; - require that new or additional benefits be paid to our job candidates; ----- - increase payroll related costs such as general and medical insurance, workers’ compensation; - require us to comply with additional social laws, including in relation to collective bargaining procedures; - require us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; - limit the circumstances under which temporary staff may be employed; - reclassify the status or categorization of our job candidates under applicable social laws which would require us to comply with additional requirements, including payment of additional welfare benefits; or - increase taxes such as sales or value-added taxes. In some countries, we are able to utilize laws, regulations or governmental measures that incentivize work and employment through governmental support programs, subsidies or other specific measures which help generate demand for our staffing services and provide opportunities for us to place job candidates or to be reimbursed for certain of their wages or salary costs by placing them in work. These governmental programs include those supporting shift work, night work, students and training, amongst others. If these programs are discontinued, there may be less demand for our staffing services. In addition, should we or the administrator responsible for such programs determine as a result of reviews, control procedures or otherwise that any of our job candidates or the work opportunity do not meet the eligibility criteria for such programs after we have placed them, we may not be eligible for any subsidies for such job candidates’ wages or salaries or we could be required to reimburse the government for any subsidies that were already received, which could have a negative impact on our profits. Furthermore, we also benefitted from temporary government measures introduced as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which have since expired and such expiration resulted in limited increased costs to the Group. Any future regulations or interpretations from administrations thereof may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations because they may make it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services (such as by increasing employment taxes), particularly if we cannot pass on increases in costs to our clients. For example, on December 17, 2020, the Dutch government approved a new law that aims to curb nitrogen emission, which has had an impact on the Dutch agricultural sector given the country’s large amount of livestock, and, in turn, caused the demand of our job candidates in this sector to fluctuate. Belgium has also passed similar nitrogen emission-related legislation, which could have an adverse impact on our business there as well. In addition, on April 21, 2021, the European Commission presented a proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), which would amend the existing reporting requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and encourage corporate spending towards sustainable activities across the EU. The European Council approved the CSRD on November 28, 2022 and the application of the regulation is expected to take place in four stages, the first of which will require companies that already fall under the CSRD to complete their first CSRD reporting on the financial year 2024, with expected reporting deadlines in 2025. We expect that we will be required to comply with the CSRD. We cannot guarantee how the new Dutch nitrogen regulation, the CSRD or any other existing or potential environmental regulations will impact our governance structure and our day-today business activities. Future changes to regulations may have more stringent requirements that could increase our cost of operations or impact the demand of our services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and in turn impact our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable regulations or requirements occur. In the event of non-compliance, our existing permits and licenses may be revoked or we may be subject to a fine, and re-application for such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. For example, we are currently being investigated by Belgian authorities for allegedly providing residential housing units that do not meet the required quality of living standards. On October 31, 2022, the court of first instance ruled in our favor, but the prosecutor has appealed and we expect the court of appeal to hear the case in 2023. Although we believe any potential financial fines resulting from such investigations would not be material to our overall business, such investigation could lead to a potential review and change of status of our temporary worker agency license. Should the status of our license change, some of our clients might prefer not to work with us until our license is restored to its previous status. Certain of our licenses are also subject to periodic renewal. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

As a result, our job candidates working in these end-markets, including, in particular the construction, infrastructure and defense sectors, may be subject to accidents at work, some of which have in the past and could in the future, result in injuries, including severe ones causing disability or even death. In certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be liable to our job candidates for damages or subject to regulatory action as a result of unsafe working conditions at the client’s premises. We could also be liable toward our job candidates or subject to regulatory action or loss of our license to the extent we do not meet legal requirements with respect to such placement, for example submitting job candidates to a medical examination for applicable placements in advance of the job candidate beginning work. Furthermore, any failures of such standards by our clients or ourselves that generate adverse publicity could have a negative impact on our reputation and our ability to attract future business, result in the loss of existing job candidates affected by any such behavior or otherwise harm our business or operations.

These may include possible claims by clients or regulatory bodies against us relating to: - classification of temporary workers; - employment of undocumented workers; - failing to verify job candidates’ backgrounds and qualifications; - job candidates’ misconduct or negligence; or - fraudulent or criminal job candidate activities or misuse of client proprietary information. We may also be subject to claims by job candidates or regulatory bodies (including in relation to actions of our clients or any third parties that we hire). Some of these may include claims relating to: - violations of labor laws such as minimum wage requirements: - discrimination and harassment; - wrongful termination or denial of employment; - violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; - violation of social laws, such as provision of adequate housing for foreign workers; or - payment of workers’ compensation claims or other health and safety related claims. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we bring claims or may be pursuing other legal or regulatory remedies. We are involved in contractual relationships with our clients and other third parties that may cause us from time to time, by court order or by unilateral action, to enforce our contractual rights against these parties. These claims may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged losses, civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief.

Although we believe that he is not entitled to such additional payment as a result of him having been dismissed for cause, should he prevail in his claim, our maximum potential exposure is €15.0 million. A decision is expected during the course of the first quarter of 2023. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” In addition, SOLCOM has been a subject in investigations by customs authorities in relation to suspected de-facto employment of freelancers. The investigations were closed in 2021, and while it was concluded that no criminal offenses were committed and none of the freelancers were deemed employees, we paid a total of €4.0 million to the German pension insurance and the public prosecutor’s office in 2021 to minimize procedural costs. Accent was also challenged in 2017 by the Belgian tax authorities for an alleged tax fraud relating to a Luxembourgish construction in for activities prior to 2014, which Accent ultimately settled with the Belgian tax authorities. Furthermore, there is currently a pending case before the European Court of Justice regarding certain German staffing legislations, which stems from a law suit against TIMEPARTNER concerning a labor law violation, which TIMEPARTNER previously won in two instances. All parties involved in this case have provided statements, and we believe that the court may take six to 14 months to issue a decision. We may be subject to other litigation and disputes, claims and complaints, including adversarial actions, by clients, in-house employees, suppliers, insurers and others in the ordinary course of business, which may have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or financial position.

We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely on certain license agreements from third parties to utilize software or other intellectual property used within our businesses. For example, certain of our business units rely on proprietary software that we have developed internally or acquired, such as NOWJOBS, SWOP, Book’u, CV Creator, MyTests, Dora, MyTools and Gighouse, as part of our digital initiatives strategy. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services and solutions similar to ours or from using similar software to ours. In certain jurisdictions, such as Belgium, we also rely on a favorable tax regime on copyright incomes to attract creative software developers. In Belgium, an ongoing reform will make the favorable tax regime subject to stricter conditions. This may affect our ability to attract or keep software developers.

The objectives of the due diligence process are to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances relevant to a specific asset, to identify possible risks associated with such asset and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of the acquisition of such asset to drive operational achievement and value creation in such asset. When conducting due diligence, the Sponsor typically evaluates a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsor relies on resources available to it, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions. There may be liabilities that the Sponsor failed or was unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into House of HR and its affiliates in connection with the Acquisition, in particular given the timing constraints for, and the materiality thresholds that have been applied in the context of, the due diligence investigations. Following the Acquisition, the Sponsor may learn of additional information about House of HR and its affiliates that adversely affects it, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement permit, and the Indenture will permit, additional indebtedness to be secured on the Collateral in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Prior to the Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such date of designation (if any), the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then, in certain cases, creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total Topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce. Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to purse within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. Following the transaction security having become enforceable, if (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and (ii) (x) the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that to delay issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds and (y) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles and necessary or desirable to enhance the prospects of achieving the enforcement objectives before the Security Agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors. ----- If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) and is continuing, the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any requirement to first consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors. The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it by a member of the Group. In connection with any enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may request security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees). To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes (such as indebtedness incurred as an additional facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of holders of the Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. Creditors of any future Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Transaction Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released.

In addition, the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Transaction Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Transaction Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions.

See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral following an event of default, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been, or will be, made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. ----- In addition, the Collateral will secure the Facilities and the Bridge Facility and may secure certain future indebtedness of the Group. Not all of our assets will secure the Notes and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its subsidiaries to secure certain indebtedness (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and their restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. While the Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain important exemptions and carve-outs. The Agreed Security Principles that will be set forth in the Indenture will include a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any security provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. See “Description of the _Notes—Security.” Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the security or_ guarantees provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors. The shares and other Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Transaction Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Transaction Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture or incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, holders of such Notes or ----- lenders of such debt would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Other _Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_ In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over such Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.

In the event that any one or more of ----- the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against any of the Guarantors and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Transaction Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each of the Guarantors or security providers under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests, as applicable. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance _and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued, or the Security Interests created, the relevant Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note ----- Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis. Although we believe that the Issuer and the other Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of ----- such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. The Note Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Note Guarantees provided by a GmbH will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document under which any Note Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Transaction Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG. Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH or any other entity incorporated/established under the laws of Germany may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, among others, the third party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third party creditors of the GmbH. As a result, the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts.

In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control would entitle each lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts outstanding to it under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, respectively, and could trigger put rights, mandatory prepayments or accelerations under other existing or future financing arrangements of the Group. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, ----- may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are a leading provider of HR solutions in key European staffing markets, offering end-to-end temporary recruiting and outsourcing services. We supply specialized and niche staffing to primarily small and medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) clients in a diversified range of end-markets. We offer and tailor our services to the staffing needs of our clients through our engineering and consulting segment and specialized talent solutions segment, which are comprised of a well-developed portfolio of ten specialized business units, which we call Powerhouses, across various countries. We also offer digital recruiting through our dedicated platforms, using our digital tools, including, NOWJOBS, SWOP and Gighouse app, targeting low-skilled, high-volume markets with significant roll-out potential. Since our founding, we have expanded from a presence in only Belgium to more than 10 countries in Europe. Corresponding to our geographic expansion, we have also become more diversified in the endmarkets we serve, primarily through our acquisitions in recent years, which provide us with staffing capabilities in additional areas such as pharmaceutical, healthcare, life sciences, government and public administration and technology. As of September 30, 2022, we had 72,296 job candidates at work and approximately 40,858 productive people at work (meaning the number of our job candidates adjusted to reflect a 38 hour per week workweek) and 4,734 in-house full-time equivalent employees. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we had 31,456 unique clients, our Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue was €2,770.0 million and our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA was €330.5 million. Our engineering and consulting segment represents 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. This segment supplies staffing of highly-skilled professionals, such as engineering consultants and financial and insurance specialists, to fill specialized roles in a variety of end-markets, such as financial, industrial, logistics, infrastructure, public administration and construction, and, more recently, fast-evolving and highly resilient sectors such as energy, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and technology. This segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu Professionals, Redmore, GRITT, Cohedron and SOLCOM Powerhouses and has the broadest geographic footprint, with its primary operations in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The engineering and consulting segment assists clients in the search and selection of the right candidate, including for interim management and secondments, and such temporary client assignments generally last for months. The below chart illustrates in blue the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for our engineering and consulting segment. ----- Our specialized talent solutions segment represents 46.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. This segment supplies specialized staffing of high-demand mid-skilled workers for specialized positions, such as clerical positions, carpenters, nurses and machine engineers, as well as blue-collar workers to companies in certain sectors, including construction, retail, finance, food, healthcare and construction. This segment is comprised of our Accent, Covebo, TIMEPARTNER and TMI Powerhouses, with their primary operations in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as branches in countries that form part of their international recruiting networks, which currently operate principally for this segment though we are planning to expand them for our engineering and consulting segment. These international branches provide us with the capability to source foreign candidates to bridge the large gap between the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates, especially as the labor market in our Addressable Markets has tightened over the past few years. The Specialized Talent Solution segment generally delivers job candidates through temporary agencies to clients in a fast and flexible way when they are shorthanded, with duration of job placements typically lasting for weeks, but they could also last hours or months depending on the needs of our clients. The below chart illustrates in pink the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for our Specialized Talent Solution segment. We serve as an intermediary between job candidates and their ultimate employer by matching up candidates that are looking to find a job, gain experience or find variety or flexibility with our clients that are looking for specialist skills, flexible employee arrangements, time and cost efficiencies or to cover peaks or sourcing for particular projects. We source and screen candidates, provide candidate matching services and present candidates to the client. We also assist with the hiring of the candidates by customers, client and candidate retention, provide timesheet, invoicing and payroll services, and regularly follow up with clients. We aim to help our clients at all stages of the recruiting process to relieve their management from the burden of having to seek appropriate job candidates for available positions. To ensure that we are able to tap into skilled workforces, we offer career coaching to job candidates in order to help them find career paths that align with their professional goals, and we provide in-house training to equip them to match the job profiles in which they are interested or that are scarce in the market to increase job candidates’ employability. We also offer support to foreign job candidates, including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance. We enter into employment contracts with the candidates and pay their salaries. We enter into placement contracts with our clients and bill our clients for our services. Our bill-pay spread is a key driver of our profitability and supports our industry-leading gross margins. We maximize bill-pay spread as a result of candidate scarcity, our niche focus, our SME and local customer focus, our premium service offering, our excellence in marketing candidates to jobs and non-solicitation or minimum fee/period protection for candidates in respect of clients. We have strong pricing power driven by contractual dynamics that ensure pass-through of salary increases. Our specialized talent solutions segment benefits from contractual dynamics which allow for an automatic pass-through to clients of price increases, and our business model also allows for limited bench risk because staffing contracts are back-to-back. In our ----- engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with our clients, and we effectively manage to keep our bench time low by matching confirmed upcoming client assignments to candidates. The business model of these two segments has enabled us to establish a track record of margin stability even during challenging economic conditions such as the Covid-19 pandemic and in the inflationary environment in 2022. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we generated 27.6%, 39.8%, 26.0% and 5.5% of our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France,_ respectively. We have branches in the countries where we source job candidates, including Poland, Romania, Spain, Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal. As of September 30, 2022, we had a network of 742 branches and 18 recruitment offices. To complement our physical network of branches and reach new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies, including our SWOP application, our SWOP Recruiter application and our NOWJOBS platform. We have increased our focus on developing digital support growth initiatives for our primary operations to enable us to reach additional job candidates or serve new end-markets in a fully digital manner. We support businesses by providing flexible staffing solutions that are used throughout all stages of the economic cycle, resulting in our resilience during economic downturns. While the economy is strong, the job market tightens meaning that our clients need help sourcing candidates. As markets soften, companies typically shift to a more temporary workforce and need staffing solutions and flexibility. When markets reach the bottom of the cycle, temporary staffing suffers but then is characterized by a quick recovery as temporary employment tends to recover faster than permanent employment. For example, during the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, our business recovered from the early losses in approximately three to six weeks. We also have a highly variable cost base and the ability to pass on wage inflation, which supports the stability of our gross margins. For example, our Like-for-Like Revenue growth (based on the December 31, 2021 perimeter) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 fluctuated significantly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and were 2%, (9)% and 19%, respectively, but we were able to maintain a gross margin of approximately 28% throughout this period. Flexible staffing solutions proved instrumental in the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in a full recovery of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the retail, food retail and hospitality sectors were severely impacted across all our key markets due to lockdowns and other restrictive measures, which led to a significant reduction in our staffing activities in these sectors. Certain sectors, such as logistics and education, however, proved to be less sensitive to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, and clients in these sectors continued to seek our services, particularly for high-skilled, specialized roles. In addition, demand for staffing services from municipalities and government agencies during the Covid-19 pandemic increased due to, among other developments, work related to the administration of government support measures, which we were able to capitalize on given our specialization in this end-market provided by the Cohedron Powerhouse in our engineering and consulting segment. We were founded in 1995 by Philip Cracco and Conny Vandendriessche along with a financial sponsor as a Belgium-based recruiting firm. Originally called Accent, we changed our name to House of HR in 2012. Over the course of 2012 to 2014, Naxicap, a French private equity firm, acquired a majority stake in our business, and we have expanded significantly to become a leading provider of specialized HR solutions in multiple European markets. On November 3, 2022, Bain Capital acquired a majority stake in the Group, with Naxicap, Conny Vandendriessche and management maintaining stakes. See “The _Transactions.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Vijverberg will be added to the Cohedron Powerhouse. - On June 3, 2022, we acquired Sira Consulting, a Dutch consultancy firm specialized in providing consulting services to authorities in the Netherlands on governmental policy, such as ----- calculating the cost of promulgating new legislation. Sira Consulting will be added to the Cohedron Powerhouse. - On July 4, 2022, we acquired Ambulance Zorg+ in an asset deal to supplement the TMI Powerhouse. Ambulance Zorg+ is a Dutch provider of ambulance care personnel. - On July 5, 2022, we acquired Bis People, a Dutch company specialized in flexible employment, secondment of skilled workers, mediation for self-employed workers and recruitment of personnel for building construction and infrastructure operations. Bis People will be added to the Covebo Powerhouse. - On July 28, 2022, we acquired StaffMe, a French digital platform focusing on student employment and which is primarily active in the retail, health, event and hospitality sectors, supplementing our digital NOWJOBS offering. Through this acquisition, we also acquired the other companies of the StaffMe group, including the StaffMe Academy, the first training organization for young entrepreneurs, and the Accelerator, a program of integration through self-employment for those who are far from employment. - On July 28, 2022, we completed the acquisition of LD Personalvermittlung, a German staffing agency with a focus on the placements of physicians to clinics or hospitals to ensure care coverage and absorb peak workloads at these institutions. It currently has a strong geographic focus on the southern German market. LD Personalvermittlung will further reinforce our presence in the healthcare industry and is complementary to avanti, which focuses on the placement of nurses, by operating under a new Powerhouse under our specialized talent solutions segment, House of Care Talents Germany. - On August 25, 2022, we completed the acquisition of FID Service Groep, a Dutch company active in staffing employees in green waste management and providing relevant training to employees, such as the operation of cranes and other machines. FID Service Groep will be added to the Covebo Powerhouse. Below is a timetable of the acquisition activity not included in our consolidation perimeter through September 30, 2022 and undertaken by our Group after September 30, 2022 until the date of this Offering Memorandum: - On October 7, 2022, we acquired Agium, a Dutch company specialized in deploying skilled professionals to support companies in their day-to-day finance and control processes and implementation of structure changes. Agium is expected to operate under our Redmore Powerhouse. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Agium generated revenue and EBITDA of €20.3 million and €2.9 million, respectively, and has an enterprise value of €19.5 million, based on our due diligence in respect of the target. - On October 25, 2022, we signed the Put Option Agreement to acquire the French company ABMI, a consulting and engineering services group operating mainly in three engineering segments: (i) product design and industrialization, (ii) industrial processes and (iii) industrial facilities (e.g., nuclear and railway infrastructures). The put option may be exercised by the sellers upon completion of the information and consultation of the relevant employee representative bodies to which the offer has been submitted and we are awaiting for written confirmation of approval. The acquisition is expected to be completed in December 2022, subject to the put option being exercised by the sellers, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Following the acquisition of ABMI, we expect to combine ABMI with Abylsen in order to create a new Powerhouse, ABY Engineering. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, ABMI generated revenue and EBITDA of approximately €57.0 million and approximately €8.2 million, respectively, and has an enterprise value of approximately €60.0 million, based on our due diligence in respect of the target. ----- - On November 14, 2022, we acquired Job Raccoon in an asset deal to supplement our TIMEPARTNER Powerhouse. Job Raccoon is a German recruitment agency using an internetbased recruitment platform specializing in the recruitment of blue-collar workers. At completion, there was an upfront payment for this acquisition in an amount of €0.3 million. In addition, the purchase agreement includes an earn-out in an amount not to exceed €0.5 million in total, which may become payable if certain condition precedents are reached. Additionally, in the period under review the Group completed one material disposal: - On June 23, 2020, we entered into a share and receivable transfer agreement to sell GRITT Projects as its business model was not aligned with the Group’s overall strategy and was not delivering the expected performance. The Group, via its subsidiaries GRITT NV and LogiTechnic NV held 100% of the shares in GRITT Projects NV. The sale of GRITT Projects NV entailed (i) a capital increase done by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV of €3.2 million; (ii) the sale of the shares held by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV, against EUR 1 closing price; and (iii) the price supplement of €0.4 million. As a result, a total loss of €19.6 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020. See note 3.1 to each of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We also have a number of other potential targets in our pipeline for 2022: we have submitted one nonbinding offer, we are currently reviewing the investment memorandum for one target and we have made non-committal contact for several other targets. We have also lost out on nine potential acquisition opportunities in 2022. These offers are in line with our strategy to further invest in niche staffing, focus on digital and expand also in the engineering and consulting segment. The offers are in line with past acquisitions in terms of size and profitability. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisitions.” Our acquisitions have resulted in increased revenue and increased geographical coverage, as well as improved diversification of our services and the number of clients and end-markets that we serve. On account of the number of acquisitions that we have undertaken and intend to continue to undertake, our results of operations from period to period may not be comparable. Acquisitions, which include the acquisition of majority stakes in equity investments or joint ventures that were previously not accounted for as part of our consolidation perimeter, affect our results of operations on inclusion in our consolidation perimeter. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we accounted for Book’u as an associate; however, on May 19, 2020, we acquired a majority stake in Book’u, and as a result, a full consolidation has been recorded for Book’u in the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, as acquired businesses are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, the full impact of an acquisition is only reflected in our consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows in the subsequent financial year. Our cost of services, selling expenses and other general and administrative expenses have typically increased in proportion to the size of the acquisitions we have undertaken. Certain acquisitions, however, have created opportunities for margin improvements, particularly where such acquisitions have shifted the services mix we offer from more general to more specialized, or where such acquisitions have been in our engineering and consulting services segment, since more specialized job candidates are typically in greater demand and can thus result in our Group having greater pricing power when placing job candidates. Because of the number of acquisitions we have undertaken and the nature of the businesses we acquire, we carry a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2022, goodwill represented €1.2 billion or 49.5% of our total assets. Our goodwill is reduced by any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. If an impairment charge were made, we may record significant charges in our income statement under IFRS. For ----- example, we performed an impairment test during the second quarter of 2022 given the rising interest rate in the current market, which we consider to be an impairment indicator. Goodwill impairment in relation to the GRITT Powerhouse was identified, as the recoverable amount was €40.9 million compared to the carrying value of €54.2 million. We performed another impairment test during the third quarter of 2022 due to further increases in interest rates, and identified no additional impairments. We therefore recorded a goodwill impairment of €13.3 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2022, as we consider this change to have a long-term impact. Our margin based on current goodwill impairment tests appears to be sufficient to avoid any material impairment risk in the near future. We have historically financed acquisitions through a combination of borrowings, equity and excess cash generated within the Group. We structure our acquisitions to include, from time to time, contingent and deferred considerations that are included in the cost of the business combination at the fair value on the date of the acquisitions. Apart from a number of earn-outs for which the remaining price to be paid by us to sellers is currently estimated to be approximately €19.9 million if conditions precedent are reached, we do not have any material financial or legal claims under the stock purchase agreements for the acquisitions during the period under review. If the ABMI acquisition closes, an additional estimated earn-out of €10.0 million may become payable if certain conditions precedents are reached. In addition, under ABMI’s Put Option Agreement, we may be required to make certain payments up to an amount of approximately €5.8 million if certain events occur, such as if we receive certain credits from the French authorities. We expect to continue to pursue smaller, margin-accretive, complementary bolt-on acquisitions, which will become our Boutiques following the acquisitions, mainly in our existing markets, and we also occasionally consider larger acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our investment criteria. We will continue to focus on acquisitions of highly specialized businesses (such as IT, legal and finance), business focusing on bottleneck jobs and engineering and consulting services, as well as new geographic. We are also targeting, in particular, certain new end-markets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals and new geographic markets such as the Nordic countries and other countries, such as Austria and Switzerland.

In the first quarter of 2021, we integrated our legacy specialized staffing and general staffing segments into the current specialized talent solutions segment, and we have been presenting our results in two segments since then to reflect the integration. This change in segment reporting better reflects our strategy towards becoming further specialized in the human resources solutions market, as well as allows us to more clearly present our portfolio of services to our client base. Our financial information disclosed in this Offering Memorandum is presented under this new dual segment structure for the periods under review. Our financial information for the specialized talent solutions segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 represent the sum of the results of the legacy specialized staffing and general staffing segments.

We have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience, fluctuations in our results of operations due to seasonal demand in our current end-markets. Seasonality means that our results vary ----- from quarter to quarter, and therefore the results of one quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Seasonality varies depending on a number of different factors and can impact our two staffing segments differently. The underlying end-markets we serve are subject to various drivers that impact overall end-market demand and therefore demand from our clients for staffing. For example, the construction end-market may experience inclement weather on a worksite, which can decrease demand for our job candidates. As a result of the mix of services we provide, seasonal work can also cause peaks in demand during a specific period, such as around harvest time in the food production sector or around holiday periods, such as the Christmas holidays, Easter and summer holidays, especially for the businesses that are active in the event, hospitality and food sectors. Historically as a general matter, our revenue fluctuates, with higher levels of revenue typically generated in the second quarter of the year, then decreases during the summer holidays and increases again in the second half of the year beginning just after the summer holidays, which then lasts for a sustained period before decreasing again in December due to Christmas holidays. Due to this seasonality effect, we do not expect our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to be reflective of the results we anticipate for the full year to which they apply. The 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements were additionally impacted by Covid-19, which impacted the traditional seasonality patterns experienced by the Group with respect to revenue and working capital (with a number of governments granting postponements to certain tax or other expenses and providing grants for certain unemployment support that temporarily decreased the Group’s working capital needs) compared to previous years, though the working capital dynamics of our business are such we are largely able to match payables with receivables for job candidates at work at SMEs, which provides us with some counter cyclicality. Moreover, we also experience seasonality with regard to our working capital requirements. We generally experience larger working capital requirements in the first half of the year due to increased holiday pay, bonus pay and tax payments. While our working capital requirements are generally lower in the second half of the year, our working capital requirements also experience an increase at the end of the year for end-of year bonuses and holiday pay, particularly as certain of our businesses institute mandatory holidays at the end of the year.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.3.1,General economic conditions,"Economic and trading conditions in the countries in which we operate, or which we plan to enter, have impacted our business in the past and will likely impact our business going forward in various ways. While our business has historically generally been able to mitigate the fluctuations of the business cycle due to a flexible cost structure, economic downturns can lead to a decrease in demand for our services. Similarly, growth in national and international economies (i.e., GDP growth), particularly in the sectors in which we specialize, can lead to increased demand for our services. Among our two business segments, specialized talent solutions has historically, due to the temporary and flexible staffing element in this segment, been more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which has led to decreases in demand for such services in connection with economic downturns, but has often exhibited an early resurgence after a recession as companies often reach for this resource as they invest in the growth of their operations. Conversely, our engineering and consulting segment has historically been more “defensive,” and as a result may show the effects of economic fluctuations less intensely and may take longer after any economic downturn to recover. We have observed this same pattern in both 2020 and 2021, as the temporary and flexible staffing activities of the specialized talent segment had by the end of 2020 returned to levels comparable to, and in 2021 surpassed, those seen in 2019, as measured by weekly productive job candidates, outpacing the activity level of that for the engineering and consulting segment during the same period. For most of our Boutiques, “productive job candidates” are defined as job candidates working at the customer premises, expressed in full-time equivalents for the time they are on client assignments. The Covid-19 pandemic impacted the demand for our staffing services in 2020, and any resurgence of Covid-19 or emergence of new variants or other pandemics could lead to potential future impact. At the same time, there were a number of government initiatives introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic that positively contributed to the Group’s ability to manage cash flows. A number of these measures, however, ended in the course of 2021 or will end in the near future. Historically, following periods of crisis the Group has demonstrated an ability to rebound, in part based on its decentralized structure, allowing for flexible decision-making based on local needs and legislation, including revisions to incentive-based structures to adapt to the changing environment. Management believes that the Group’s strong geographical, segment and sector diversification has allowed it to smooth the impact and recovery across the business as demonstrated by the positive EBITDA it recorded every month throughout the Covid-19 crisis. Economic activities in our primary geographic markets normalized and recovered to pre-Covid-19 levels in 2021 and this trend was carried into 2022. Despite the outbreak of the new strain of Covid-19 virus Omicron in the last weeks of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022, we are recording a higher number of productive job candidates at work each of the weeks in 2022 to date as compared to 2019, 2020 and 2021. The outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022 has caused an immediate impact on global economic conditions, and the uncertain resolution of this conflict could result in protracted and severe damage to the global economy. Although we do not have direct economic activities in Russia and Ukraine, it is difficult to predict the scope and extent of any potential impacts the war could have on our operations, especially given we source candidates from Eastern Europe. The war has also caused supply shortage of, and therefore increased prices of, gas, energy and other raw materials, further disrupted the global supply chain, which had already been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and added to inflation, all of which are significantly impacting many companies, industries and sectors directly and indirectly, resulting in us incurring increased operating costs and our clients reconsidering ----- their recruitment efforts of domestic and foreign talents, which may, in turn, impact our results of operations. Some customers, mainly those in Germany, have ended their requests for flexible staffing solutions due to the shortage of goods or the challenges of exporting goods to Ukraine and Russia. At the same time, the labor cost inflation as a result of the overall inflation is expected to lead to higher costs of labor in relation to both our in-house employees and our people at work, which in turn will lead to an increase in the Group’s operating costs, especially in Belgium where labor cost inflation is linked to consumer price index increases. Such impact is not as significant to our specialized talent solutions segment, as the cost of people at work within this segment can be passed through almost immediately to the majority of our clients; however, this does not always apply to our engineering and consulting segment as the contracts we enter into with our clients in this segment do not typically include automatic wage pass-through provisions. Notwithstanding the above, we are generally able to pass through the increased costs due to labor shortage and inflation to our clients. In addition to these general trends, our results of operations have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by certain other key macroeconomic conditions, such as the changing demographic mix as the number of people retiring outpaces the number of people entering the labor force, unemployment rates and staffing penetration, in the geographic markets in which we operate. Low unemployment rates often indicate a shortage of available workers in an economy, which can increase the demand for our job candidates, whom we often recruit from other countries and increasingly through our digital initiatives in an effort to establish a steady inflow. Furthermore, increases in staffing penetration can indicate a greater prevalence or acceptance of temporary staffing in an economy, which increases the market for our services. We generally operate in geographic markets that are characterized by high average salaries, low unemployment and which are well developed and mature in the temporary staffing and consulting fields. As a result of these trends, the demand for our services has increased significantly over the last decade. For further information relating to the outlook for the staffing solutions industry in our main geographical markets, see “Industry and Market Data.” Macroeconomic trends within each of our primary markets also contribute to the performance of our operations in each of these countries: _Belgium_ Data from the European Commission shows that annual real GDP growth in Belgium was 2.1%, (5.7)% and 6.2% in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Belgium has also continued to experience a tightening in the labor market as the population ages and there are fewer local workers to take the place of retirees. Furthermore, Belgium has also been experiencing high employment rates due to employment outgrowing the active population. Unemployment in Belgium has gone from 7.5% in 2007 to 6.4% in 2021, according to data from the World Bank. Staffing penetration has also increased in response to this tightening of the labor market and decrease in unemployment. In the near term, while growth saturation of employment will likely slow our growth in Belgium in the private sector, the opening of certain public sector opportunities may offset this slowdown to a certain degree. Management believes that the impact of potential client default is limited. As an illustration, the historical rate of insolvencies (as a percentage of company stock) in Belgium from 2007 to 2016, based on third party market data, has ranged between 0.5% to a maximum of 2.2% for small and medium sized firms and below 0.5% for larger firms with over 250 employees, including during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Accordingly, bad debt provisions as a percentage of sales in Accent have ranged steadily between 0% to 0.3% of sales, on an LTM basis, from 2017 through September 30, 2022. _The Netherlands_ Data from the European Commission shows that annual real GDP growth was 2.0%, (3.8)% and 5.0% in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively, in the Netherlands. As is the case elsewhere, GDP growth in the ----- Netherlands affects us primarily through its effect on the end-markets in which our clients operate. Our engineering and consulting and specialized staffing segments in the Netherlands are affected by growth in the construction and engineering markets, which in turn are driven by overall domestic economic growth. Long-term demographic and economic trends are also driving a demand for construction workers. After a downturn from 2009 until 2012, the Dutch construction end-market has been growing significantly due in part to general economic resurgence, low interest rates, as well an increase in environmentally-focused project or larger infrastructure projects. These trends contribute to demand for job candidates with specialties and skills that operate in the construction end-market. The Netherlands also has a number of jobs that are driven by regulatory developments in addition to GDP fluctuations. For example, demand for job candidates in the financial services sector is impacted by the growth in financial regulation. This impacts demand for our services, due to the fact that, within our engineering and consulting segment, our Powerhouse Redmore provides job candidates with technical, specialized skills to the financial sector. This also happens in the public and government sector, an end-market that our Powerhouse Cohedron addresses. The Netherlands, similarly to Belgium, has historically had low unemployment rates which impacts our business positively. Between 2007 and 2014, the unemployment rate in the Netherlands rose from 4.2% to 7.4%, but then decreased to 4.0% in 2021 (according to data from the World Bank). This low unemployment rate has led to fewer local individuals going into the strenuous working conditions of the logistics workforce, which has supported demand for our job candidates, including our foreign job candidates, who have experience in this sector and can meet demand for such jobs. _Germany_ Data from the European Commission shows that annual real GDP growth in Germany was 1.1%, (4.6)% and 2.9% in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In Germany, our general staffing activity is GDPsensitive and exposes us more directly to fluctuations in GDP and economic change. As GDP slows, market value grows at a slower pace and the number of hours worked by an individual decreases. Lowskilled, mainly blue-collar workers are, however, in structural shortage in Germany, which provides opportunities for our services. Unemployment in Germany between 2007 and 2021 fell from 8.7% to 3.5% (according to data from the World Bank). Companies are, therefore, expected to continue to address staff shortages through temporary staffing. Moreover, we believe that generally lower-skilled workers do not travel as much, which can lead to significantly localized shortages in demand. Some companies, including ours, overcome this barrier through sourcing in Eastern Europe where lower skilled workers are willing to travel. Decreasing unemployment and shortages of low-skilled blue-collar workers has driven an increased reliance on temp workers leading to an increase in demand for our services. Finally, the staffing industry specifically was impacted by certain German regulatory reforms, including the Act on Staffing (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz) (“AÜG”), which has been substantially amended over the years, most recently in 2017. The focus of the 2017 amendment was to strengthen permanent employment; as a result, a maximum period for temporary staffing has been introduced and formal requirements have been tightened up as has the equal pay principle. Providing staffing services in the construction industry in Germany is also generally prohibited by law, although it is possible for a staffing solutions provider who is active in the construction industry to obtain a specific permit. Additionally, beginning in 2021 the German government has generally forbidden staffing companies to work in the meat industry as a result of the sanitary crisis in 2020. See “—Changes in regulation— _Temporary Employment Regulations.” France_ Data from the European Commission shows that annual real GDP growth in France was 1.8%, (7.9)% and 7.0% in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In France, we only provide engineering consulting ----- under our engineering and consulting segment, which has historically been insulated to a significant degree from GDP fluctuations. The unemployment rate in France has increased from 7.7% to 8.1% between 2007 and 2021 (according to data from the World Bank), which is higher than the other countries in which we work. As we operate in a specialized sector in France, the structurally high unemployment in France, however, has not impacted demand for our services in a material manner, nor do we expect it to do so in the future. _Brexit_ On January 1, 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement entered into force provisionally and entered into force on May 1, 2021. Despite the implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how the agreement will affect relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially in practice from the terms before withdrawal. Lack of clarity about future laws and regulations in the United Kingdom as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. The economic outlook could be further adversely affected by: (i) the risk arising from changes in laws and regulations in the U.K.; (ii) the risk that movements in the pound sterling exchange rates related to Brexit could damage competitiveness or profitability; (iii) the risk that goods moving between the U.K. and any member of the EU will be subject to duties and tariffs; and (iv) the risk that goods moving between the U.K. and any member of the EU will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. As the U.K. represents a key export market for several of the countries in which we operate, particularly Belgium and the Netherlands, adverse trade terms between the U.K. and the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on the economies of these countries, which could by extension adversely affect our business. Furthermore, Brexit has limited the ability of individuals from various foreign countries to work in the U.K., which increased the supply of job candidates in several of the countries in which we operate, but we believe that this trend has not significantly impacted our Gross Margin. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our results of operations could be _materially adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.3.2,Changes in regulation,"While the markets in which we operate tend to be fairly stable from a legal and regulatory perspective, from time to time there are changes that may impact the performance of our business. Our industry is extensively regulated by regulatory authorities in each of the countries in which we operate and at an EU level. These regulations impact how we structure our employment agreements with job candidates and our service agreements with clients. See “Regulation.” During the period under review, certain changes in the regulatory frameworks, particularly the new legislations on payroll that took effect in the Netherlands from January 1, 2020 which, among other things, mandated that payroll employees are entitled to all terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions, impacted our results of operations. _Temporary Employment Regulation_ Regulations around temporary employment can impact the clients and opportunities that are available to us. For example, as from the 2017 to 2018 period, the Belgian region of Flanders and the Belgian federal government authorized temporary employment in the public sector for periods of up to twelve months, which has provided additional opportunities to place temporary employees within these sectors. While this practice is still not permitted in the Belgian region of Wallonia, if in the future and to the ----- extent that this region adopts a similar policy, it could further increase our ability to provide our services in that region. Moreover, regulations can affect the duration of our services. In Germany, since the last reform of the AÜG in April 2017, the assignment period of temporary workers was limited to 18 months (with exceptions) after which the employee either needs to be let go from the company where they were working or accepted on to the general payroll of that company. As a result, as our job candidates approach the end of their assignment period they will either need to be replaced, which can be difficult during times of scarcity of qualified job candidates, or are taken over by the client resulting in lower volumes for us. Furthermore, wages and benefits of temporary workers are aligned to those of the employees of the company after nine months of uninterrupted assignment (through the “EqualPay” mechanism), but must be paid by the staffing solutions provider, which increases the administrative burden on us. In addition, beginning in 2021 the German government has generally forbidden staffing companies to work in the meat industry as a result of the sanitary crisis in 2020. In the Netherlands, there have been low-wage benefits regulations (“LIV”) which create subsidies for the employment of low-wage workers since January 2017. This law is aimed at incentivizing employers to hire employees who have a vulnerable position in the labor market. A review of these incentives, however, resulted in cuts to the maximum compensation to the normal LIV in 2020, which resulted in lower subsidies obtained in 2020 as compared to prior years, especially in Covebo, despite comparable turnover. In November 2022, this law was further revised and it was decided that, only for 2022, the LIV benefit for 2022 will be increased retroactively, while the LIV benefit for 2023 will be remain at the normal level and the LIV benefit for 2024 will be reduced. If the planned pension reform goes ahead in 2025, the LIV will end in 2024. Moreover, under the Wet Aanpak Schijnconstructies (“WAS”) regulation, cost related to workers, can be withheld from workers’ wages only if the wage remains above net minimum wage (since January 2016). However, deductions are still allowed below minimum wage for pension and healthcare insurance. All other deductions are not allowed if the net salary then becomes below minimum wage. For these non-deducted costs, we send invoices to the workers. If workers do not pay their invoices and return to their country of origin, we are left with the costs. This regulation has no impact for the clients. Significant Dutch law changes came into effect with respect to temporary agency work and payrolling, among others. From January 1, 2020, the Balanced Labor Market Act (Wet Arbeidsmarkt in balans) (“WAB”) came into effect. For example, there will be increased social security charges for temporary staffing agencies in their capacity as employer. Furthermore, payroll employees will be entitled to all terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions. These regulations came into effect in 2020 and our cost of services has increased, but simultaneously also our sales prices increased. We currently see that we have been able to pass on the majority of these increases in costs to our clients through higher fees charged for our services. Furthermore, new legislation has come into effect requiring employment housing to remain available for four weeks following the end of employment of foreign workers. Currently, the majority of foreign workers leave employment housing immediately following the end of their employment, or during the weekend thereafter. Foreign workers that do remain in employment housing are required to pay weekly rent, and we send them weekly invoices. There is increasing attention in the Netherlands on separation between employment providers and housing providers. While this separation is not currently legally required, our Covebo Powerhouse has already implemented relevant measures to address it. We expect a contractual separation will be enforced in the future; however, there is currently no clear indication as to the extent of what the required separation will be, and we cannot be certain at this time whether a complete separation, or a full ban on the provision of housing to temporary workers by employment agencies, will be legally required in the future. For a further discussion of the regulatory framework in which we conduct our business in our principal geographic end-markets, see “Regulation.” ----- _Tax Regulation_ Changes in tax law can impact our current and future tax liabilities, and can also lead to reversals of certain deferred tax income balances. For example, the Belgian Corporate Income Tax regime has been modified by the Belgian Government by means of the Corporate Income Tax Reform Act of December 25, 2017 (Official Gazette of December 29, 2017). As a result of the reform, we remeasured our deferred income tax balances. Deferred income tax expected to be reversed in the year to December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 has been measured using the effective rate that will apply in Belgium for the period (29.58%). Deferred income tax expected to be reversed beyond December 31, 2021 has been measured with an effective rate of 25%. Further, the Dutch corporate income tax rates and brackets have been modified. As of January 1, 2022, the Netherlands levies Dutch corporate income tax at a rate of 15% with respect to taxable profits up to €395,000 and 25.8% with respect to taxable profits in excess of that amount. _Financial regulation_ While regulations on banking, insurance and the financial industry as a whole only have an indirect material effect on our business, recent regulatory developments in the financial industry between 2016 and 2019, including the updates to the financial supervision amendment Act, the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products regulation, the Capital Markets Union, the International Financial Reporting Standards, final documents on the Reform of Basel III (“Basel IV”), Customer DD/Know your Customer regulations, the Uniform Calculation Method-Uniform pension calculation, and the new EU Directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (“IORP II”), have created a heightened need for specialized employees, which can create additional demand for our job candidates who focus on compliance and legal matters in the financial industry. _ESG Regulation_ On April 21, 2021, the European Commission adopted a proposal for the CSRD, which would amend the existing reporting requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and encourage corporate spending towards sustainable activities across the EU. The European Council approved the CSRD on November 28, 2022 and the application of the regulation is expected to take place in four stages, the first of which will require companies that already fall under the CSRD to complete their first CSRD reporting on the financial year 2024, with expected reporting deadlines in 2025. We expect that we will be required to comply with the CSRD. We cannot guarantee how the CSRD will impact our governance structure and our day-to-day business activities. We have a formalized ESG charter to guide us on achieving our targeted ESG KPIs and complying with relevant ESG regulations. See “Business— _Environmental, Social and Governance” for information on our ESG initiatives._",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.3.3,Drivers of sales and pricing,"_Organic Growth_ In addition to the sales growth created through the acquisitions discussed above (see “—Factors _Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Acquisitions, Disposals and the Comparability of our Financial Statements”), our sales are impacted by the Organic Growth of our_ business. We measure Organic Growth by analyzing revenue growth between one financial period and the comparable prior period, excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue as follows: - in respect of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (compared against the nine months ended September 30, 2021), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2021; ----- - in respect of revenue for 2021 (compared against 2020), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2020; and - in respect of revenue for 2020 (compared against 2019), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019 or that divestments have taken place as of January 1, 2019. The key drivers of the Organic Growth of our business are: - increasing our geographic footprint by opening new branches with our “cell division” approach; - continuing our growth in stronghold sectors and niches; - winning new contracts with clients; - expanding our work with existing clients; - sourcing additional job candidates that can fill scarce assignments held by our clients; - increasing candidate sourcing through international recruitment; - digitalization; - expanding into new business lines; and - pricing growth. We seek to minimize the financial risk of new offices by focusing on securing new sales in a geographic region before committing to additional costs of a new office there. Historically, we have successfully hired additional sales employees onto our payroll to win new contracts with clients; our Powerhouse Continu Professionals has notably employed this approach successfully. Furthermore, our business integration in Germany and the expansion of our business through the opening of new branches of our existing Powerhouses in 2022 have accelerated our Organic Growth. When doing bolt-on acquisitions in new but matching sectors, we have successfully expanded these services to existing branches, as proven by Continu Professionals with the acquisition of mténv. Moreover, our Organic Growth is impacted by our ability to improve the utilization of job candidates and reduce our bench time, see “—Gross Margin—Bench time/Utilization,” increasing our sales in time and material contracts over any given period. Our ability to expand our business geographically by opening offices in new locations also functions as an incentive to reward employees who have demonstrated strong results and initiative and would be well-suited to lead new offices. We typically open new offices when we receive a significant number of requests from existing clients or prospective clients to provide services in new locations or when we see increasing demand for our services coming from a specific region. Expansion through opening new offices has positively impacted and is expected to continue to impact our operating profits. _Staffing volume_ The key drivers of staffing volume in any given market are the macro-economic and sector specific growth, and the labor tightness, see “—General economic conditions” discussed above and the regulatory environment, see “—Changes in regulation” above.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.3.4,Pricing,"----- The substantial majority of our service agreements are structured to give us the ability to pass-through wage increases from inflation to customers in both of our segments. See “Business—Our Strengths— _Ability to pass through wage increases to customers, including through automatic contractual mechanisms, and stable margins.”_ In the specialized talent solutions segment, which accounted for 46.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, price increases are automatically passed through to our clients. For this segment, our contract model is centered on matching the length of our candidate’s employment contract with us to the length of our placement contract with our client, the ultimate employer, in order to limit bench time risk and prevent lag time between inflation of gross salary paid to the candidate and the cost we charge to our clients, which results in an automatic pass-through of any salary increases. Under these types of contracts, the utilization risk of the job candidates in between contracts is reduced. In Germany, temporary workers are, however, required to be on the temporary employment company’s payroll, which creates bench time risk for us with regard to our temporary job candidates in our specialized talent solutions segment. In many cases, bench time is limited, as temporary workers’ contracts can usually be terminated in, on average, two weeks’ notice given during the time of the job candidate’s last assignment, unless we decide to retain them. At the end of our contracts, we renegotiate them, which has historically resulted in an ability to increase our prices in line with wage inflation. Our revenues typically correlate with nominal GDP rather than real GDP due to our stables margins and ability to pass through wage increases in an inflationary environment. We base our contract pricing on a candidate’s gross salary multiplied by a coefficient factor, with the split typically being transparent to the client. The key pricing drivers for the coefficient factor are the scarcity of candidates and the value of any additional services we offer. Key costs for us include salaries and work accident insurance. At the end of the contract period, typically one week or one month in length, if the salary increases, then we charge the cost of the higher salary to the client. In the specialized talent solutions segment, regulations in Belgium and the Netherlands require that job candidates through our services are paid the same as local or company-sourced workers, while this applies in Germany only after a job candidate has worked for the employer for a certain period of time. The following chart illustrates our revenue per billed hour for the specialized talent solutions segment. Source: Company information, external consultant analysis. Price analysis excludes TMI. In our engineering and consulting segment, which accounted for 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with clients. The contracts are typically time and material contracts, which means we are compensated for the time that our job candidates spend with a client on assignment, and have no obligations for any specific result. Most of our candidates in our engineering and consulting segment are permanently hired by us on employment contracts that typically have three- to six-week notice periods and we have placement contracts with our clients that typically last nine to twelve months, which allows us to effectively manage bench time and match our candidates with the upcoming mandates from clients. In most cases, we plan for salary increases in advance and negotiate rate increases with our clients accordingly. Our pricing model in our engineering and consulting segment centers on charging the client an hourly or ----- daily rate. Our billing rate is typically based on an hourly wage and a mark-up where the split is usually not transparent to clients. Key drivers of the hourly or daily rates are skills, seniority and scarcity of candidates. Our key costs include salary, potentially including a company car. At the end of a placement contract, renewal either entails replacing the candidate with a new or more junior person at a new price or by placing the same candidate, at a more senior level with a higher salary. Margin growth in our engineering and consulting segment is driven by increasing the cost per hour paid and billed. The hourly and daily pricing model for engineering and consulting positions generally produces higher Gross Margins than factor pricing based on the job candidates’ gross salaries. In our engineering and consulting segment, there is a higher risk of bench time than in our specialized talent solutions segment, as a result of our job candidates being on our payroll but not being used on a paid job assignment. As their employer, we are still responsible for their costs even if they are not generating money for our operations. To mitigate the bench time risk, we carefully monitor our job candidates that are our employees with indefinite term contracts and seek to minimize their bench time by lining up assignments to transition to once a current one is complete, or by terminating employment agreements as appropriate should transition to another assignment be not feasible or desirable. The following chart illustrates our revenue per billed hour for the engineering and consulting segment. Source: Company information, external consultant analysis. Price analysis excludes Cohedron. We also perform a limited amount of work under search and selection contracts in both of our business segments through our Accent (through the Ctrl-F brand), Redmore (through the Ctrl-F brand), TIMEPARTNER, Continu Professionals, Covebo, GRITT and TMI Powerhouses. This can be done either by the Powerhouses themselves or through one of their Boutiques. Unlike for other types of contracts, the full amount of the commissions typically remains with us as it is not subject to cost of services or other deductions. In such arrangements, we do not benefit from a share of the on-going revenue during the duration of the employment as we do in other contracts. We also perform certain amount of work placing freelancers. In the case of freelancers, rather than receiving a salary from us, the freelancers submit invoices to us for the services they have provided to the relevant client. Freelancers produce smaller Gross Margins for us as they are generally more experienced and are therefore more expensive to hire, but this is partially compensated by the fact that freelancers present no bench risk for us.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.3.5,Competition,"Our results of operations are impacted by the levels of competition that we experience in each of the markets in which we operate and in any new markets that we may enter. We compete with other firms offering HR solutions to both clients and job candidates to varying degrees in each of the geographical markets and staffing segments in which we operate. Competition for both of these groups is based on a variety of factors, and such competition has intensified following the Covid-19 pandemic due to the general labor shortage. Competitive factors in obtaining and retaining clients can include the ability to find job candidates with the appropriate skills and/or experience, brand awareness, quality, speed of client service, proximity to the client and particularly in relation to temporary staffing services, and price. Competitive factors in obtaining and retaining job candidates can include wages, quality of engagement, number of hours of work available, responsiveness to work schedules, job content and type of project, personal validation of the job candidates and brand image. ----- On large contracts, which are more common in temporary staffing services under our specialized talent solutions segment, there is often pressure on pricing due to the increased competitiveness in the industry. There is often less pricing pressure in our engineering and consulting segment, due to the scarcity of candidates to fill certain roles. As a result, this segment and the higher margins associated with these fields are becoming increasingly attractive to firms in the industry. In certain of our key geographic markets, such as the Netherlands, the specialized HR solutions market is relatively mature with comparatively established pricing. Across all four of our key geographic markets the industry is fragmented. In individual markets and specialist sectors, we compete with smaller, more localized or more specialized firms. As a result of the trend towards consolidation in the specialized HR solutions industry, we also compete with larger full-service and specialized competitors in the international, national, regional and local markets. In addition, some current and prospective clients, particularly among larger corporates, may elect not to fill their staffing requirements from outside sources, and may instead hire independent contractors directly on a temporary basis or provide similar services internally. Many clients use more than one staffing services provider, and the majority of client relationships are non-exclusive. Websites, search engines and online job boards, such as Google for Jobs, monsterboard.nl and Indeed are improving their matching capabilities, potentially affecting part of our business. Pricing, promotional and marketing actions of our competitors may also impact our business, such that our price levels could be impacted or that we need to invest more in marketing and advertising to obtain the right candidates.

(118.2) 6.8% (116.4) 7.3% (112.9) 5.5% (81.8) 5.6% (126.1) 6.2% _Cost of Services_ Cost of services comprises costs directly attributable to revenue, which mainly relate to costs associated with our job candidates, such as their wages and salaries, social security charges, training costs, other benefits (including housing expenses, car leases, mobility costs, vouchers for meals and other incentives, such as reimbursements to job candidates for utilizing environmentally friendly transportation solutions as well as other benefits for job candidates), and costs associated with freelancers. A small portion of these costs relates to material costs for projects performed in GRITT Projects, which was divested in 2020. Our job candidates’ wages and salaries, social security and other benefits amounted to our largest cost of services during the period under review. The principal factor that affects these costs is the number of job candidates that we employ. As a result, these costs increase ----- as we add additional job candidates either through growing our business organically or through acquisitions. Our overall number of job candidates, however, may not be representative of our expected cost of services since these costs will be impacted by the level of compensation each job candidate receives, which is in turn linked to inflation, specializations, qualifications and positions filled by each job candidate. During the period of Covid-19, which had a particularly severe impact on the global economy in 2020, attracting foreign nationals entailed additional costs, given restrictions on crossing borders and additional quarantine measures and isolation requirements which led to increased numbers of days of unproductivity, with the result of increased housing expenses, hygienic and sanitary costs and provision of groceries for candidates arriving from abroad. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cost of services decreased by 7.8%, from €1,288.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,188.2 million. This was in parallel with an 8.2% decrease in revenue during the same period, from €1,738.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,596.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This illustrates the largely variable nature of our cost base, as Accent, Continu Professionals and Covebo mainly employ workers whose contracts can be terminated immediately, or who can be put on the bench without cost, as well as freelancers. For workers with less flexible conditions, typically because they are on our payroll with an indefinite term contract, such as the specialists employed by GRITT, Abylsen and TIMEPARTNER (including AERO and IBB) under permanent contracts and whose costs of services are therefore semi-variable, we were able to rely on economic unemployment measures to decrease the related costs. In some cases, even when companies could terminate contracts immediately, they chose not to do so and instead opted to rely on certain government economic unemployment initiatives so they could scale up quickly when the Covid-19 restrictive measures eased. These companies also employ freelancers, for whom costs are fully variable. Such additional costs reduced in 2021 as lockdown measures eased, which consequentially also led to a higher level of staffing activities compared to 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our cost of services increased by 26.6%, from €1,188.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €1,504.3 million. This was in parallel with a 28.4% increase in revenue during the same period, from €1,596.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €2,050.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Given the nature of our operations, which typically results in us placing our job candidates on our payroll while they are on assignment, we are required to insure a significant number of persons against work accidents, which impacts our cost of services. Since 2021, a variable premium rate has been applied to our work accident insurance, with a base premium rate of 2.918%, a mid-case rate of 3.064% and worst-case rate of 3.097%, depending on the number of work accidents we have. This premium is calculated based on the gross salary mass of our temporary workers. Such cost will be partly offset by customer compensations and efforts to lower accident occurrence and further offset by other cost reductions, following efficiencies realized in other departmental costs within Accent. Ransomware and other cyber risks have increased in general during Covid-19 and also require us to invest in a higher standard of back-up procedures as work from home and remote working practices predominate, especially in relation to compliance with data protection laws, avoidance of misappropriation and cyber theft, leading to higher operating costs for our information technologies, as additional work, licenses and expertise is needed to detect and prevent adverse occurrences. This also increased our cost of services since 2020. _Gross Margin_ Our Gross Margin represents our gross profit (our revenue less our cost of services) divided by our revenue. Our Gross Margin was 25.9%, 25.6% and 26.6% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and 26.0% and 26.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. There are two primary drivers of our Gross Margin: the bill-pay spread and the bench time/utilization of our job candidates (particularly our job candidates in our engineering and consulting segment): ----- - _Bill-pay spread: We will typically enter into an employment agreement with the job candidate (often for the duration of an assignment or longer in the case of certain business units) and we will enter into a placement contract or project contract with the client. We then bill the client for the services performed by the job candidate who are on time and material contracts and pay the salary of the job candidate. The percentage difference between what we bill our clients and what we pay as salary to the job candidates is referred to as the “bill-pay spread” and it is the key driver of our profitability. - _Bench time/Utilization: Job candidates in most of our engineering and consulting business units as well as our job candidates in Germany are our permanent employees on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. As a result, our engineering and consulting segment in particular carefully monitors the end date of all job candidates’ assignments and aims to line up the next assignment before their current ones come to an end. This monitoring seeks to minimize “bench time,” which is the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a client assignment. Our bench time for 2021 was approximately 0.3%. By minimizing a job candidate’s bench time, we aim to ensure the job candidate is being utilized on a project that requires his or her skill set, so there is a match between what we bill the client for the job candidate’s services and what we pay the job candidate. New assignments also ensure future career development of the job candidate. Furthermore, the impact of utilization upon our Gross Margin will also depend on the mix of job candidates whose utilization is impacted, with the more specialized job candidates typically performing work under contracts with higher bill-pay spreads as a result of their scarcity and specialization. As most of our contracts are on a time and materials basis, increased utilization rates will typically improve our Gross Margin. The Covid-19 pandemic has presented an additional impact on our Gross Margin as a result of various local government measures providing partial compensation for temporary unemployment, such as furlough schemes. In certain cases, for example in France, we retained job candidates on our payroll but the government measures did not provide full compensation for such candidates; therefore, the company responsible for the candidate still had to pay a portion of the compensation. In addition, in certain cases we also retained job candidates on our payroll in order to accommodate our customers more quickly when the isolation measures were over, without having to wait for additional hires. For some companies that typically have higher bench time, we saw a reduction in their bench time as a result of placing job candidates on government economic unemployment initiatives. Due to the difference in Gross Margin between our various segments, our segment mix, and within each segment, our industry, sector or candidate mix can affect our overall Gross Margin. For example, in Accent, the construction end-market generates a higher Gross Margin than the hospitality end-market, and student candidates generate a lower Gross Margin compared to the experienced candidates. Below is the revenue split between our two business segments for the years ending December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by 8.2%, from €1,738.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,596.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of Covid-19. In response to this unprecedented situation, we modified certain of our operational practices and changed how we communicate both internally and with customers; we implemented additional protective procedures; and we accessed temporary government measures that were advantageous to us. ----- In respect of sales in our markets, our response included keeping branches open to the extent possible, such that the large majority of our branch network continues to exist post-lockdowns, as management sought to preserve stability in terms of access to customers. Temporary Unemployment measures were utilized in order to retain experienced and trained staff members, while we undertook various initiatives and loyalty programs for staff of platforms and operating companies, including motivational training. We also awarded special bonuses in respect of extraordinary efforts with new customers, and for boosting sales in the initial months after the first lock-down. In particular, in Accent, special regional growth bonuses, which were structured to allow for increased collaboration on a region-wide basis, and speed bonuses, for those offices that were the first to return to financial performance in line with 2019 figures, were awarded. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we managed our costs of services, where possible, by placing consultants or temporary workers on temporary unemployment or similar schemes (depending on available government assistance in each of our markets) in order to keep our workforce intact to the extent possible, so as to be able to place these candidates back on customer assignment once customers resumed hiring. In Continu Professionals, consultants were also kept on the payroll, and were kept on the bench so as to allow them to return to work after the virus’s first wave. This approach paid off during the summer, when the large majority of people on the bench were back at work with a customer. We also reduced expenses by placing internal staff on temporary unemployment where we deemed appropriate, such as in branches that were inactive because the sector had closed (such as the retail nonfood and hotel, retail and café (“horeca”) segments). In Accent, we placed internal staff on temporary unemployment on March 18, 2020, the first day this was allowed by the authorities. In Abylsen, internal staff were not put on temporary unemployment, thereby permitting them to remain close to those consultants that were still at the customer, allowing us to continue to detect further opportunities with those customers that were still active during the first lock-down. We reduced marketing expenses and other expenses to the minimum required in 2020, while retooling in an effort to draw interest, such as webinars we organized for customers to explain the impact of government measures. Management also reduced capital expenditures compared to recent prior years in order to protect cash levels during the Covid-19 pandemic and as a precautionary measure also drew on its Existing Revolving Credit Facility in March 2020, which was subsequently repaid in June 2020. Our sales fully recovered during 2021, achieving above pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels, mostly due to the economic recovery and the overall digitalization trends that are expected to continue going forward. With global economy having been revived in 2021, there is a talent crunch as companies are looking to fill positions that were cut in 2020 due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, the Covid19 pandemic has led to many job candidates re-evaluating their careers, work conditions and long-term professional goals, resulting in an increased rate of employees switching jobs and transitioning between different job modes. This has led employers to focus more intensely than ever on employee retention and job mobility, which has created substantial opportunities for us to offer our services. In response to the evolving market trends, we are increasingly more focused on the bottleneck professions and specialized jobs, and our M&A strategy is strengthening our capability to capitalize on such trends. For example, our acquisitions of TMI and Cohedron helped us to expand and compete in the healthcare and public sectors. Also, Accent partnered with a regional public employment service, the VDAB (the Flemish Institution for Employment Mediation and Training), to participate in CareerFlow, a government-initiated project in Belgium that facilitates job mobility between employers and provides alternatives to employees. Through this project, employees can temporarily or permanently work for different employers, which allows them to develop skill sets that would best match their professional goals. This creates a benefit for both employers and job candidates, as employers have a larger and more diverse talent pool to tap into for their various staffing needs, while job candidates have a better chance to stay employed and more flexibility in shaping their careers. ----- Although the spread of the new strain of Covid-19, Omicron, in the last weeks of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022 did not visibly impact our recovery in terms of sales, increased sickness and isolation measures did put pressure on our Gross Margin. Furthermore, we are navigating a new market landscape as the expectations and preferences of employers and job candidates have changed drastically during the Covid-19 pandemic. There is no clear indication whether there will be an ongoing resurgence in the spread of Covid-19 in our primary markets in the future, and together with the war in Ukraine, we are experiencing increased costs of labor, services and raw materials as a result of inflation and are facing the prospect of another recession. We generally have the ability to, however, pass through wage increases from inflation to customers in both our engineering and consulting segment and our specialized talent solutions segment, which, coupled with our flexible cost structure, has resulted in resilient Gross Margins. Our revenues typically correlate with nominal GDP rather than real GDP due to our stable margins and ability to pass through wage increases in an inflationary environment.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

(1) Excludes the corporate segment and intragroup eliminations, which amounted to less than 1%. ----- Additionally, the difference in Gross Margin between various types of contracts can also affect our overall Gross Margin. For example, our search and selection services are based on commissions earned for job candidates sourced for clients. We receive less revenue from such services because we only locate the candidate and then receive a search and selection commission, rather than a contract with the client that also includes such job candidate’s wages or salary, social security and other benefits to be paid out and administered by us. Such contracts tend to provide a higher Gross Margin of approximately 100% since there are no subsequent costs to deduct from the commissions received. _Selling Expenses_ Selling expenses comprise the wages and salaries (including variable pay), social security charges and other benefits (such as accommodation expenses) for in-house employees responsible for operational activities at our branches, as well as advertising and marketing (including internal marketing), amortization of customer relationships and brand names that were originally valued in the context of various business combinations and other selling expenses. Selling expenses are primarily impacted by the number of in-house employees we employ. As a result, selling expenses will increase when we grow our operations and the number of in-house employees that we have who manage the recruiting lifecycle and oversee the sourcing, selection and placement of our job candidates on assignment. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic also resulted in an increase in such selling expenses. In particular, in Accent we paid a one-time additional bonus to members of our commercial team during the second and third quarters of 2020, in recognition of extraordinary continuing contributions during the Covid-19 period. As the impact of Covid-19 lessened in 2021, selling expenses increased primarily in correspondence with revenue. _Other general and administrative expenses_ Other general and administrative expenses comprise personnel and accommodation expenses of head offices, IT expenses, depreciation expenses largely relating to charges on capitalized buildings, cars and software, and other general and administrative expenses at the headquarters level, as well as share-based payments. During the period under review, our share-based payments consisted of several ratchet schemes offered to key management at different acquired Powerhouses (Abylsen, Covebo, Continu Professional, TIMEPARTNER and GRITT) (“ratchet schemes”) and our former long-term incentive plan at the level of shareholders of House of HR (“long-term incentive plan”), which we settled in connection with the Acquisition. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, we recognized €4.6 million, €3.9 million and €1.5 million, respectively, in share-based payments connected to option grants made under our longterm incentive plan launched in 2018. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized €3.7 million in share-based payments connected to option grants made under the same long-term incentive plan. See note 19 to each of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 21 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On the Acquisition Closing Date, we established the structure for a management equity participation program pursuant to which certain managers of the Group are able to acquire, subscribe for or otherwise receive MIP Securities.

At the same time, clients expect more efficient services at a lower cost that can only be delivered through the use of digital tools. We have also seen an increase in the number of passive job seekers who apply through targeted advertisements on social media when they were not actively searching for a position at the time. The market has also experienced the development of new platforms, such as Uber Works in the United States, which however announced in May 2020 the closure of their operations in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to their official press release. Such platforms may be considered competitors, since they sometimes are able to attract people directly to be employed for them via freelance or independent status. Nevertheless, such platforms lack a human touch in the services they provide, and authorities in different countries monitor fair treatment of workers by these platforms and are looking to ensure that there is no unfair competition with other forms of labor.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws that are enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date in the countries where we operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in our tax returns with regard to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the relevant tax authority. _Deferred tax_ ----- Deferred tax is recognized in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities are, however, not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax primarily arises from the valuation of customer relationships and brand names and the allocation of amortization on them, as well as from fair value adjustments relating to the then existing senior facilities.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

This decrease was primarily the result of the decrease in demand for highly skilled professionals across sectors as recruitment came to a halt during the Covid19 pandemic, which led to less consultants on our payroll primarily in Abylsen, GRITT and Continu Professionals. This was partially offset by the increased employment in Redmore, as the banking and insurance sectors were relatively less affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the increased chargeability due to higher utilization as a result of remote working arrangements, which resulted in a reduction of sick leave. _Specialized talent solutions_ ----- Revenue for the specialized talent solutions segment (excluding the corporate segment and intragroup eliminations) decreased by 8.3%, from €1,175.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,078.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily the result of businesses closing down in our primary markets, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, due to the restrictive measures that governments imposed in response to Covid-19, which reduced recruitment needs for the sectors on which the specialized talent solutions segment predominantly focuses. Accent and NOWJOBS were particularly severely impacted, as all of Accent’s branches were closed by the end of March 2020 as a precautionary measure and due to NOWJOBS’s exposure to the leisure and horeca sectors. Foreign job candidates were also more reluctant to relocate during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. _Revenue by geographical location_ The following table sets out our revenue split by geographical location for the periods indicated. Revenue from our operations in Belgium decreased from €672.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €552.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to decreased demand in our services by our clients as staffing needs declined due to the economic impact of Covid-19. Revenue from our operations in the Netherlands increased from €548.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €588.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased employment in Redmore, as the banking and insurance sectors were relatively less affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the increased chargeability due to higher utilization as a result of remote working arrangements and the resulting reduction of sick leave. Revenue from our operations in Germany decreased from €392.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €336.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to decreased demand in our services by our clients as staffing needs reduced due to the economic impact of Covid-19. Revenue from our operations in France decreased from €109.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €103.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to decreased demand in our services by our clients as staffing needs reduced due to the economic impact of Covid-19.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.42,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.42.1,Overview,"Our principal cash requirements consist of investments in acquisitions, capital expenditures, servicing financial indebtedness, payroll costs and paying taxes. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and financing cash flows from drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility, availability under the Delayed Draw Term Facility and committed and uncommitted lines. The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain conditions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” Our ability to generate operating cash flows depends on operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” We believe that, based on our current level of operations as reflected in its results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and committed and uncommitted lines will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures and to debt service for at least the next twelve months. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us may be restricted by, among other things, the amount of distributable reserves and legal prohibitions on such payments or otherwise distributing funds to us, including for the purpose of servicing debt. Losses or other events could further reduce the net equity and distributable reserves of our subsidiaries. In 2020 and 2021, we undertook a number of measures to preserve our liquidity during the Covid-19 pandemic, including managing our costs of services, where possible, by placing consultants or temporary workers on temporary unemployment or similar schemes (depending on available government assistance in each of our markets) in order to keep our workforce intact to the extent possible, so as to be able to place these candidates back on customer assignment once customers resumed hiring. Expenses were reduced by placing internal staff on temporary unemployment where revenue necessitated this, for example in branches that were inactive because the sector had closed (such as the retail non-food and horeca segments). In Accent, this was done as of March 18, 2020, the first day this was allowed by the authorities. In Abylsen, internal staff were not put on temporary unemployment, thereby permitting them to remain close to those consultants that were still at the customer, allowing us to continue to detect further opportunities with those customers that were still active during the first lock-down. Further, marketing expenses and other expenses were reduced to the minimum required in 2020, while also being retooled in an effort to draw interest, such as webinars we organized for customers to explain the impact of government measures. Management also reduced capital expenditures compared to recent prior years in order to protect cash levels during Covid-19 and ----- as a precautionary measure also drew on its Existing Revolving Credit Facility in March 2020, which was subsequently repaid in June 2020. The proceeds from the Offering of the Notes will be used as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.”",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Our working capital largely consists of receivables (client billings) and payables (job candidate wages, social security, etc.) tied to individual job candidate placements. For each job candidate placement, the receivable is higher than the payable with the difference roughly representing the bill-pay spread or gross margin embedded in the client service agreement and job candidate agreements. This means that (all else being equal) when we place fewer job candidates, our working capital declines, resulting in a positive cash balance offsetting the loss of post-tax cash profit. Usually in the last quarter of the year, our working capital shows a decrease, which is reflected as cash inflow in the cashflow statement. This is because usually in the second and third quarters of the year working capital is at its highest due to ramp-up of sales growth in receivables and high payables that tend to occur during this period, such as holiday payments, accident insurance, and employers liability insurance. The working capital dynamics and corresponding downside protection for our cash flows are also evident in our recent performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, we had a positive change in working capital, while in 2019 and 2021 we had a negative change in working capital. This demonstrates the counter cyclical nature of our working capital profile which typically unwinds during periods of economic downturn, thereby generating larger cash inflow. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our change in working capital as a percentage of revenue was (1.1)%, 4.2% and (0.1)%, respectively. Working capital changes amounted to negative €66.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to negative €18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily impacted by the timing of payments of wages and salaries and VAT. Working capital changes amounted to negative €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the increased usage of the factoring program at Accent and GRITT. In addition, working capital was impacted by the Covid19 pandemic which led to a decline in sales, as well as by the factoring program we launched at TIMEPARTNER. In June 2021, we also launched factoring programs at Continu Professionals and Covebo, but these were offset by increased sales during the year as economies revived in 2021. Working capital changes amounted to €67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to negative €18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the increased usage of the factoring program at Accent and GRITT. In addition, working capital was impacted by the Covid ----- 19 pandemic which led to a decline in sales, as well as by the factoring program we launched at TIMEPARTNER. _Invoicing_ In order to minimize our credit risk, we follow practices in relation to the issuance and timing of invoices to customers. In the specialized talent solutions segment, invoicing is typically done on a weekly basis to customers, with payment terms ranging from zero up to 60 days, but with a majority on a 30 day payment term. Customers with no credit history or very small customers receive a zero or seven day credit, allowing us to closely monitor payment behavior, and to withhold rendering services (i.e., people at work) if a payment is not made when due. In the engineering & consulting segment, customers are on average typically somewhat larger SMEs or are large companies such as financial, transportation or industrial firms. In this segment, invoicing cycles are most often on a monthly basis, with payment terms between 30 to 60 days, or in France, up to 90 days. It should be noted that the company has a credit insurance policy in place covering all Group entities, up to a limit of €250.0 million.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

The change was primarily due to a lower amount of cash outflow for acquisitions in 2020, as compared to the outflow of €26.4 million in 2019 and lower earn-out payments in 2020 as compared to 2019. ----- _Net cash flow from financing activities_ Net cash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of €146.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared with a cash outflow of €144.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the borrowings received from an additional add-on facility of €190.0 million on February 3, 2022 and our previous revolving credit facility of €40.0 million which was drawn on July 20, 2022. The cash flow was also impacted by a loan to Cohedron that has been paid back after its acquisition in 2021 for an amount of € 80.2 million. Net cash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of €159.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with a cash inflow of €78.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was principally due to the repayment of existing loans of Cohedron following its acquisition in 2021, the cash inflow of €200.0 million in 2020 received from the offering of the Existing Senior Subordinated Notes and the cash out flow in 2020 relating to a leaver event in an amount of €37.6 million.

Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of these currencies of +/-10% is considered as immaterial. ----- _Interest rate risk_ Our interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose our cash flow to an interest rate risk which is offset by the interest rate caps. On an as adjusted basis for the Offering, most of our indebtedness will consists of the Notes and borrowings under the Facilities and the Bridge Facility. The Notes will be issued at, and following the Conversion Date, the Bridge Facility will bear, a fixed interest rate. The Facilities bear, and prior to the Conversion Date the Bridge Facility bears, variable interest rates, which for loans denominated in euros is essentially fixed when the reference interest rate is below zero, due to the interest rate floor. Following the Acquisition Closing Date, we entered into hedging instruments covering approximately 50% of the Facilities at the level of the Issuer to hedge interest rate risk exposure under the Facilities, and we plan to enter into additional hedging agreements to cover 75% to 100% of the Facilities to hedge our interest rate risk exposure.

We have policies to ensure that the services are provided to customers with an appropriate credit history. Credit risk is managed locally by each subgroup (brand) and certain companies have credit insurance in place. Credit risk mainly arises as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables. The credit quality of customers, considering the financial position of customers, past experience and other factors, is closely assessed by the credit department on a regular basis. During 2020, a credit insurance program was set-up throughout the Group to enable us to have control over open receivables during the challenging Covid-19 pandemic. Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the finance committee. The utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by our counterparties. _Impairment of financial assets_ We have three types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model: - trade receivables for sales of services; - contract assets resulting from project services in progress; and - debt investments carried at amortized cost. While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was no identified impairment loss. _Trade receivables_ ----- We apply the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before each reporting year-end, and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. Forward-looking information has been considered in assessing the Expected Credit Loss impairment under IFRS 9, taken into consideration the possible downside resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. This did not result in a significant impact on the Expected Credit Loss model assumptions. Trade receivables and project related receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, among others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with us, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 120 days past due. Several factors are considered in assessing the likelihood of impairment which is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item. We first apply the policy relating to impairment of the trade receivables under the incurred loss model, and then, for the rest of receivables which are not provided for, we apply the expected credit loss model, and recognize an additional provision. As of December 31, 2021, 78% of our trade receivables were less than one month old, 13% were between one month and two months old and the remaining 8% were between two months and one year or two or more years old.

We operate through two distinct segments: engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions. Our engineering and consulting segment is focused on supplying clients with high-skilled white-collar consultants and mid to highskilled professionals to meet clients’ specialized needs in a variety of end-markets including financial, industrial and construction end-markets. Through this segment, we also staff one to three-year construction projects, mainly through secondment or time and materials contracts. Our specialized talent solutions typically supplies a small number of high demand mid-and lower skilled blue-collar and white-collar workers to clients for specialized positions on a temporary basis. We source our candidates both from our primary markets and also increasingly from our international recruitment network. Across both segments, in addition to the positive secular trends supporting the whole staffing solutions industry, the diversity of our clients’ end-markets and geographic markets supports our business resiliency and outlook. Staffing solutions providers fall into one of three categories: mono-specialists, multi-specialists and generalists. A specialty in this sense is a combination of at least two out of three types of expertise: (i) functional expertise, or a focus on a specific skill level or specific job functions (such as lawyers, engineers, low-skilled blue-collar workers); (ii) industrial expertise, a focus on a specific end-market (such as food production or construction); and (iii) local expertise, a focus on a given region or city. Mono- and multi-specialists (which only differ from each other based on the number of specialties they serve) provide a focus on a given specialty with a dedicated sales force, specific processes and tailored value proposition focused typically on smaller volumes per client and a possible focus on a specific client size. Generalists, on the other hand serve a broad range of activities, clients, contract sizes and contract types with generalist sales forces, similar processes and offer less tailored solutions to a wide range of clients.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

After dropping to approximately €81 billion in 2020 due to the pandemic, the market recovered in 2021, totaling approximately €94 billion (the “Total Market”). These four key geographic markets are characterized by high average salaries, low unemployment and a high demand for scarcity-driven profiles and are well developed and mature in the temporary staffing and consulting fields. As a result of these trends, the number of temporary workers in these markets has increased significantly over the last decade. Our Total Market reflects the type of staffing markets for which we provide services in our primary geographies on a country basis, but it does not reflect the ----- narrower type of job candidates that many of our business units recruit and supply to clients or the specific end-market niches on which they concentrate. _Source: Staffing Industry Analysts (Global Staffing Industry Market Estimates and Forecast November 2022; Largest Staffing Firms in Belgium 2022; Largest Staffing Firms in the Netherlands and Market Overview (December 2021); Largest Staffing Firms in Germany (December 2021), Largest Staffing Firms in France and Market Overview (December 2021))_ As shown above, the staffing market in the countries in which we operate are expected to grow from €94 million in aggregate revenue for 2021 at a rate of 5% per annum to a total of €107 billion in aggregate revenue by 2024 in the absence of a downturn in the broader economy.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.4,Belgium,18.4.1,Primary Regulatory Framework,"The most common situations in which temporary staffing is authorized: (i) as a replacement for a permanent worker; (ii) during temporary increase of work; (iii) execution of unusual work; (iv) ensuring artistic performance; and (v) in order to employ the job candidate as a permanent worker (insertion _professionnelle/instroom)._ In the following cases, recourse to temporary work is also prohibited or limited: - It is forbidden to resort to temporary employment for the replacement of an employee when the suspension of the performance of the employment contract of the permanent employee is due to a lack of work for economic reasons or in case of bad weather conditions - It is possible that restrictions on recourse to agency work are foreseen under collective or sectoral or company agreements - Temporary employment is still not allowed in certain public sectors - It is forbidden to resort to temporary work when a strike or lockout is in progress in an enterprise, and a temporary employment agency is prohibited from sending temporary workers to or keeping them at work in an enterprise that is in such a situation - When the user has not obtained permission from the union _Permits or other authorizations_ In order to engage in temporary staffing, a staffing services provider is required to obtain and maintain mandatory permits from each relevant regional authority within Belgium, which may have different eligibility requirements and conditions. A staffing services provider must obtain a permit from each region in which it wants to operate, even if its registered office is located in a different region in Belgium. Each region also has specific rules to allow, under certain conditions, a staffing services provider which already has a certification in one of the three regions of Belgium and wants to extend its activity nationally, to automatically get the same permit in the other regions. Permits for temporary staffing are given for an indefinite period or a definite period. _Contractual framework_ The employment of a temporary employee at a client requires the conclusion of: ----- - a commercial agreement between the staffing services provider and the client that must be put in place in writing within seven days from the commencement day of the temporary employee’s employment; - an employment agreement between the staffing services provider and the temporary employee that must be in writing and must, at a minimum, contain certain mandatory term; and - the intent to enter into an employment contract for temporary work between the staffing services provider and the temporary employee. The maximum duration of the temporary staffing and the applicable procedure to follow both vary according to the applicable scenario. _Employment terms and compensation_ The compensation of a job candidate may not be less than the compensation to which such job candidate would have been entitled had such job candidate been a regular permanent employee of the client. During the period of temporary agency work, the job candidate has the same rights as permanent employees with respect to access to the infrastructure and services of the client, unless different treatment is objectively reasonable. Furthermore, the rules on working time that apply to the client also apply to the job candidate, unless a specific exception is provided. _Termination_ In general, if an employment agreement between the staffing services provider and the temporary employee is terminated by either party, the non-terminating party is entitled to a termination compensation unless such termination is made in the case of force majeure. In the case the staffing services provider is the terminating party, no termination compensation is due if the termination is attributable to the client, and provided that the staffing solutions provider redeploys the dismissed job candidate to another client for the remaining period of the terminated agreement under identical working conditions and with an identical salary. No termination compensation is due to the temporary employee should he refuses such redeployment. Certain specific termination requirements need to be complied with in case the temporary employee is employed to replace a permanent employee. _Liability for damages_ Under Belgian law, only the client may be liable to a third party for damage suffered by such third party caused by a fault of the temporary employee in the course of performing his activities for the client. _Fines, penalties and other enforcements_ Civil, administrative and/or criminal penalties may be imposed in case of a breach of the prohibition of secondment, including breach of the abovementioned conditions to conduct temporary staffing activities: - potential nullity of the employment agreement between the employee and employer (or the staffing solutions provider); - the client and the job candidate are deemed to have entered into an employment agreement for an indefinite duration. However, the job candidate concerned may terminate this indefinite contract at any time, without notice and without paying the client or the actual employer any compensation. The job candidate may exercise this termination right up to the date on which their service to the client is scheduled to end; - the staffing solutions provider and the job candidate are deemed to have entered into an employment agreement for an indefinite duration. However, the job candidate concerned may ----- terminate this indefinite contract, without notice or any compensation, within seven days of commencing employment; - the staffing solutions provider and the client are jointly liable for the payment of the social security contributions, salary and benefits arising from the new employment agreement; - the client is liable for any damage caused by the job candidate (based on article 1384 of the Belgian Civil Code); - administrative or criminal fines may be imposed on the staffing solutions provider and on the client, as well as an operating ban. Fines are multiplied by the number of job candidates involved (maximum up to 100). _Health and safety obligations_ The client is responsible for the implementation of all rules on health and safety at the workplace and the welfare of a job candidate during the period in which he works for the client, as the client exercises authority over the job candidate is therefore deemed the actual employer during this period and. As a result, the client is required to comply with the welfare legislation for the job candidate, such as preparing workstation records, ensuring proper on-boarding process, making suitable personal protective equipment available and conducting investigation into any material accidents at work. The client must also otherwise guarantee the same level of protection of a job candidate in terms of health of safety, as guaranteed to its regular permanent employees. Before a job candidate starts working for a client, the client must provide the staffing solutions provider with all necessary information on the required professional qualifications and conditions for the job, as well as on the specific features of the work position. The staffing solutions provider, for its part, takes care of the occupational accident insurance and prior health surveillance of the temporary worker if the client’s job sheet requires it. The staffing solutions provider is thus responsible for prior health surveillance and also for mandatory vaccinations and has a role in maternity protection. Other health and safety obligations generally lie with the client, but in the case of authorized secondment of staff, such obligations remain with the staffing solutions provider (who are effectively employers) in accordance with the instructions relating to health and safety issues set out in services agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.4,Belgium,18.4.2,Other Regulatory Frameworks,"Whereas most of our business is conducted in the regulatory framework outlined above, we are subject to certain additional regulation based on the specific nature of the services we provide in each jurisdiction. Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and regulations that apply to these services. _Temporary outsourcing of employees_ Certain of our Powerhouses also conduct consulting and secondment staffing (“temporary outsourcing”) activities in Belgium. As with temporary staffing, temporary outsourcing is not considered as prohibited secondment when a number of strict legal rules are met. An agreement must be signed between a contractor (which would be the staffing solutions provider) and a client to provide a certain service, perform a certain task or work on a specific project, rather than the provision of staff (which could be considered a prohibited secondment), including a detailed list of the instructions which the client may give to the temporary staff. Clients may indeed give instructions to the temporary staff, provided that instructions, subject to certain exceptions, (a) are defined in a written agreement between the consulting agency (in our case, the staffing solutions provider) and the client, the instructions do not ----- erode the staffing company’s authority over its staff, and are communicated to the client’s works council; or (b) relate to the client’s health and safety obligations. _Temporary outsourcing of self-employed workers_ Belgian law also allows for outsourcing self-employed workers or freelancers only when no party exercises an employer’s authority over the worker. If the parties (incorrectly) qualify their relationship as an independent relationship rather than an employment relationship, this can result in specific liabilities for the party that is considered to be the employer in the event of a re-characterization of the self-employed relationship into an employment relationship. Such a determination is made based on all factual circumstances including the following four main criteria: the will of the parties as expressed in the agreement, the level of freedom to organize working time, the level of freedom to organize work, and the level of hierarchical control. For specific sectors (such as construction, transport, cleaning, security and surveillance and agriculture), certain legal presumptions apply. Re-qualification criteria for Belgium are set out in a Program Act of December 27, 2006 and as well as in case law. _Search and selection services_ The staffing solutions provider may also use its pool of job candidates to provide recruitment services and also arrange for initial placements. Regional authorities may have different eligibility requirements and conditions to conduct search and selections services.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.4,Belgium,18.4.3,,"The below graph, based on data from Federgon, the Belgian federation of staffing agencies, illustrates the year-on-year growth evolution of the number of hours worked daily by temporary agency workers, seasonally and calendar-basis adjusted data, in Belgium starting January 2020. _Source: Federgon_ The temporary hours worked experienced a strong decline in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by a sharp rebound in April 2021, to then come back to a more flattish state. The temporary work sector in Belgium showed an extraordinary capacity for resilience in 2020. In March and April 2020, during the first confinement, the sector experienced a gigantic decline, with a loss of almost half of its volume of activity. The sector then gradually recovered over the months. In Belgium there was a total decline of 15.2% in 2020. Belgium had its peak levels in temporary work in April 2021 (59.9%), with the increase in the number of hours worked daily by temporary agency workers was driven by the rise in activity in the service voucher sector. _Source: World Bank_ ----- _Source: Eurostat, as of the fourth quarter of each year, unless stated_ In Belgium, in line with the rest of our key geographies, we can see a tight labor market with increasing demand due to macro-economic uncertainty and labor scarcity. Belgium unemployment rate has been growing since its lowest value in 2019 (5.4%), although it still was relatively low at 6.4% in 2021, below the last 10 years average of 7.1%. In the second quarter of 2022, there were no less than 213,822 vacancies in Belgium (an increase of 24% compared to the second quarter of 2021) and reaching its historical peak levels according to Eurostat. According to SIA, Belgium staffing revenue was €8.6 billion in 2021 and is expected to increase by 4% in 2022 and 6% in 2023. In Belgium, secondment of staff is prohibited, except in specific cases provided by law. Secondment of staff is defined as when an employer “lends out” its employees to a third party for the services of these employees, and that the third party exercises part of the employer’s authority over such employees. The compliance obligations regarding welfare at work, however, remain with the employer and not the third party. The third party generally does not assume the full authority of the employer over the employees on secondment, and any authority the third party has over the employees will have to be expressly specified in a written agreement executed between the employer and the third party, and any such contractual authority will have to be exercised according to the provisions in the written agreement and generally does not erode the employer’s authority over its employee in any way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the client can give instructions relating to health and safety issues to the employees concerned. ----- Exceptions to this general prohibition include: temporary staffing (also called “temporary agency work”) and other specific situations such as permitted posting for a limited time, posting within the framework of an employment pathway recognized by the region, posting as part of an employer grouping and specific posting in the public sector. In the case of temporary staffing, a job candidate (the employee, also called “interim worker”) is hired by a staffing services provider (the employer) with the intention of being put at the disposal of a client of such staffing services provider. The staffing solutions provider remains the sole legal employer, while transferring the exercise of the actual employer’s authority to the client during the temporary assignment (i.e., the client will give instructions to the job candidate with regard to the work to be carried out). Conditions to the recruiting of job candidates for the purpose of putting them at the disposal of a client are strictly defined and the working conditions of such job candidates are required by law to be similar to the working conditions of the permanent employees of the client executing the same job. Temporary staffing is mainly regulated by the Act of July 24, 1987 on Temporary Work, Interim Work and Secondment of Employees to Users (as amended) (the “Act on Temporary Work”), which implements the Temporary Agency Work Directive. Specific rules on temporary staffing apply in some sectors, such as the construction sector.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.5,France,18.5.1,Primary Regulatory Framework,"In France, the loan of a job candidate (worker) to a client is strictly regulated under the French Labor Code. Except in certain limited circumstances such as temporary staffing (portage salarial; which requires specific accreditation) or temporary work agencies, loaning workers to a client may only be provided on a not-for-profit basis; any costs invoiced by the staffing solutions provider to the client beyond the employee’s salary, social security charges and professional expenses is prohibited. Additionally, such arrangements require an amendment in the employment contract between the staffing solutions provider and employee, an inter-company agreement between the client and the staffing solutions provider, and the consultation and consent of the relevant works councils. _Permits or other authorizations_ Staffing solutions providers using the contractual framework described below do not require any permit or authorization for their business in France, other than standard registrations applicable to every company operating in France with its own employees. _Contractual framework_ Staffing solutions providers may offer consultants or job candidates to a client on a temporary and forprofit basis under the framework of a services agreement (contrat de prestation de services), given certain conditions. A qualifying services agreement encompasses temporary services provided to a client specific to a certain project, involving specialized skills, techniques, or know-how. Additionally, for workers to be provided on a for-profit basis under a services agreement, their labor must be closely related to the main purpose or project of the services agreement and be included within the broader services being provided by the staffing solutions provider to the client. Key factors as to whether a for-profit staffing under a services agreement complies with the regulatory requirements are the following: - Specific know-how of the service provider: the services must require specialized skills or knowhow not existing within the client. ----- - Authority over job candidates: even if the services must be performed in coordination with the management of the client, the service provider must retain authority over the job candidates assigned to a client. - Equipment to carry out the work: the services provider must have and use its own equipment, such as gloves, shoes, glasses and safety harness, to carry out the work, and the client must not lend the equipment necessary to provide the agreed services. _Employment terms and compensation_ Compensation: must be calculated on a flat-fee basis and may not be calculated on an hourly rate basis, as this would suggest that the provision of services is limited to the provision of labor. _Termination_ Termination of employment agreements is governed by standard rules and regulations applicable to every company operating in France with its own employees. If the staffing solutions provider has entered into an indefinite-term employment agreement with the job candidate, the employment contract can be terminated by the staffing solutions provider for real and serious cause at any time provided that the applicable notice period is complied with. The staffing solutions provider and the job candidate can also enter into a mutual termination agreement, which would then be ratified by the labor authorities. Finally, the job candidate may also resign from their position provided that the applicable notice period is complied with. If the staffing solutions provider has entered into a fixed-term employment contract with the job candidate, the employment contract can only be prematurely terminated (1) if the parties so agree, (2) in case of gross misconduct, (3) in case of force majeure, (4) if the employee is declared unfit to work by the occupational doctor, or (5) if the employee has found an indefinite-term employment. In any other cases, the employment contract runs its course until its initially-set termination date. _Liability for damages_ Under French law, the client is liable for all damages done to a third party, on the worksite or during work. However, staffing solutions providers remain liable for costs related to injuries caused by occupational accidents suffered by its in-house employees in the course of their work. _Fines, penalties or other enforcements_ If the abovementioned contractual framework is not complied with, the services agreement could be qualified as an illicit loan of workers or the criminal offence of bargaining, for which the client and the staffing solutions providers (including their respective legal representatives) can be held criminally liable. Penalties for such violations can carry a maximum fine of €375,000 and other potential penalties for a client or staffing solutions provider, and a maximum fine of €75,000 or a maximum prison sentence of five years for the legal representatives of the client or service provider. _Health and safety obligations_ As job candidates are officially assigned to and working on the client’s premises, the client must comply with labor and workplace regulations with respect to assigned job candidates, such as health and safety regulations. In this respect, if protection equipment must be worn by the job candidates, such equipment must be provided by the staffing solutions providers. Obligations relating to occupational medical surveillance are also the responsibility of the staffing solutions providers. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

In effect, the law states that the relationship between a staffing services provider and a temporary agency worker qualifies as an employment agreement. In principle, there is no requirement for an agreement between the client and the temporary employee. Under the current definition, as interpreted by the Dutch Supreme Court, both the traditional forms of temporary agency work as well as payrolling qualify as temporary agency work. However, for payrolling, there is a separate legal and contractual framework, as set out below under “Payrolling”. _Permits or other authorizations_ The SNA quality mark (SNA-keurmerk) is an accreditation for staffing solutions providers.

Although not mandatory for staffing solutions providers to obtain the SNA quality mark, it is important in practice. _Contractual framework_ In case of a general temporary agency agreement, the staffing solutions provider has more flexibility in framing the contractual relationship with the job candidate, including the possibility of applying more fixed term contracts and of terminating the contract if the client retracts the assignment. On the other hand, in case of a secondment or consultancy agreement, the staffing solutions providers generally have an indefinite term contract with the job candidate, and such contract cannot be terminated even if the client retracts the assignment. ----- In addition to Dutch employment law, the largest temporary staffing organization in industry (the “ABU”) and the largest Dutch trade unions have agreed on a collective labor agreement for the temporary employment agency industry (the “ABU CLA”). The current ABU CLA for 2021 to 2023 was declared contractually binding for the sector as of August 25, 2022, which applies to all staffing solutions providers that fall within its scope—irrespective of whether a staffing solutions provider is a member of the ABU. In effect, the ABU CLA provides that, over three phases, as temporary agency workers are employed for longer periods of time, the temporary agency worker gradually becomes entitled to more job security and secondary benefits, such as a pension and training. There is also another collective labor agreement for staffing solutions providers known as the NBBU CLA. The NBBU CLA is not declared generally binding and only applies to staffing solutions providers who are a member of NBBU, another employers’ organization for the industry. Staffing solutions providers who are a member of NBBU, are explicitly excluded from the scope of the ABU CLA. Although they are formally still two different CLAs, the current ABU CLA and NBBU CLA contain substantively the same employment terms and conditions. In general, the DCC imposes restrictions on (i) the number of successive fixed term employment agreements that the employer (in this case, staffing solutions provider) can enter into with an employee and (ii) the total duration of such fixed term employment agreements. If an employer enters into more than three successive fixed term employment agreements, or if the total duration of the successive fixed term employment agreements is more than three years, the last fixed employment agreement is converted into an indefinite term employment agreement by operation of law. This rule is referred to as the statutory “chain rule” (ketenregeling). When an employment agreement qualifies as a temporary agency agreement, this has significant implications for the statutory possibilities to maintain a ‘flexible’ employment relationship. By way of a collective labor agreement, it is possible to deviate even further from the chain rule as follows: (i) The maximum number of successive fixed term employment agreements is six and the maximum total duration of such fixed term employment agreements is three years. In addition, the ABU CLA provides that the exemption from the chain rule for temporary agency agreements is extended from 26 weeks to 52 weeks of employment. During the exemption period, it is possible to enter into an indefinite number of fixed term employment agreements, and the number and duration of the fixed term employment agreements during this period do not count toward the maximum total number and duration. (ii) In practice, the above means that a temporary agency agreement can be a “flexible” employment relationship for a total of four years, with the first disapplying the chain rule and with a temporary employment clause (as described below) and the next three years with up to six fixed term employment agreements. (iii) Further, it is possible to agree on a written provision whereby the employment agreement between the employee and the staffing solutions provider terminates by operation of law if the posting of the employee at the client ends at the request of the client. This provision is referred to as the “temporary employment clause” (uitzendbeding). The ABU CLA provides that such provision is valid during the first 52 weeks instead of 26 weeks of employment. _Employment terms and compensation_ An employee that is made available to a client is in principle entitled to receive the same basic employment terms and conditions as the employees of the client working in the same or equivalent positions (article 8 of the Placement of Personnel by Intermediaries Act). The basic employment terms and conditions include salary and other compensation, working hours and vacation entitlement. The ABU CLA validly limits the number of compensatory elements that need to be applied. Variable ----- compensation, for example, is excluded. Limited exceptions apply for a so-called “allocation group” (i.e., persons appointed by the government as having a “distance to the labor market” and persons without a basic qualification who will follow qualifying training via the staffing solutions provider). These employees receive wages determined by the staffing solutions provider in accordance with the ABU CLA. Furthermore, after one year of employment on the basis of a so-called ‘on-call’ agreement (in short, without a fixed number of working hours), temporary agency workers (and other on-call employees) should be offered a fixed number of working hours that is the average of their working hours over the last twelve months. In addition, in case of an ‘on-call’ agreement, employers are required to pay full compensation if an assignment is altered within four days prior to commencement. _Termination_ A staffing solutions provider may terminate an employment agreement in principle (i) if the posting of the employee with the client ends within the term of the temporary employment clause, if contractually provided for, (ii) against the end of the employment agreement, subject to an advance notice of one month or (iii) with permission from the cantonal court. In general, if an employer wishes to terminate a fixed term employment agreement before the end of its term or an indefinite term employment agreement, it must show that it has a lawful ground for termination and that the employee cannot be redeployed in another suitable position within the group within a reasonable period of time. Employees, including temporary workers, are entitled to a transitional payment upon termination of employment at the employer’s initiative (which includes the non-renewal of a fixed term employment agreement at the employer’s initiative). _Liability for damages_ Typically, liability towards a client for damage suffered by that client as a result of fault of its temporary agency workers is borne by the client. Occasionally, however, a staffing solutions provider may be liable for such damage. _Fines, penalties or other enforcements_ The law provides specific penalties for non-compliance with the labor law, and the Dutch Labor Inspectorate enforces fines and penalties in relation to any violations of the labor law. Under the Foreign Nationals Employment Act, an employer is obligated to ensure its employees are allowed to work in the Netherlands. If a foreign employee works in the country without a valid permit, the employer risks a fine. A fine can also be imposed if there is no valid registration in the trade register of the staffing services provider in accordance with the Work Allocation by Intermediaries Act. An employer is also obligated to adhere to the work hours requirements set out in the Working Hours Act, and any violation of this law may result in a fine. In addition, the Dutch Labor Inspectorate also enforces the application of the “wage correlation norm”. This norm prescribes that minimum standards and wage components should be applied to temporary agency workers on par with regular employees in comparable positions. _Health and safety obligations_ The staffing solutions provider is obliged to assure that it receives, and makes available, a hazard identification and risk assessment (risico-inventarisatie en—evaluatie) from the client. Furthermore, the staffing solutions provider is obliged to inform the temporary agency worker of the risks at the workplace. In the event of non-compliance with these obligations, the staffing solutions provider may be liable towards its temporary agency workers for damages as a result of inadequate working conditions at the workplace. The temporary agency workers can also bring a claim for damages against ----- the relevant client, so the temporary agency workers may, at their discretion, make a claim against the staffing solutions provider, the client or both.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,Netherlands,18.6.2,Other Regulatory Frameworks,"Whereas most of our business is conducted in the regulatory framework outlined above, we are subject to certain additional regulation based on the specific nature of the services we provide in each jurisdiction. Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and regulations that apply to these services. _Payrolling_ In the case of payrolling, the agency takes on the administrative and financial obligations for, but is not involved in the recruitment of, consultants. Furthermore, the consultants are (in principle) exclusively provided to one client. Although payrolling is formally considered a form of temporary agency work, there is a legal distinction between “regular” temporary agency agreements and payrolling agreements. Under the new legislation that entered into force on January 1, 2020, the rules regarding payrolling have been significantly amended. The ABU CLA does not apply to payrolling agreements anymore as of 1 January 2020 (with the exception of limited transitional arrangements). Payroll employees are entitled to all terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions (including certain pension entitlements as from January 1, 2021). The same rules relating to fixed term employment agreements and termination of employment agreements apply for payroll employees as for regular employees of the client. A temporary employment clause and the additional flexibility to enter into fixed term employment agreements as set out above are no longer applicable to payroll employees as of 1 January 2020. Specifically for payrolling, the Dismissal Regulation (Ontslagregeling) contains stricter rules for showing a reasonable ground for termination. For a payroll employer, the fact that the posting of an employee at the third party ends will not be a reasonable ground to terminate the employment agreement with such employee. Instead, the situation at the third party will be taken into account to determine whether a reasonable termination ground exists. _Outsourcing of self-employed workers_ We are subject to the Dutch law on deregulation of labor relations (Wet deregulering beoordeling _arbeidsrelaties) (the “DBA”). Pursuant to the DBA, different rules apply depending on whether the_ labor relation is an independent relationship or an employment relationship. For example, in the case of an employment relationship, the employer must withhold and pay payroll taxes. In addition, the employer must usually continue to pay wages during illness and vacations. A determination of whether a relationship is an employment relationship or an independent relationship is made based on all factual circumstances, including the following three main criteria for establishing an employment relationship: one party undertakes to (i) perform work personally (ii) under the supervision of the other party (iii) for remuneration. If the parties (incorrectly) qualify their relationship as an independent relationship rather than an employment relationship, this can result in specific liabilities for the party that is considered to be the employer in the event of a re-characterization of the self-employed relationship into an employment relationship. _Search and selection services_ Often, in addition to staffing services, staffing solutions providers also provide staff recruitment services to their commercial clients. The staffing solutions provider can use its pool of job candidates for their recruitment and also arrange for initial placements. Rendering recruitment services does not require an additional permit. ----- _Quality assurance_ We are subject to the professional standards mandated by the _Landelijk Kwaliteitsbureau CBM, a professional standards regulator that assesses and oversees quality requirements in relation to curatorship, guardianship and mentorship. In addition, a new quality framework has been proposed in 2021 by the Nederlandse Vereniging voor _Veiligheidskunde (the “NVVK”), a professional association actively involved in promoting safety_ standards. NVVK membership is a requirement for companies engaging in client contracts. Under this framework, two certifying organizations have been identified to carry out audit on NVVK members. The scope of the audit process, plan, procedures and reporting requirements are currently still being developed. _Data protection_ We are subject to data protection regulations, including the GDPR, in respect of employee personal data that we process. We occasionally process employee medical data.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Germany,18.7.1,Primary Regulatory Framework,"Jurisdiction under AÜG is established where there is a connection to German territory; it thus regulates both domestic staffing as well as cross-border staffing, for example where job candidates are being assigned to Germany by foreign staffing solutions providers to perform services on German territory. _Permits or other authorizations_ In Germany, temporary staffing is generally impermissible without a valid permit from the relevant authorities. If the staffing solutions provider does not have the permit required, an employment relationship between the client and the job candidate will be assumed pursuant to the AÜG, commencing at the time at which the work is to commence as set forth in the agreement between the client and the staffing solutions provider, unless the job candidate objects and declares to the Federal Employment Agency a preference to stay with the staffing solutions provider. To protect the client, German law requires the staffing solutions provider to confirm in the agreement with the client that it has obtained the necessary permit. Procedurally, permits are typically granted for one-year terms, with the option to convert into an unlimited term permit following the grant of three consecutive one-year permits. This permit is specific to the staffing solutions provider. Permits may be denied, or revoked if already granted, for statutory reasons such as the unreliability of the staffing solutions provider, noncompliance with safety and health regulations, or non-compliance with the AÜG. _Contractual framework_ The general contractual framework is that a staffing solutions provider concludes an employment agreement with a job candidate and then places this job candidate with a client. No employment agreement is concluded between the job candidate and the client, but the client is granted the right to instruct and direct the job candidate based on an agreement between the staffing solutions provider and the client (“German Service Agreement”). Additionally, recent changes in the AÜG have imposed specific mandatory provisions in German Service Agreements, including, as mentioned, a representation that the aforementioned permit has been granted, a description of the parameters of the ----- services provided, a description of occupational qualifications, and details regarding working conditions, such as wages and benefits. The job candidates assigned under the engagement can either be named in the German Service Agreement itself or separately at a later stage with explicit reference to the German Service Contract. The German Service Agreement must explicitly be titled a “staffing agreement” (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsvertrag) and must be signed by wet ink or a qualified electronic means signature before the job candidate commences at the client. Since the job candidate remains the staffing solutions provider’s permanent employee, the provider retains certain obligations from the employment relationship, such as paying the social security contributions. Moreover, the provider must inform its job candidates before each assignment that they will be placed as a temporary worker and provide a written copy of the essential contents of the assignment. Finally, the staffing solutions provider must involve its works council (if there is one) when the job candidate is hired and dismissed. All such job candidates, being full members of the staffing solutions provider’s staff, can vote in and run for works council elections. _Employment terms and compensation_ In order to emphasize the “temporary” nature of temporary staffing, the AÜG amendments provide that the same job candidate cannot be assigned to the same client for more than 18 consecutive months. A period of at least three months and one day where the job candidate is not employed at a given client can reset this maximum 18 month period. Exceptions to this maximum period are only possible by way of collective bargaining agreements of the client’s industrial sector or works council agreements on the basis of such collective bargaining agreements. Though the employment of the job candidate is temporary for the client, all such job candidates must typically remain employees of the staffing solutions provider under the German Act on Part-Time and Temporary Employment (Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz), which applies to all temporary employees in Germany. During the assignment, German law requires the main working conditions of the job candidate, including the compensation, to be the same as those of a comparable permanent employee. Compensation comprises everything the job candidate would have been entitled to, had such worker been hired directly by the client (equal pay), and includes, among other things, holiday pay, sick pay, allowances and benefits and must be paid by the staffing solutions provider as the employer. Therefore, the staffing solutions provider has the administrative burden to amend the job candidate’s compensation with every placement in line with on-site conditions. Derogations from the main working conditions are possible on the basis of a collective bargaining agreement. However, with regard to equal pay, the possibility of any derogation is limited, because all job candidates must receive compensation equal to that of the client’s comparable permanent workers after nine months. A longer derogation period can only be agreed by collective bargaining agreements granting a gradual increase of the candidate’s to the level of the permanent employees’ compensation within 15 months, beginning in the seventh week of the temporary employment. Derogations from equal pay are also never applicable with regard to job candidates who have been employed by the client (or its group) during the last six months preceding the placement. _Termination_ If the staffing solutions provider wishes to terminate a job candidate’s employment agreement after six months of employment with the staffing solutions provider, it must establish that (i) it has reasonable grounds for termination; (ii) the job candidate cannot be redeployed to another suitable position with the staffing solutions provider or with a client within a reasonable period of time; and if the termination is due to economic reasons, (iii) that termination of employment was the last option. Since the German legislator wants to ease the transition from temporary to permanent work, it is forbidden for the staffing solutions provider to agree on a commission fee with the job candidate if the job candidate concludes an employment contract with the client he has been placed with after his placement. However, the staffing solutions provider is allowed to invoice the client for a commission fee. ----- _Liability for damages_ Liability for damages can be provided for in the German Service Agreement between the staffing solutions provider and the client, so they may agree on a disclaimer of liability in favor of the staffing solutions provider as well as in favor of the client or they may limit the amount of liabilities to the extent covered by insurance. Generally, liability for the staffing solutions provider is limited to the selection of qualification (Auswahlverschulden). The job candidate is liable for breaches of duties towards the client and the staffing solutions provider on a sliding scale, being fully liable only when he has violated his duties intentionally. _Fines, penalties or other enforcements_ Neglecting or violating any of the abovementioned legal requirements can lead to different severe legal penalties, based on the nature and seriousness of the breach. If the staffing solutions provider has no permit, the German Service Agreement is not compliant with the formal requirements, or the maximum staffing period is exceeded, the employment agreement is deemed void and the job candidate is considered to be an employee of the client, unless the job candidate objects and declares to the Federal Employment Agency a preference to stay with the staffing solutions provider. In addition, not complying with the permit regulations may lead to a fine of up to €30,000 for each individual case. The same fine may be imposed when the maximum staffing period has been exceeded. Higher penalties (up to €500,000) may be imposed by the German authorities if the equal pay rules have been violated or if the client has used the job candidate as a replacement for an employee on strike. Penalties may result from misclassifications of job candidates as self-employed, for example when placing job candidates with a client as free contractors, consultants, secondees or other similar arrangements, when they are de facto employees placed under a staffing arrangement. False selfemployment may have severe consequences both in employment and social security law (for example, obligations to retroactively pay social security contributions for the employer and employee), tax law (liability for income tax). If the staffing solutions provider is found to have intentionally violated the law, it may also face criminal law penalties. There have not yet been many interpretive decisions of the Federal Labor Court of the 2017 amendment of the AÜG and many details are still in dispute. _Health and safety obligations_ Job candidates officially assigned to and working for the client are fully integrated into the client’s organization; as a result, the client must comply with labor and workplace regulations, including any health and safety regulations with respect to those assigned job candidates. Both the staffing solutions provider and the client are responsible for the overall well-being of the job candidate including the job candidate’s physical and mental health, (such as by supervising working times and rest periods, protecting against unfair treatment and sexual harassment), personal data and (if applicable) his private working material. The client is required to inform job candidates prior to their assignment of any specific qualifications and professional skills they need to possess. It is the client’s obligation to inform the job candidate about dangers the job candidate may face at assignment as well as explain safety measures.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Similarly, temporary workers also declined down during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, followed by a recovery in the beginning of 2021, with the number of temporary workers now being higher than pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels. The staffing market has since recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, and since the lifting of the restrictions, the number of job registrations has then consistently increased. Although Germany has been relatively effective in managing the pandemic, the country's sizeable manufacturing sector is highly export-oriented and exposed to both supply-chain disruption and shrinking global demand. As a result, SIA estimates that total German staffing market revenue fell by 10% in 2020. Nevertheless, Germany has experienced substantial growth in 2021 (12%), which is generally set to continue at a more subdued rate in 2022 (5%) and continuing a decline into 2023 (4%) according to SIA. According to the German Federal Employment Agency, there were approximately 850,000 temporary workers in Sep 2022, a year-on-year increase of 1%, although still down 21% from the preCovid-19 pandemic peak in November 2017. ----- _Source: World Bank Source: Eurostat, as of the fourth quarter of each year, unless stated_ Amongst the four key geographies, Germany has experienced the largest decline in unemployment rates.

In Germany, temporary staffing is regulated by the Act on Staffing (Arbeitnehmeru¨berlassungsgesetz) (“AÜG”), which has been substantially amended over the years, most recently in 2017. The focus of the 2017 amendment was to strengthen permanent employment; as a result, a maximum period for temporary staffing has been introduced and formal requirements have been tightened up as has the equal pay principle.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Staffing Solutions Secular Industry Drivers,18.8.1,,"Demand for the types of solutions we provide has increased and is expected to continue growing in the future, once markets have recovered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, due to a number of positive secular trends: _Aging populations. As the population of our target markets ages and workers exit the labor pool, there_ has been an increase in competition among employers to fill the gaps left behind. This has left an opening for staffing intermediaries, especially those like our Group that have a proven track record of identifying and matching the right candidates to the right jobs, to fill these vacant positions with qualified talent. Additionally, a scarcity of talent for certain roles is driving wages up, which in turn can increase the pricing power of staffing firms for the solutions and staffing we provide. _Technological changes. In recent years, candidates are increasingly turning to online job boards when_ seeking out a position, particularly through traffic generated by mobile devices. At the same time, clients expect more efficient services at a lower cost that can only be delivered through the use of digital tools. We have also seen an increase in the number of passive job seekers who apply through targeted advertisements on social media when they were not actively searching for a position at the time. The market has also experienced the development of new platforms, such as Uber Works in the United States, which, however, announced in May 2020 the closure of their operations in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to their official press release. Such platforms may be considered competitors, since ----- they sometimes are able to attract people directly to be employed for them via freelance or independent status. Nevertheless, such platforms lack a human touch in the services they provide, and authorities in different countries monitor fair treatment of workers by these platforms and are looking to ensure that there is no unfair competition with other forms of labor. Such monitoring is especially common in the EU, where regulation and labor unions are stronger than in other countries. Career mobility and the need to re-skill._ Millennial workers, especially highly skilled ones, are increasingly mobile and seeking a varied career path, driving the need for re-skilling. This re-skilling can be provided through both formal and on-the-job training that is typically provided as part of temporary work agreements. _Diversity, inclusion and corporate social responsibility. As the diversity trend becomes mainstream_ across clients, service providers have an opportunity to provide increasing value to their clients by tapping into broad, international pools of candidates. _Increased premium on quality of life. It is increasingly difficult to find qualified candidates to fill some_ roles that offer long hours and difficult conditions, as younger generations of workers are placing a fairly large premium on happiness in their personal and professional lives. This has contributed to a supply and demand gap in certain end-markets and as a result, staffing solutions providers with a more flexible and agile organization and the ability to source and place candidates successfully, are in greater demand. _Outsourcing and offshoring. Financial pressures on companies, especially the small- to medium-sized_ enterprises (“SMEs”), have incentivized them to outsource many of their non-core functions. Further, due to accelerated business rhythms, companies are increasingly looking to obtain immediately available resources. This has led to an increased need for temporary staffing and outsourced support that can be provided rapidly on short notice. _Better economics. Especially for freelance workers, the prospect of better economics in spite of lower_ job security has been a driver of demand in the recent years. As a result of these secular trends, both employers and workers increasingly turn towards flexible staffing models, driving demand for extended workforce solutions. According to an external consultant analysis, in Belgium, Netherlands and France, the number of workers that are part of the extended workforce (i.e., contractors and other freelancers) has grown from 2016 to 2021 at a CAGR of 3.9%, 2.5% and 4.4%, respectively. These growth rates are above those registered in the total working population, which over the same period has grown at a CAGR of 1.0% in Belgium, 1.3% in the Netherlands and 0.4% in France.

It is expected that, once markets have recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, such spending will increase again going forwards and will be the key driver of growth in Abylsen’s Addressable Market, as end-markets reliant on research and development (such as the automotive, energy, pharmaceutical and aerospace industries) respond and adapt to changing technologies for their sustained growth. Additional factors such as increased outsourcing penetration (France is already one of the most mature countries for outsourcing of research and development) and increasing billing rates (moderate due to pre-existing difficulties in sourcing engineers in France) are likely to further drive market growth in the future.

Post Covid-19 pandemic, growth in Redmore’s specific client end-markets in the coming years is expected to be driven by an increasing need for specialist positions in the financial sector as a result of changing regulations, compliance, digitization and consolidation. According to external consultant analysis, Redmore’s addressable market is expected to grow at low to mid-single digit in the next five years. _Competitive landscape_ Redmore competes with various entities in the financial services end-market including the big four accounting firms (namely, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers), which accounted for approximately 40-50% of the market in 2021, as well as other professional services and consultancy firms. Although the competitive environment for each of Redmore’s niches is different, strong consolidation of the market in recent years has resulted in significant growth for both Redmore and its competitors. We believe that Redmore’s businesses are leaders in their respective Addressable Markets in terms of revenue. Redmore is built around five labels with each serving a specific niche: - _Talent&Pro focuses on secondments in the banking, insurance, pensions and actuarial end- markets. Talent&Pro is a significant player in the financial secondment market in the Netherlands, facing competition from a variety of other firms, including Brunel, which has a broad focus across IT, finance, engineering and law, Welten, which is specialized in candidate training with project based work, and Young Capital, which is a digital disruptor across the finance, sales, IT and marketing end-markets. - _Triple A_ focuses on financial consulting in actuarial and risk management, with actuarial consultancy firms, including Willis Tower Watson, Mercer, and Milliman, and the big four accounting firms as its most significant competitors. - _Profource_ focuses on finance staffing, ERP consulting and provides business process outsourcing services. As such, it maintains a unique market position which combines expertise in finance and ERP. It faces competition from the big four accounting firms, whose consulting departments include both finance and ERP, Eiffel, which is specialized in finance and legal staffing, focusing on the government sector, and DPA, which is focused on candidate training in the finance, IT and engineering end-markets. - _ITDS_ provides specialist consulting for insurance companies, pension funds and banks, focusing on risk management, digital transformation, and cost-saving programs. Competitors for ITDS are Accenture, Deloitte and Capgemini. ----- - _Vialegis primarily specializes in the legal staffing solutions market in Belgium, though it has developed activities in Spain, Luxembourg and Germany over recent years. Vialegis operates in two primary niches: (i) legal interim management and secondments and (ii) legal search and selection, both of which are relatively small and developing markets expected to grow rapidly in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

GRITT focuses on three distinct market niches each with its own specific drivers and competition: - _GRITT focuses on the secondment of engineers in Antwerp and, to a lesser extent, Flanders with a focus on the chemical, pharmaceutical and life sciences end-markets. GRITT’s market growth is driven by an increase in capital expenditures, a moderate increase in outsourcing and a moderate increase of billing rates relative to inflation. The market includes a lot of players with strong competition from certain larger Benelux competitors, such as STAR engineering as well as more specialized competition from Talenco. - _Logi-technic focuses on the secondment of technicians in East and West Flanders with a focus on recurring maintenance and facility management needs for industrial equipment in the food end-market. Logi-technic operates in a growing market due to a growing shortage of skilled technicians as a result of existing high employment rates in Flanders, driving billing rates higher as well as recurring business needs for maintenance of installed equipment. Such growth is expected to be seen in the future, once markets have recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

It is headquartered in the Netherlands, with branches throughout the Netherlands, two branches in Belgium and a branch in Germany that was opened at the beginning of 2019. Continu Professionals provides secondment solutions to clients through job candidates who are planners, foremen, superintendents, technical designers, project managers, architects and a wide variety of engineers such as in manufacturing, infrastructure and construction (including specialization in social housing corporations) research and development, and mechanical. _End-market overview and drivers_ Continu serves the Dutch engineering and construction markets, which have experienced steady growth over the past several years. Continu’s Addressable Market consists of the staffing market for infrastructure, engineering and construction end-markets in the Netherlands, with a growing presence in Belgium and Germany. Post Covid-19 pandemic, growth in Continu’s Addressable Market is expected to be mainly driven by two factors: - growth among SMEs within engineering and construction that largely stems from infrastructure projects, which typically have long project durations and tend to have a predictable revenue stream; and - a continued shortage of mid to high-skilled engineers and technicians able to work on infrastructure and engineering projects, leading to increased outsourcing penetration and accounting, as the temporary to permanent model has been successful and desirable in an environment where the demand for permanent labor exceeds its supply. ----- According to external consultant analysis, Continu’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at midsingle digit in the next five years. _Competitive landscape_ Continu benefits from a high level of expertise and broad national coverage, and is the top three player in its Addressable Market in terms of revenue. Its main competitors include: TMC, which is mostly focused on software and electrical engineering, Voort, which focuses on a similar specialty as Continu, and Brunel, which focuses on the oil and gas sector. _SOLCOM_ SOLCOM is a German specialist in contracting services covers primarily lucrative, highly specialized IT and engineering segments across various industries within the DACH region. SOLCOM mostly works with experienced freelancers only. SOLCOM facilitates and manages the process of matching clients with experienced freelancers throughout the contracting period. _End-market overview and drivers_ SOLCOM serves the German IT and engineering experts across all end industries, through qualified specialists and managers with expertise and experience in all sectors of IT and engineering. According to an external consultant analysis conducted in July 2021, the market is highly fragmented, where approximately 2,000 small players account for approximately 80% of the market, while the top 10 companies represent approximately the remaining 20%. SOLCOM’s end market is growing and resilient, driven by robust megatrends across all industries: - Increasing demand for contracting services in Germany driven by shortage of skilled workers, demographic change, increasing technological complexity and demand for digitalization - Complex legal status - Demographic change as an increasing challenge that House of HR is being able to manage through the expansion of internal divisions According to external consultant analysis, SOLCOM’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at mid to high single digit in the next five years. _Competitive landscape_ Expert know-how providers can be segmented based on their geographical and segment coverage. SOLCOM is a national specialized expert know-how provider. SOLCOM’s main competitors are divided into two sub-categories: - nationwide non-specialized: Hays, Ferchau, Gulp, SThree, Allgeier, Robert Half, Brunel, WestHouse and Krongaard; and - Nationwide specialized (in IT): Etengo, Top Itservices, Neusta and Future Consulting",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

According to external consultant analysis, Cohedron’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at low to mid-single digit in the next five years. _Competitive landscape_ The market is fragmented, but slightly consolidating mainly through M&A of leading market participants: - M&A of public specialist expected to continue (e.g., Wyzer combination of Langhenkel & Talenter in 2018, BMC acquisition by Randstad in 2017) - Consolidating municipality landscape Cohedron is positioned within the top three market participants, together with Maandag, which has lost market share due to volume-focused profile sourcing at the expense of quality and Randstad, still winning a lot of tenders due to its dedicated tender team and experience.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Engineering and Consulting,18.10.6,,"Our engineering and consulting segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu Professionals, Redmore, GRITT, SOLCOM and Cohedron Powerhouses, as well as IBB and AERO, which are Boutiques under TIMEPARTNER. Abylsen, Redmore, SOLCOM and Cohedron are the largest financial contributors to this segment. Powerhouses in this segment also generate revenue from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium. The figures below show the split of our engineering and consulting segment’s sales by brand and by geographic market, respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Note: Figures are calculated on the basis of the business unit accounts for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Sales by brand are calculated on the basis of business unit accounts or subunits, in the case AERO and IBB. Sales by geographic market primarily allocate revenue from the business units accounts to the primary geographic market of that business unit, though some adjustments ----- for revenue generated in other geographies have been reflected when possible. As a result, the percentage of sales by geographic market will not align with figures provided in our Financial Statements. Our engineering and consulting segment is focused on recruiting highly skilled professionals to work in fast-evolving and highly resilient sectors and regulatory environments such as energy, pharmaceuticals, life sciences, construction, infrastructure, finance, legal, public affairs and technology, among others, and also assists clients with the search and selection of the right candidate. The job candidate placements by the Powerhouses in this segment are typically medium- to long-term. Unlike the specialized talent solutions segment which typically generates the majority of its sales from SME clients, the Powerhouses in our engineering and consulting segment are more mixed in the percentage of clients that generate sales. The job candidates in most of our engineering and consulting Powerhouses are indefinite employees on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. As a result, our engineering and consulting segment in particular carefully monitors the end date of all job candidates’ assignments and aims to line up the next assignment before their current ones come to an end. This monitoring seeks to minimize “bench time,” which is the time during which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a client assignment. Our bench time for 2021 was approximately 0.3%. As of September 30, 2022, our engineering and consulting segment served customers through a business unit network of 110 branches, with approximately 1,705 in-house full-time equivalent employees and 12,283 job candidates at work.

Accent operates in a competitive and consolidated market where it challenges larger global staffing solutions companies or brands, as well as regional companies or brands. _End-market overview and drivers_ Post recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, growth in the Belgian staffing solutions industry will continue to be largely driven by the tightening of the Belgian labor market as employment is growing faster than the active population, particularly in Flanders. This trend is expected to result in fewer job seekers per vacancy leading to a scarcity of candidates. As a result, demand has grown for companies such as ours that are able to provide appropriate qualified candidates to clients in need of staffing and this demand is expected to continue in the future. According to external consultant analysis, Accent’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at low single digit in the next five years. _Competitive landscape_ Accent was the fourth-largest staffing provider in terms of 2017 revenue within the Belgian total staffing market, behind the larger staffing firms of Randstad, Recruit and Adecco, each of which focuses on larger accounts, which are typically lower margins.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Specialized Talent Solutions,18.11.2,Covebo,"Covebo is a blue-collar specialized staffing Powerhouse. It is focused on the Dutch specialty blue-collar staffing market, with operations in the Netherlands, as well as its branches in Hungary, Lithuania, Spain, Poland and Romania, which are part of its international recruiting network. _End-market overview and drivers_ Covebo had an Addressable Market consisting of the staffing market in the Netherlands in the trade, engineering, logistics and construction end-markets. Structural growth in Covebo’s Addressable Market is due to a variety of factors, including: - underlying growth in the Dutch construction, engineering and logistics and food production end-markets; - growth due to the increasing penetration of temporary staffing as the demand for permanent labor exceeds its supply; and - increases in billing rates to correlate with salary increases within its clients’ end-markets. There is a general scarcity in the Dutch domestic workforce willing to work in these end-markets due to changing perceptions of working conditions and possible night shifts as a result of the increased premium on quality of life global trend, favoring companies like us with the ability to source candidates for these positions internationally. _Competitive landscape_ ----- Covebo competes with smaller, regional or local competitors and larger generalists. Regional peers include: Otto Workforce, a direct competitor and that has a similar end-market focus and sourcing strategy to Covebo, though it is smaller in geographical scope; and Olympia, which is a mid-sized firm, larger than Covebo, serving most end-markets throughout the Netherlands. Smaller competitors, such as VDB, Sherpa and McDOIT, typically compete on smaller assignments but find it difficult to match Covebo on price as they provide candidates in lower volumes. The larger generalists, such as Randstad and Adecco compete heavily in volume driven projects, yet find it difficult to serve the small-volume, specialized niches where we excel and do not offer a full service package or training.

In addition, Zaquensis, previously a Powerhouse in our legacy general staffing segment, is now part of the TIMEPARTNER operation following the partial merger between TIMEPARTNER and Zaquensis in the second quarter of 2021. _German general staffing market drivers_ In the future, it is expected that growth in this market will be driven by an increase in the number of hours worked and overall temporary staffing penetration as decreasing unemployment and a shortage of low-skilled blue-collar workers will force companies to seek out alternatives to source qualified candidates. Billing rates are also expected to increase driven by the increase in minimum wages for temporary workers established as a result of regulatory reform. According to external consultant analysis, TIMEPARTNER’s Addressable Market is expected to remain flat in the next five years.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Specialized Talent Solutions,18.11.4,TMI,"On March 3, 2022, we acquired TMI, our new Powerhouse in our specialized talent solutions segment. TMI specializes in providing staffing service for the healthcare sector in the Netherlands, assisting with the recruitment of candidates for healthcare providers such as hospitals, public care institutions, ambulance staff and nursing homes. TMI also supplies temporary staff, intermediates for freelancers, and offers flexible jobs. Their job candidates usually include doctors, nursing staff, psychologists, and pharmacists. _End-market overview and drivers_ TMI is active in the attractive and growing Dutch healthcare staffing market which benefits from longterm healthcare trends where demand for healthcare professionals is high and ever-increasing. According to an external analysis, TMI’s focus markets are (size of total healthcare workforce being approximately 1.4 million employees): - nursing, care and home care (representing approximately 470,000 employees in 2020); - hospitals and other expert care & university medical centers (representing approximately 300,000 employees in 2020); - disabled care & youth care (representing approximately 200,000 employees in 2020); and ----- - mental healthcare (representing approximately 100,000 employees in 2020). Continued shortages of healthcare personnel are expected to last until 2030, driven by Netherland’s aging population and aging healthcare workforce: - Demand for healthcare and cure until 2030 is expected to increase due to the aging Dutch population: - Older than 55: 37% of the Dutch population expected by 2030 (CAGR increase of 1.6% (2016-30)). - Between 35 and 55: 24% of the Dutch population expected by 2030 (CAGR decrease of 0.7% (2016-30)). - Younger than 35: 40% of the Dutch population expected by 2030 (CAGR increase of 2016- 0.2% (2016-30)). - The Dutch healthcare workforce is expected to grow older with a CAGR increase of 4% for population above 55 (2010-30).

Both of these geographic end-markets have seen significant growth over the past years, as long term trends in the staffing solutions industry combined with a tightening labor market have increased demand for service providers like us to fill the need for specialized workers. Growth in the future will continue to be largely ----- driven by growing economies in both regions and end-markets in which House of HR’s Powerhouses provide services, as well as a large and growing gap between the demand for certain specialized positions and the supply of candidates willing to perform these jobs. Source: Company information, external consultant analysis. Note: People at work excludes StaffMe and LD Personalvermittlung as integration is ongoing; 2020 People at work impacted by Covid-19. Price analysis excludes TMI, Cohedron, Bis people, LD Personalvermittlung, StaffMe, Fid, Agium and ABMI. Sickness impacts our number of job candidates at work. The following chart shows the percentage of our job candidates that were sick at the times indicated therein. We will typically enter into an employment agreement with the job candidate and a service agreement with the client. The employment agreement is often entered into with the job candidate in connection with us entering into a service agreement with the client. In these cases, the employment agreement is for the duration of a particular client assignment, which duration will vary a great deal among our business units due to the nature of the services offered and will also be impacted by the nature of the services required by the client. In a number of our business units, in particular those in our engineering and consulting segment, the employment agreement will often be an indefinite employment agreement and for a longer duration than the service agreement with the client as a result of regulatory reasons or to facilitate recruiting job candidates. ----- Nearly all of the service agreements into which we enter with clients are time and materials service agreements, which means we are compensated under the contract for the services and materials provided by our job candidates. A small number of the service agreements we enter into with clients are projectoriented, which means we are compensated under the agreement only when our job candidates deliver the project in accordance with the specifications in the agreement. When we have a time and materials service agreement with a client, we typically bill the client for the services performed by the job candidate and pay the salary and the applicable associated benefits, fees and costs, such as social security, of the job candidate. The difference between what we bill our clients and what we pay as salary, benefits and associated costs to the job candidates is referred to as the “billpay spread,” which is a key driver of our Group’s profitability. Our business units are organized around a variety of staffing models which have varying degrees of specialization and scarcity, which impacts the bill-pay spread. We focus on providing best-in-class service, matching excellence and investing in digital initiatives to enhance our service offering as well as to automate processes and reduce costs to maximize the bill-pay spread. Other elements that are part of our business model include a focus on SME clients (who often lack in-house staff who can perform the staffing services that we provide), providing training to our job candidates and including non-solicitation or minimum fees for a particular period for job candidates in relation to the client for which they are staffed. For further information about the pricing of our job candidates in our service agreements with clients, see “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key factors affecting our results of operations.”_ The nature of the employment agreement into which we enter with job candidates and its duration (whether it is an open-ended contract for the length of an assignment or an indefinite contract that is in place whether or not the job candidate is on an assignment) will depend primarily upon the regulatory environment in which our business units operate and the type of contract needed to attract, recruit and retain job candidates. The nature of the employment agreement will also impact the termination and notice periods. Indefinite contracts typically provide for three to six month notice periods for us to terminate the employment agreement (except in Germany where terminations can happen sooner, and labor durations are also typically shorter). The flexibility of open-ended contracts typically allows us to enter into an employment agreement with the job candidate in connection with an assignment with a client and the notice periods in the service agreement will be aligned with the notice period in the employment agreement. On the other hand, as a result of the indefinite employment agreements, we experience “bench time,” which is the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a client assignment, for our job candidates with indefinite contracts. We carefully monitor the end date of all such job candidates’ assignments and aim to line up the next assignment before their current one comes to an end to minimize bench time. By minimizing a job candidate’s bench time, we aim to ensure job candidates are being utilized on billable matters and generating revenue since we will be responsible for the costs associated with employing them whether or not they are on assignment with a client. In our engineering and consulting segment, employment agreements with job candidates are typically indefinite due to the regulatory environment of the countries in which our business units in this staffing segment operate or in order to attract and retain job candidates to fill staffing shortages. In certain Powerhouses, such as Redmore, the employment agreement approach also facilitates longer and more specialized training for job candidates and deepens the relationship between ourselves and these job candidates. Within this segment, we also utilize a number of freelance job candidates (approximately 36% of job candidates at work as of September 30, 2022), primarily in the SOLCOM business, but also in the Abylsen, Continu Professionals, GRITT and Redmore Powerhouses, whom we screen and match with clients but who do not become our employees. In our specialized talent solutions segment, due to the countries in which our business units in this segment offer services and our ability to attract and recruit job candidates, we typically use fixed-term contracts with job candidates, except for our operations in Germany, where we generally enter into an indefinite employment agreement with a job candidate due to regulations on temporary staffing there. As a result, our specialized talent solutions segment also faces bench time risk with respect to job candidates in Germany. The bench time risk in the specialized talent solutions segment is, however, typically less than that in the engineering and ----- consulting segment due to the shorter periods of services typically associated with these job candidates and consequently the typically shorter notice periods required for our job candidates in this segment. Our specialized talent solutions segment is comprised of our Accent, Covebo, TIMEPARTNER (with the exception of IBB and AERO, which are part of our engineering and consulting segment) and TMI Powerhouses, with operations in Belgium, Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands, as well as branches ----- in countries that form part of their international recruiting networks. In addition, following the acquisitions of LD Personalvermittlun, we are in the process of establishing a new Powerhouse, House of Care Talents Germany, which will focus on the placements of physicians and nurses to clinics or hospitals. Our specialized talent solutions segment supplies specialized staffing to companies in certain sectors, including construction, retail and finance, among others and includes general temporary agencies delivering candidates to clients in a fast and flexible way when they are shorthanded. The figures below show the split of our specialized talent solutions segment’s sales by brand and by geographic market, respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Note: Figures are calculated on the basis of the business unit accounts for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Sales by brand calculated on the basis of business unit accounts. Sales by geographic market primarily allocate revenue from the business units accounts to the primary geographic market of that business unit, though some adjustments for revenue generated in other geographies have been reflected when possible.

Our business units in this segment typically supplies specialized staffing to clients from a diversified group of end-markets, including construction, retail and finance, among others, and includes general temporary agencies delivering candidates to clients in a fast and flexible way. The job candidate placements by the business units in this segment are typically short to medium-term. As of September 30, 2022, our specialized talent solutions segment served customers through its business units’ networks of 632 branches, with 2,958 in-house full-time equivalent employees and 60,012 job candidates at work.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,BUSINESS Overview,18.12.1,,"We are a leading provider of HR solutions in key European staffing markets, offering end-to-end temporary recruiting and outsourcing services. We supply specialized and niche staffing to primarily small and medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) clients in a diversified range of end-markets. We offer and tailor our services to the staffing needs of our clients through our engineering and consulting segment and specialized talent solutions segment, which are comprised of a well-developed portfolio of ten specialized business units, which we call Powerhouses, across various countries. We also offer digital recruiting through our dedicated platforms, using our digital tools, including, NOWJOBS, SWOP and Gighouse app, targeting low-skilled, high-volume markets with significant roll-out potential. Since our founding, we have expanded from a presence in only Belgium to more than 10 countries in Europe. Corresponding to our geographic expansion, we have also become more diversified in the endmarkets we serve, primarily through our acquisitions in recent years, which provide us with staffing capabilities in additional areas such as pharmaceutical, healthcare, life sciences, government and public administration and technology. As of September 30, 2022, we had 72,296 job candidates at work and approximately 40,858 productive people at work (meaning the number of our job candidates adjusted to reflect a 38 hour per week workweek) and 4,734 in-house full-time equivalent employees. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we had 31,456 unique clients, our Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue was €2,770.0 million and our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA was €330.5 million. Our engineering and consulting segment represents 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. This segment supplies staffing of highly-skilled professionals, such as engineering consultants and financial and insurance specialists, to fill specialized roles in a variety of end-markets, such as financial, industrial, logistics, infrastructure, public administration and construction, and, more recently, fast-evolving and highly resilient sectors such as energy, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and technology. This segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu Professionals, Redmore, GRITT, Cohedron and SOLCOM Powerhouses and has the broadest geographic footprint, with its primary operations in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The engineering and consulting segment assists clients in the search and selection of the right candidate, including for interim management and secondments, and such temporary client assignments generally last for months. The below chart illustrates in blue the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for our engineering and consulting segment. Our specialized talent solutions segment represents 46.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. This segment supplies specialized staffing of high-demand mid-skilled workers for specialized positions, such as clerical positions, carpenters, nurses and machine engineers, as well as blue-collar workers to companies in certain sectors, including construction, retail, finance, food, healthcare and construction. This segment is comprised of our Accent, Covebo, TIMEPARTNER and TMI Powerhouses, with their primary operations in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as branches in countries that form part of their international recruiting networks, which currently operate principally for this segment though we are planning to expand them for our engineering and consulting segment. These international branches provide us with the capability to source foreign candidates to bridge the large gap between the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates, ----- especially as the labor market in our Addressable Markets has tightened over the past few years. The Specialized Talent Solution segment generally delivers job candidates through temporary agencies to clients in a fast and flexible way when they are shorthanded, with duration of job placements typically lasting for weeks, but they could also last hours or months depending on the needs of our clients. The below chart illustrates in pink the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for our Specialized Talent Solution segment. We serve as an intermediary between job candidates and their ultimate employer by matching up candidates that are looking to find a job, gain experience or find variety or flexibility with our clients that are looking for specialist skills, flexible employee arrangements, time and cost efficiencies or to cover peaks or sourcing for particular projects. We source and screen candidates, provide candidate matching services and present candidates to the client. We also assist with the hiring of the candidates by customers, client and candidate retention, provide timesheet, invoicing and payroll services, and regularly follow up with clients. We aim to help our clients at all stages of the recruiting process to relieve their management from the burden of having to seek appropriate job candidates for available positions. To ensure that we are able to tap into skilled workforces, we offer career coaching to job candidates in order to help them find career paths that align with their professional goals, and we provide in-house training to equip them to match the job profiles in which they are interested or that are scarce in the market to increase job candidates’ employability. We also offer support to foreign job candidates, including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance. We enter into employment contracts with the candidates and pay their salaries. We enter into placement contracts with our clients and bill our clients for our services. Our bill-pay spread is a key driver of our profitability and supports our industry-leading gross margins. We maximize bill-pay spread as a result of candidate scarcity, our niche focus, our SME and local customer focus, our premium service offering, our excellence in marketing candidates to jobs and non-solicitation or minimum fee/period protection for candidates in respect of clients. We have strong pricing power driven by contractual dynamics that ensure pass-through of salary increases. Our specialized talent solutions segment benefits from contractual dynamics which allow for an automatic pass-through to clients of price increases, and our business model also allows for limited bench risk because staffing contracts are back-to-back. In our engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with our clients, and we effectively manage to keep our bench time low by matching confirmed upcoming client assignments to candidates. The business model of these two segments has enabled us to establish a track record of margin stability even during challenging economic conditions such as the Covid-19 pandemic and in the inflationary environment in 2022. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we generated 27.6%, 39.8%, 26.0% and 5.5% of our Pro Forma_ Management Adjusted Revenue in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, respectively. We have branches in the countries where we source job candidates, including Poland, Romania, Spain, Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal. As of September 30, 2022, we had a network of 742 branches and 18 recruitment offices. To complement our physical network of branches and reach new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies, including our SWOP application, our SWOP Recruiter application and our NOWJOBS platform. We have increased our focus on developing digital support growth initiatives for our primary operations to enable us to reach additional job candidates or serve new end-markets in a fully digital manner. ----- We support businesses by providing flexible staffing solutions that are used throughout all stages of the economic cycle, resulting in our resilience during economic downturns. While the economy is strong, the job market tightens meaning that our clients need help sourcing candidates. As markets soften, companies typically shift to a more temporary workforce and need staffing solutions and flexibility. When markets reach the bottom of the cycle, temporary staffing suffers but then is characterized by a quick recovery as temporary employment tends to recover faster than permanent employment. For example, during the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, our business recovered from the early losses in approximately three to six weeks. We also have a highly variable cost base and the ability to pass on wage inflation, which supports the stability of our gross margins. For example, our Like-for-Like Revenue growth (based on the December 31, 2021 perimeter) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 fluctuated significantly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and were 2%, (9)% and 19%, respectively, but we were able to maintain a gross margin of approximately 28% throughout this period. Flexible staffing solutions proved instrumental in the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in a full recovery of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the retail, food retail and hospitality sectors were severely impacted across all our key markets due to lockdowns and other restrictive measures, which led to a significant reduction in our staffing activities in these sectors. Certain sectors, such as logistics and education, however, proved to be less sensitive to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, and clients in these sectors continued to seek our services, particularly for high-skilled, specialized roles. In addition, demand for staffing services from municipalities and government agencies during the Covid-19 pandemic increased due to, among other developments, work related to the administration of government support measures, which we were able to capitalize on given our specialization in this end-market provided by the Cohedron Powerhouse in our engineering and consulting segment. We were founded in 1995 by Philip Cracco and Conny Vandendriessche along with a financial sponsor as a Belgium-based recruiting firm. Originally called Accent, we changed our name to House of HR in 2012. Over the course of 2012 to 2014, Naxicap, a French private equity firm, acquired a majority stake in our business, and we have expanded significantly to become a leading provider of specialized HR solutions in multiple European markets. On November 3, 2022, Bain Capital acquired a majority stake in the Group, with Naxicap, Conny Vandendriessche and management maintaining stakes. See “The _Transactions.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.1,Operating in highly resilient markets with favorable tailwinds and structural demand dynamics,"The HR solutions market has historically shown quick recovery in demand following periods of economic downturns. The general temporary staffing market, as a whole, has a long-term positive GDP growth trajectory and tends to recover quickly after an economic downturn. Within this market, specialized staffing companies, like us, also benefit from higher resiliency than generalist staffing companies that rely on the low value-add mass labor market. Specialized staffing companies benefit from lower cyclicality compared to generalist staffing companies due to specialty profiles. Specialized staffing companies also benefit from increased penetration with clients compared to generalist staffing companies due to more clients in these specialized sectors turning to staffing solutions providers like us to assist them with candidate searches and provide them with higher value-add solutions. The below graph demonstrates the relative resilience of the specialist temporary staffing companies: ----- Note: Specialists include Alten, Amadeus, Assystem, Page and Robert Half, and Generalists include Adecco, Manpower, Randstad. European Union and national regulations applicable in the key countries in which we operate tend to reinforce protection of permanent workers, which can lead companies to favor temporary work and outsourcing solutions as employers often prefer to hire on a more temporary basis before offering an employee a permanent contract. This trend is especially evident in recovery periods after a trough in the economic cycle as companies seek to scale up their workforce. For example, we were able to quickly recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with our sales fully recovering to pre-Covid 19 levels during 2021. At the same time, legislation in the countries in which we principally operate allows for multiple temporary staffing solutions, further supporting our business model. We believe that high job vacancy rates offer us strong protection from a potential downturn in the nearterm as there would still be significant numbers of unfilled positions even with a reduction in vacancies, which is similar to reductions that occurred during recent downturns. We offer our clients the ability to recruit job candidates with specific profiles for jobs that are particularly difficult to fill, including from abroad where needed, as we draw upon an international talent pool and provide required training. We operate in markets where fundamentals for businesses such as ours are improving over time, supported both by macroeconomic factors and positive structural demographic dynamics. Western Europe generally is experiencing a large, chronic and growing supply and demand gap for skilled employees, particularly related to technical engineering, specialized consulting and specialized blue-collar labor, obliging companies to look beyond traditional job candidate sourcing and seek the help of specialized staffing solutions providers like us. For example, unemployment rates in Germany were at 3.5% in 2021, as compared to 8.7% in 2007. In the Netherlands and Belgium, they were at 4.0% and 6.4%, respectively, in 2021 as compared to a recent peak of 7.4% and 8.5%, respectively, in 2014. Job vacancies in Belgium were at their highest in the second quarter of 2022 since 2012, and in Germany and the Netherlands were at their highest in the second and third quarters of 2022, respectively, since 2007. The staffing industry also benefits from a number of long-term underlying trends that have supported our industry’s historical and projected medium- to long-term growth. Demand for the types of solutions we provide is expected to continue growing in the future due to a number of positive secular trends, including: - Aging populations in our target markets and increasing competition for talent; - Technological changes to job candidates’ search for employment opportunities, including the switch to mobile technology, that are more challenging for employers to handle in-house; - Workers increasingly prioritizing career mobility and focusing on smaller, entrepreneurial opportunities; - The need for workers to train or re-skill to adapt to changing work opportunities; ----- - The desire of companies to address issues relating to diversity, inclusion and corporate social responsibility; - Workers placing an increased premium on quality of life and happiness at both a personal and professional level, and an increased preference for job flexibility, especially since the Covid19 pandemic, leading to increased job rotation; - Financial pressures resulting in increased outsourcing and offshoring; and - Increasing use of artificial intelligence, data mining and robotization, as well as technological change, all of which contribute to the skill supply-demand gap in labor markets. - Especially for freelance workers, the prospect of better economics in spite of lower job security. As a result of these secular trends, both employers and workers increasingly turn towards flexible staffing models, driving demand for extended workforce solutions. According to an external consultant analysis, in Belgium, Netherlands and France, the number of workers that are part of the extended workforce (i.e., contractors and other freelancers) has grown from 2016 to 2021 at a CAGR of 3.9%, 2.5% and 4.4%, respectively. These growth rates are above those registered in the total working population, which over the same period has grown at a CAGR of 1.0% in Belgium, 1.3% in the Netherlands and 0.4% in France. This is also evidenced by the growth in penetration of the extended workforce as part of the total workforce, with penetration rates in 2021 ranging from 7.2% in France to 10.2% in the Netherlands. We believe we are well positioned to capture penetration in specialized extended labor. These underlying trends contribute to the complexity of job searches and encourage companies to turn to staffing solutions providers like us to help them fulfill their staffing needs. In addition, they make it more challenging for new market entrants to effectively compete with established providers like us. We have strategically positioned ourselves in geographic markets that are supported by macroeconomic factors and positive demand dynamics in order to take full advantage of favorable trends. We believe that the fundamentals of our Addressable Market remain strong in the medium-term and we believe that we are poised to continue growing at or above the industry average growth rate in the future due to our business model.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.2,"Increasingly diversified exposure to resilient and profitable end-markets targeting highly loyal and less price-sensitive SME clients, with a focus on scarcity-driven specialist candidates","Our client focus is centered on SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises that require high-touch local service and operate in specialty niches that are in high demand. This focus supports our above market growth and margins and provides us resilience as a result of the critical nature of the positions sought by our clients. We believe that SMEs represent a particularly attractive client base as they are generally more loyal customers and are less price sensitive. SMEs tend to be more reliant on each employee and have lower workforce anticipation capabilities than large corporates, so the absence of a single worker can be critical. As a result, when they need to hire someone, they need someone fairly quickly and place a premium on the ability to source job candidates within their time constraints. As SMEs may have more limited or no in-house recruiting capabilities, they are more willing to outsource many of their staffing-related needs to providers like us who can provide a full service offering at all stages of the recruitment lifecycle. SMEs often have limited employer branding and therefore may experience difficulty in reaching the best job candidates without access to the talent pool of a staffing solutions provider. SMEs also often have a faster decision-making process compared to large corporates and lack purchasing departments, so we may face less pricing pressure from such companies. In addition, SMEs, due to the smaller size of their employee pools, are less likely to lay off workers in a downturn and typically maintain a more consistent level of employment than larger companies during a downturn. The stability of employee levels at SMEs was evident during the global financial crisis as, based on information from Accent, employment volumes were resilient at small companies and demonstrated growth from 2008 to 2016. ----- We have a track record of serving the attractive SME segment, with a focus on scarcity-driven specialist candidates. We believe that the ability to find a specific candidate with the right cultural fit is important for SMEs, since they typically have small teams and often seek a particular candidate who is not only qualified for the job, but also matches the client’s corporate culture. Our ability to match such job candidates results from our blend of human and digital touchpoints, with regular interaction with clients and job candidates throughout the recruitment lifecycle (including our international recruiting capabilities). HR staffing solutions also operate in a complex regulatory environment, and we provide our clients with the required specific knowledge by sector, geography and even region. We believe the ability to manage this complexity on a large scale increases the barriers to entry for the sector and diminishes the risk for digital disruption or disintermediation. In addition to our focus on SMEs, we focus on specialist candidates, which provides further resilience to our business as skilled jobs are less cyclical. For example, in France, the unemployment rate for unskilled jobs has had an approximately 8% variation between 2000 and 2020 as compared to a rate of approximately 2% for skilled workers as demonstrated by the chart below. Source: Company information, External consultant analysis, INSEE Note: Based on France. Skilled works are defined as those with two years of post-high school diploma education (baccalaureate) and unskilled workers are defined as those who hold no diploma In particular, we focus on specialty niches that are in high demand and that support higher revenue growth and margins than generalist staffing. We market our services under brands that relate to specific specialized services offered by our Powerhouses or sub business-unit or brands under a Powerhouse, which we call Boutiques. Our multiple brand approach has proven effective in attracting and retaining clients and candidates. For example, our Facebook page of Accent currently has, in most instances, almost twice the number of followers (61.0K) than the Facebook pages of our competitors Randstad Belgium (27.0K), RGF Staffing (Start People) (35.0K) or Adecco Belgium (39.0K) as of November 2022. We also benefit from having diversified our business activities towards more resilient end-markets and job candidate profiles. Our new business structure is reflective of our strategy, which is geared towards ----- moving away from general staffing to a more specialized staffing focus. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our business mix included more of a focus on general staffing, with 15% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA coming from our general staffing segment, 46% from our engineering and consulting segment and 39% from our specialized staffing segment (based on our consolidation perimeter for 2018) whereas for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) was attributable to our engineering and consulting segment and 46.5% was attributable to our specialized talent solution segment (which includes general staffing). We also have actively increased our endmarket mix to focus on public sector, IT and telecommunications, healthcare, food and financial and legal end-markets, which are more resilient throughout the economic cycle. The below chart shows our revenue for the year ended December 2018 by end-market compared to our Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue by end-market for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our focus on niche and specialty staffing highlights the added value we can provide to companies looking for specific job candidate profiles which are often difficult to find, and in our experience, clients are willing to attach a premium to such services. Our focus on niche and specialty staffing also enables us to recruit and retain qualified job candidates. Even when we serve large corporate clients, we believe our provision of specialized staffing solutions enables us to maintain pricing power as a result of the quality of and demand for our job candidates. We believe that our geographic footprint, branch density and our ability to recruit internationally are challenging to replicate and are essential to fostering the client relationships and granular geographic reach necessary to reach our targeted SME and specialty-focused clients. We maintain and have access to a large database of job candidates to enable short matching times and have acquired in-depth end ----- market experience through selective organic and external growth over many years, which facilitates our ability to source, match and retain job candidates and clients in our key markets.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

From 2008 to 2021, our Like-for-Like Revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 7.8%. We believe that our largely consistent positive Like-for-Like Revenue growth in each business segment and for the pro forma perimeter outperforms the market and evidences the success of our differentiated business model. In addition, we achieved Organic Growth of 19.9% in the year ended December 31, 2021, and 17.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our Likefor-Like Revenue growth across the various stages of the economic cycle from 2008 demonstrates the resilience of our revenues and our ability to recover from economic downturns at a more rapid rate than GDP. We have been able to maintain strong EBITDA margins even through challenging macroeconomic conditions. The chart below portrays our Like-for-Like Revenue growth from 2008 to the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 showing our organic and external growth and our EBITDA margins, including the unaudited business unit accounts of Accent, as well as those of our other business units, on the basis as described in the notes below.

We also have a strong track record of external growth through highly accretive acquisitions in a fragmented market. We approach our growth through acquisitions with rigorous discipline. We focus on acquiring successful, profitable companies rather than turn-around acquisitions. Our evaluation of a potential acquisition target includes reviewing the opportunity through the rubric of a number of stringent requirements designed to ensure fit with our overall strategy and culture. The target must fit an identified strategic need to expand our geographic coverage, complement a specific specialty or fill a niche skill gap. We also seek out targets with like-minded management teams with an entrepreneurial spirit and long-term commitment in order to ensure a strong overall cultural fit. We also evaluate the target’s profitability, historic growth and other performance metrics, and assess whether it is a leader in its addressable markets. Once we have identified and then acquired a target, we have a well-defined and proven integration process that involves consolidating the target into our Group reporting system and sharing best practices. Local management teams are given the opportunity to invest at group level or to continue to invest at the local level. We have completed 42 transactions since 2018, comprised of bolton acquisitions with lower multiples that enable growth at the local level, as well as platform acquisitions through which we expand our solutions and enter new specialties or markets. We have an excellent integration track record with our targets’ EBITDA and revenue growing by approximately 8% per annum and 10% on average after we integrated them, as demonstrated by our acquisitions of Abylsen, Covebo, Continu, TIMEPARTNER and Redmore.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.4,Reference player in target markets with proven track record of above-market performance delivering higher margins driven by highly incentivized management team,"We occupy leading positions across the highly fragmented markets in which we operate. Many of our operating companies are reference players within their respective specialty, benefiting from the virtuous cycle of competitive leadership, with their track record, enabling them to capture a high percentage of their market growth and benefiting from brand loyalty and pricing power as a result. The table below shows our relative market positioning vis-à-vis our peers: ----- Source: External consultant analysis; peer companies’ filings; Company information (1) Based on a numerical mean of revenue growth percentage of each entity. For peers based on last four to five years average, apart from local players (based on 2019 excluding Assystem), and with respect to House of HR, based on over the cycle performance. (2) For each peer, based on a numerical mean of latest publicly available EBITDA margin (post IFRS-16) as a percentage and with respect to House of HR, based on the results of operation for 2021. Based on Net Promoter Scores, we are the most recommended HR solutions provider by customers in the Netherlands and second most recommended HR solutions provider by SME customers in Belgium. In addition, based on Google reviews, we are the most recommended HR solutions provider by job candidate in Belgium and second most recommended HR solutions provider by job candidates in the Netherlands. Our clients make staffing decisions at a local level and our large footprint with high branch density allows us to be physically present in the communities where our clients operate, meaning that clients have a familiarity with our brand at a local level, which provides a key competitive advantage for us. We believe we are unique among our peers and that this is reflected in our performance compared to certain of our competitors. Our Like-for-Like Revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8% from 2008 to 2021 (based on our 2020 consolidation perimeter excluding avanti, Cohedron, SOLCOM and TMI and including Solyne and Greenworking) as compared to the Organic Growth average (weighted by business mix) of our peer benchmark, including Adecco, Randstad and Alten, which grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% during the same period. In addition, we have a track record of significant growth above market, with nominal GDP growing at annual compound growth rate of approximately 1% from 2008 to 2021 (based on the nominal GDP growth for the Eurozone) and the volume of the number of temporary workers (based on a weighted average of publicly available information in Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands) having a negative annual compound growth rate during the same period. We also enjoyed best-in-class profitability compared to our specialist and generalist peers. This is demonstrated by the below chart comparing our EBITDA margins on a total basis, for our engineering and consulting segment and for our specialized staffing solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the EBITDA margins of some of our specialist and generalist peers for the same period. ----- Source: Peer companies’ filings; Company information.

Figures for Amadeus Fire are based on the Personnel Services division excluding the Training division. 1Average is calculated as the numerical mean of percentage of EBITDA margin. We believe our above-market performance is driven by our strong entrepreneurial culture and local incentivization model. We operate on a strong incentivization model with fast promotion opportunities, including opportunities to open new branches where a manager generates new business. Our variable bonus systems are intended to encourage growth and bonuses as we do not have bonus caps. Variable pay can represent up to 50% of the salary package for our employees, including the management of our business units, branch managers, sales consultants and recruitment consultants. The below chart illustrates the potential pay for one of our account managers on a base salary of €33,000 as compared to an account manager on a base salary of €35,000 at one of our competitors, which demonstrates the additional opportunities provided by us. Source: Company information, External consultant analysis We believe our model encourages winning behaviors from our employees, driven by an owner mindset. We have highly invested top-level and mid-level managers, with 412 managers having reinvested approximately 63% of the net proceeds received from the Acquisition in the new structure, which confirms their belief in House of HR and our business model. Including new joiners, currently approximately 500 members of management are invested in the company. Such investment encourages employees to focus on building relationships, both with clients and candidates, which helps to support our performance. We also typically offer an appealing value proposition to managers of the businesses we acquire by allowing these individuals to retain autonomy over their respective entities’ operations, including brand and identity, while allowing them to benefit from central support on complex regulatory and compliance topics, access to our foreign sourcing network and digital platforms and access to our financing. We also offer such managers an incentive structure tied to, where possible, both their own company’s and our overall results. We believe that this streamlines the integration process and helps to align the management of our acquisition targets with our central management. Together with the support of our new sponsor, Bain Capital, we replaced our long-term incentive plan, which was settled on or about the Acquisition Closing Date, with a new one on the Acquisition Closing Date in order to maintain our culture of incentivization and increase employee commitment and engagement. We also believe that our long-term incentive plan allows for succession planning for key roles by incentivizing key staff ----- to remain with the business and by enabling potential reinvestments in the equity of House of HR going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.5,"Ability to pass through wage increases to customers, including through automatic contractual mechanisms, and stable margins","We have the ability to pass through wage increases from inflation to customers in both our engineering and consulting segment and our specialized talent solutions segment, which, coupled with our flexible cost structure, has resulted in resilient gross margins. While our gross margins in both of our segments fluctuate somewhat as a result of seasonality around holiday periods, they have remained largely stable since January 2019 at approximately 22% to 28% (depending on Powerhouses and specialties) for our specialized talent solutions segment and approximately 30% to 37% for our engineering and consulting segment. Our revenues typically correlate with nominal GDP rather than real GDP due to our ability to pass through wage increases in an inflationary environment and stable margins. In our specialized talent solutions segment, price increases are automatically passed through to our clients. For this segment, our contract model is centered on matching the length of our candidate’s employment contract with us to the length of our placement contract with our client, the ultimate employer, in order to prevent lag time between inflation of gross salary paid to the candidate and the cost we charge to our clients, which results in an automatic pass-through of any salary increases. As contracts expire, we renegotiate them, which has historically resulted in an ability to increase our prices in line with wage inflation. We base our contract pricing on a candidate’s gross salary multiplied by a coefficient factor, with the split typically being transparent to the client. Our coefficient factors tend to remain relatively stable with slight fluctuations as a result of seasonality around holiday periods. For example, Accent’s coefficient factor has remained relatively stable since 2020 at an average of 2.2. The key pricing drivers for the coefficient factor are the scarcity of candidates and the value of any additional services we offer. Key costs for us include salaries and work accident insurance. At the end of the contract period, typically one week or one month in length, if salary increases, then we charge the cost of the higher salary to the client. During the first half of 2022, we achieved average price increases of approximately 5.0% (calculated as the numerical mean of the average price increases across certain Powerhouses, weighted equally). Growth in euro-per-hour billed in our specialized talent solutions segment is driven by increasing cost per hour paid and billed, as well as through increasing bench costs. Our gross margin per hour billed remained highly stable at approximately 23% to 25% (including bench costs) and approximately 29% to 30% (excluding bench costs) for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as shown in the below chart. Source: Company information, External consultant analysis Note: GM0 = Gross Margin on billed hours only (excl. bench costs); GM = Gross Margin (incl. bench costs / unbilled hours). Difference between GM0 and GM is bench cost. Bench costs include paid sickness and paid holiday. 1 Excluding Atrium and BE-Consult given ongoing integration. ----- In our engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with clients. The contracts are typically time and material contracts with no obligations for any specific result. Most of our candidates in our engineering and consulting segment are permanently hired by us using employment contracts that typically have three- to six-week notice periods. We have placement contracts with our clients that typically last nine to twelve months, which allows us to effectively manage bench time and match our candidates with the upcoming mandates from clients. In most cases, we plan for salary increases in advance and negotiate rate increases with our clients accordingly. Our pricing model in our engineering and consulting segment centers on charging the client an hourly or daily rate. Our billing rate is typically based on an hourly wage and a mark-up where the split is usually not transparent to clients. Since 2021, we have been able to consistently increase our hourly rate in this segment. For example, at Talent&Pro, one of our Redmore Boutiques that focuses on the finance industry staffing, although our hourly rate fluctuated between €46.8 and €48.1 per hour during the course of 2020, by the end of December 2021 we were able to increase it to approximately €49.6, and have continued to increase it during the course of 2022, with an hourly rate of €53.5 as of September 2022. Key drivers of the hourly or daily rates are skills, seniority and scarcity of candidates. Our key costs include salary, potentially including a company car. At the end of a placement contract, renewal either entails replacing the candidate with a new or more junior person at a new price or placing the same candidate, who is now more senior, at a higher price. During the first half of 2022, we achieved average price increases of approximately 6.6% (calculated as the numerical mean of the average price increases across certain Powerhouses, weighted equally). Margin growth in our engineering and consulting segment is driven by increasing the cost per hour paid and billed. Bench-time risk is effectively managed by matching confirmed upcoming client assignments to candidates. Our gross margin per hour billed in this segment also remained stable at approximately 32% to 34% (including bench costs) and approximately 45% to 47% (excluding bench costs) for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.6,Robust financial profile supports cash generation with a highly variable cost base and proven ability to deleverage,"Our business model has supported strong EBITDA growth and profitability. We demonstrated our financial resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic with strong EBITDA margins of 11%, 10% and 12% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and 11% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. We have limited capital expenditure requirements (primarily related ----- to IT investments and expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, primarily related to our headquarters, furniture and infrastructure for our branch network, accommodation for foreign job candidates, company cars) of approximately 1% of revenue in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. As our key assets are the talent we provide to meet the temporary staffing needs of our clients, we have limited fixed assets or cash tied up in inventory. Working capital largely consists of receivables (client billings) and payables (job candidate wages, social security, etc.) tied to individual job candidate placements. The receivable for each job candidate placement is typically higher than the payable with the difference roughly representing the bill-pay spread or gross margin embedded in the client service agreement and job candidate agreement. Working capital as a percentage of sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, was 4.9% of sales, compared to 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The working capital dynamics and corresponding downside protection for our cash flows are also evident in our recent performance. As volumes of job candidates reduce, for instance, during period of economic downturns, we benefit from significant working capital inflows, which gives us strong cash resiliency. In 2020, we experienced a positive change in working capital demonstrating the counter-cyclical nature of our working capital profile. As a result, we experience high cash conversion and cash flow growth, which has, in turn, supported our business growth, and has in the past, allowed us to deleverage on a net debt basis following each of our refinancings. The following chart shows our Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow and our Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow as a percentage of EBITDA cash for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. We also benefit from a flexible cost structure, with approximately 95% of our costs being variable or semi-variable allowing for highly stable gross margins through the cycle. For 2021, approximately 65.1% of our total operating expenses were variable, 31.7% were semi-variable and 3.2% were fixed costs. Our cost of services, which represented 79.1% of our total operational expenses (cost of services and operating expenses together) for the year ended December 31, 2021, is comprised of mostly variable costs related to our people at work (mainly payroll, social security contributions, housing, car fleet and subcontracting costs). Our direct costs linked to our branches are primarily semi-variable and include staff costs, including costs of managers and recruiters, and branch expenses, such as rents, car leases and training, marketing and communication costs. Our overheads related to corporate functions at both an operating company and Group-level, which represented less than 5% of our total operating expenses, consists primarily of fixed costs. Further, due to our back-to-back contract model, we experience limited bench risk in respect of people at work. In many of our jurisdictions, we are able to match the duration of the employment of our job candidates and their placement, allowing us to be flexible in the deployment of our job candidate resources. As costs generally track revenue, costs of service as a percentage of revenue, and as a result, our margins, generally remain stable during downturns, as demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.7,We are well-protected from disruption by other digital players and have developed an emerging platform for excellent proprietary digital offering,"We have an excellent proprietary digital offering and based on interviews with market participants we believe we are well-protected from disruption from typical digital players that focus on a low-skilled, higher volume business. We believe we are differentiated from such market participants because our core offering is focused on specialty staffing and focused on SMEs that require customized services, which are much more difficult to standardize or automate. We believe that we are a thought leader and ahead of our larger peers in many respects as a result of our development of digital initiatives in order to both address new markets with innovative business models and improve our own and existing operations. To complement our physical network of branches and reach new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies that are revenuegenerating. Our NOWJOBS platform, which successfully competes in the low-skill, higher volume segment, is primarily geared to students and other seekers of one-off temporary jobs, and is to date our most successful digital initiative. Originally just available in Belgium where it launched in 2017, we launched NOWJOBS in the Netherlands in 2019, in France in 2021 and in Germany in June 2022, bringing on board big customers such as retail brands H&M and Picnic. For the year ended December 31, 2021, NOWJOBS handled approximately 1.1 billion requests and generated €54.1 million, €1.9 million and €0.2 million in revenues in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, respectively. Following our acquisition of StaffMe in July 2022, NOWJOBS will operate under the StaffMe brand in France given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country. In addition, we launched our SWOP Recruiter application in May 2021, which is a free digital platform that helps Belgian SMEs with the day-to-day management of their vacancies. The application is linked to our SWOP application, which we launched in 2016 and further upgraded in 2020, and is now one of the largest Belgian apps to help job seekers find a new permanent job. We launched SWOP in the Netherlands in October 2022 and plan to launch SWOP in Germany in the near future. Our Gighouse app is a digital platform that matches freelancers and independent job candidates with available projects at our customers. We aim to leverage our experience as a disruptor in the market to expand successful initiatives to our broader Group. In addition, we have also developed a number of complementary digital offerings that supplement our core services. For example, in June 2019, we launched our MyAccent app, which allows potential job candidates to interact via the Google Home assistant with Accent’s list of open positions. Book’u is our planning tool, allowing customers to plan both their permanent and temporary workforce in one solution, being in touch with this workforce to communicate when they should be available and allowing to spot potential staffing shortages, immediately posting these shortages at their staffing companies of choice. My Talents (Softskillz) testing has been developed together with the University of Ghent, to test ‘who you are’ as a person and to test ‘what type of company do I want to work for.’ These tests will allow for better AI matching of jobs with candidates. Continu-Connect, which launched in 2021 and had 756 registered contacts as of December 31, 2021, shows all available candidates in a region for our customers. Our FYGI app brings together freelance HR recruiters with companies that have a recruitment request. We have also other apps and platforms that assist with the recruitment and other staffing processes, such as Dora, Ariad and CV Creator. All apps are developed taking into account reusability across all House of HR operating companies, benefitting therefore from the economies of scale House of HR has versus local competitors and increasing the barriers to entry for our industry. During 2021, we centralized all our digital assets in House of Invest, creating one platform to meet current needs and invest in new needs as they arise. This enabled us to further invest in our digital roadmap and internationalize our digital initiatives, bringing our digital and IT talents together to work on multiple digital solutions. The main purpose of House of Invest is to roll out the digital initiatives across all House of HR Powerhouses and Boutiques and to capitalize on a centralized knowledge base. House of Invest now owns NOWJOBS, Gighouse, SWOP and SWOP Recruiter, Continu-Connect, CV creator and My Talents (Softskillz), and holds minority ownerships in Dora and Ariad (a traditional digital marketing staffing company) and a majority ownership in Book’u. ----- For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from digital solutions amounted to 2.6% of total revenue, compared to 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have continued investing in IT in 2022 and expect to continue prioritizing the digital venue going forward. We believe our digital offering protects us from disruptions from digital players who focus on low-skilled, high volume business, while our platforms continue to focus on high-skilled job candidates with a focus on SMEs. We are also continuing to innovate our existing processes by identifying areas within our business that could benefit from increased automation and zero-paper processes, including both job candidate- and client-facing and internal processes, such as finance, procurement and marketing and communications. Further, we continue to digitalize our processes and create a centralized repository designed to store, process and secure large amounts of data across our different applications, which will enhance our access to job candidates and improve our matching capabilities. We believe the efficiencies we can realize through this digitalization will produce cost savings while allowing us to meet the everincreasing demands of clients and job candidates.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.8,"Entrepreneurial and invested management team with long-term incentive culture backed by a new, highly supportive shareholder with deep industry knowledge","We benefit from a strong and committed management team that is highly motivated to deliver strong performance over the long term. We believe our successful organic and external growth has been due in part to the way in which we have been able to incentivize our managers. For example, our organic “cell division” expansion strategy rewards our local managers with the opportunity to create and run individual branches, fostering loyalty and encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit that has delivered our success to date. For our engineering and consulting branches, our variable pay structure rewards management down to the sales and recruitment consultants with variable pay linked to key performance indicators such as attracting, matching and retaining job candidates and clients. While keeping a highly entrepreneurial culture at the Powerhouse and Boutique levels, all strategic decisions with a significant impact are made at House of HR level, and our local business units share in the centralized corporate support and institutional knowledge. We now also benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our new shareholder, Bain Capital. Bain Capital has a strong track record of investing in the business services space with over 50 current or past investments. Bain Capital has invested in businesses in the staffing and engineering consulting services, including Quest, a leading global engineering services provider, MSX International, a BPO company focused on technical staffing solutions and managed services, Inetum, an IT services provider in France, and Engineering, an IT systems and services provider in Italy, as well as other investments in the business services space, including Autodistribution and Bravida. Following the Acquisition, our management continues to remain invested in the equity of the Group, having reinvested approximately 63% of the net proceeds received from the Acquisition in the Group, totaling approximately €255.0 million, or between 20% to 25% of ownership of the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

In most of our markets, we expect to continue our strategy of embedding ourselves in local communities through an extensive branch network. While our primary operations are in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, we have branches spread across countries where we source job candidates. Our international recruiting network is key for our ability to attract and retain job candidates for assignments in sectors where candidates are scarce. Our decentralized structure places our Powerhouses and Boutiques in proximity to our primary stakeholders: ----- our clients, our job candidates and our own employees, which allows us to gain local market knowledge, understand local competition and remain informed of local staffing trends. In order to continue to grow, we intend to expand our branch network where needed and to continue to leverage our success in sourcing and retaining job candidates, focusing on those job profiles which are and will be increasingly scarce in the market. We also believe our extensive branch network approach leads to enhanced entrepreneurship and ownership due to the managerial responsibilities and opportunities allocated or available to branch managers, reinforcing a key part of our values. We also intend to continue to focus on, and leverage our positive track record in, our engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions segments to continue growing profitably. We have gradually shifted our focus toward the engineering and consulting and specialized staffing model and away from general staffing, benefiting from our growing network in the transition to deliver higher margins. The specialized staffing and engineering and consulting segments tend to deliver higher margins than general staffing due to the premium clients place on successful placement of the specific job candidates that they seek. Specialization in turn aims to target those segments and skills that are more difficult to find for our customers, which in the past has provided more stability to our revenue figures and protected our margins, including during economic downturns. We further aim to deliver continued improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin through efficient cost control over operating expense and strong cash conversion with rigorous management of capital expenditures and working capital. We believe our agile organization and increased specialization will continue to promote flexibility for our Powerhouses and Boutiques to refine recruitment approaches and conduct day-to-day activities that best meet their respective local business needs and enable us to offer clients tailored staffing services. We believe this will continue to translate into higher market penetration and additional market share to propel our organic growth, as well as our ability to effectively staff specialized jobs that drive our bestin-class profitability given the scarcity and complexity of the job profiles we match.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

We believe that in the future these clients, in both our engineering and consulting segment and specialized talent solutions segment, will continue to require the assistance of providers like us primarily for temporary HR solutions as they grapple with limited resources, lower visibility on staffing needs and greater need for outsourced HR functions, including as a result of the complexity of labor law and associated regulations. As the partner of choice for our SMEs and locally managed clients, we are experienced in accommodating unique and time-sensitive client demands, including matching specialized, “mission-critical” profiles for our clients in the engineering and consulting segment that typically last for months, or deploying a large number of blue-collar workers at short notice for our clients in the specialized talent solutions segment that often last for weeks or sometimes just hours as the situations require. We plan to continue focusing on being the partner of choice for SMEs and locally managed clients by leveraging the large pool of potential job candidates at our disposal and the deep end-market knowledge we have gathered over the years by having boots on the ground in proximity to our clients.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.14,Our Strategies,18.14.3,Ensure the smooth and profitable placement of job candidates with a reliable sourcing and reskilling platform,"Mastering the “human” aspect of human resources is key to success in our industry, and we intend to continue to be a leader through our focus on being able to source the right job candidate for the right position, including through offering reskilling services. We believe that our network of international sourcing of job candidates is vital to our success, as we are better able to bridge the large gap between the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates, especially as the labor market in our Addressable Market has tightened over the past few years, through having access to a wider pool of quality job candidates than our peers. The location of our agencies (particularly in Poland, Romania, Spain, the Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal) and the support we offer to foreign job candidates ----- (including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance) ensures that we are able to tap into workforces that are skilled but that are eager to seek out opportunities to earn higher wages than those that similar work would provide in their home countries. We intend to continue to develop our network in other countries that meet these criteria. We also plan to continue leveraging our large sourcing network to target the best job candidates and provide them with a wide array of positions and support, including in-house training that equips them with skillsets that match the profiles that our clients look for, administrative support, client knowledge and even transport and housing for foreign job candidates to make their experience as smooth as possible. Finally, we plan to focus on preparing job candidates for what we see as the jobs of tomorrow, such as white-collar positions in big data and information technology, that are being driven by the digitalization of the economy or provide training in order to teach blue-collar job candidates how to use digital tools.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.14,Our Strategies,18.14.4,Utilize digital initiatives to reduce cost and drive revenue diversification,"Our digital strategy is focused on maximizing the impact of digital cost reduction initiatives, outpacing smaller competitors who have more limited investment capabilities and opening new market segments. In the near-term, we want to leverage digital tools to complement our physical networks to attract job candidates and clients while also spreading awareness of our brands and services. We also intend to continue digitalizing our processes to drive efficiency. For example, SWOP, our free digital sourcing platform that assists SMEs with day-to-day management of their vacancies, strengthens our sourcing capability and supplements the activities of our revenue-generating business units, such as NOWJOBS, which facilitates the actual matching of job candidates with clients. Over the longer term, we intend to pursue a four-pillared digital strategy. First, we aim to reposition the offices we have in urban areas into “JobShops” that are easy to reach, convenient, one-stop shops where job candidates can be tested, get certifications and be matched with potential positions through our digital platforms that require limited involvement of our recruiting consultants. We also are continuing to develop niche, specialized digital platforms that are tailored to meet the specific demands of the various markets we address. Furthermore, we intend to utilize the data that we have generated through our large network to deliver the best possible client and job candidate service through our candidate data platform. For example, we are currently developing Mission Akira, a data-driven tool that helps to train our consultants on the kind of information that they should ask candidates for in order to better prepare them for placement. We are also developing a client version of the ‘Who do I want to work for’ test, which indicates the type of job candidates that fit best with a particular team leader, and the ‘My brains’ test which attempts to indicate the intelligence level of a job candidate within their education level. We also plan to develop more automated processes to free up our recruiting consultants’ time for them to focus on growing ever closer to our client and job candidate base and gather the right information that will lead to faster and better matching. As part of our digital strategy, we are in the process of rolling out our digital platforms internationally to enable us to get more structured and accurate information from job candidates, so we can match them with the right clients in a more effective and flexible manner, which we believe will help introduce brand loyalty and help us with client and job candidates retention. For example, NOWJOBS was first launched in Belgium in 2017, and it was subsequently launched in the Netherlands in 2019, in France in 2021 and most recently in Germany in 2022. We also acquired StaffMe in July 2022, a French digital platform focusing on student employment and which is primarily active in the retail, health event and hospitality sectors, supplementing our NOWJOBS offering. Through this acquisition, we also acquired the other companies of the StaffMe group, including the StaffMe Academy, the first training organization for young entrepreneurs, and the Accelerator, a program of integration through selfemployment for those who are far from employment. NOWJOBS will operate under the StaffMe brand in France given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country.

We do not consider acquisition opportunities aimed at turning around a business, but only will consider opportunities that can reinforce our market positions or expand our footprint, either in new geographical regions or niche areas in which we currently are not present and that exhibit the following attributes: stable economies with low unemployment, high salary level, high temporary staff penetration, a stable regulatory environment and supply and demand mismatch for skilled labor. We will continue to focus on acquisitions of highly specialized businesses (such as IT, legal and finance), business focusing on bottleneck jobs and engineering and consulting services. We will also consider opportunities in digital tools that can improve the value chain or allow us to better serve job candidates as well as clients and to develop new and complementary segments that are also marked by labor market scarcity or that can demonstrate the prospect for high growth and superior margins. We will continue to use our M&A assessment criteria, which requires that any opportunity meets our own high quality standards, holds a leading position in its respective specialized end-market, reflects a strong financial profile and represents a good cultural fit with us. While we historically have focused on bolt-on acquisitions that can enhance our network and/or provide us with exposure to complementary sectors of the economy, we also occasionally consider larger acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our investment criteria. We are also targeting, in particular, certain new end-markets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals and new geographic markets such as the Nordic countries and other countries, such as Austria and Switzerland.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

We acquired Logi-technic in 2009 and Bekaert Technics in 2010, expanding our operations within Belgium. Over the course of 2012 to 2014, Naxicap, a French private equity firm, acquired a majority stake in our business, and we have expanded significantly to become a leading provider of specialized HR solutions in multiple European markets. Our business made its first cross-border acquisition in March 2015, acquiring the French staffing firm Abylsen, which became one of our Powerhouses and seconds engineers through multiple offices across France, Belgium and Switzerland. From 2015, our expansion accelerated through Organic Growth and through acquisitions, starting with two other major acquisitions in 2015, which have since become Powerhouses: Covebo, a Dutch specialized temporary staffing company sourcing Polish workers through a network in Poland and the Netherlands, and Continu Professionals, a Dutch professional staffing company seconding white-collar technical professionals in the construction, civil and industrial engineering end-markets. We have since acquired firms that have become other Powerhouses of our Group, such as Redmore, GRITT, TIMEPARTNER, Cohedron, SOLCOM and TMI. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition _and Results of Operations—Acquisitions, Disposals and the Comparability of our Financial Statements” for further information on our acquisitions._ In 2018, we implemented a legal reorganization which was completed in January 2019, as a result of which our holding companies, House of HR NV and The House of Pledge NV, hold 100% of the equity interests in each of the top entities associated with the Group’s ten Powerhouses (except for Abylsen, which is held by Accent). We had historically structured our business across three segments: engineering and consulting, specialized staffing and general staffing. In 2021, we integrated our legacy specialized staffing and general staffing segments into the current specialized talent solutions segment, and we now categorize our ten Powerhouses into one of the two staffing segments: engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions, which are also the Group’s financial reporting segments. ----- On May 28, 2022, Bain Capital entered into the Acquisition Agreement to acquire a majority stake in the Group.

Our in-house employees match job candidates to the HR needs of our clients. Some of our business units also screen and recruit freelancers, particularly in specialist areas with high job shortages or where flexible work arrangements are preferred, and certain of our business units also engage in search and selection services in order to recruit highly specialized job candidates. We refer to “job candidates” as those individuals that we recruit or who come to us seeking work and who are placed with clients.

We source job candidates through databases, our presence at schools, universities and on job boards, our digital initiatives such as SWOP, as well as through training for the skilling or reskilling of job candidates. We also make use of foreign recruiting networks in certain of our Powerhouses, such as Accent, Covebo, Redmore and TIMEPARTNER. - **_Assessing:_** We assess job candidates by checking their education and skills (with additional assessment for more specialized roles) and certify their capabilities. - **_Matching: To match job candidates to clients’ opportunities, we check their fit with the job position and company, including their mobility and availability for the location and duration of the assignment. We then match a job candidate to a client and seek to ensure the job candidate has a good understanding of the job and its requirements. All our digital initiatives aim to improve data quality, which will lead to improved matching capabilities and results. For our digital tools, such as SWOP and NOWJOBS, matching is all digitalized to the extent possible to make the process more effective and efficient. We are also leveraging other different matching engines to improve matching results based on specific criteria. In addition, we are currently working to develop a candidate data platform (“CDP”) to further improve data quality and management of job candidate information. - **_Administrative management: We prepare the contract with the job candidate, whose terms may vary based on the Powerhouse and the type of placement with which the job candidate is matched, and we provide other administrative support throughout the assignment, including, for example, the monitoring and management of vacation day requests and job candidate payments, as well as the observation of sector agreements to ensure they are respected. We also prepare the customer contracts and ensure all required information to commence the job is shared with both the client and job candidate. We also follow up to ensure smooth contract signatures are obtained initially and then upon renewal, if desired. - **_On-boarding: We present the job candidate to the client, guiding him/her through interviews. We also follow up with job candidates in certain placements, such as within the engineering and consulting segment, after candidates are placed in order to check their satisfaction with the client and the assignment, whether the matching was accurate and to further understand any ----- further wishes or objectives of the job candidate. Job candidates, especially in the engineering and consulting segment, are also trained to fit certain job or project-specific tasks. - **_Payroll and payments: We use digital timesheets and validate the timesheets, to facilitate the correct payment of job candidates’ salaries. For our specialized talent solutions segment, payments are generally made on a weekly or bi-weekly basis (but it is possible in some instances on a daily basis), and client invoicing is done on a weekly basis.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Our digital initiatives, such as Gighouse and NOWJOBS automatically match job candidates to clients, though we often monitor our digital initiatives in order to facilitate the matching and engage with the job candidates and clients when needed. - **_Administrative management: We prepare the service agreement between ourselves and the client. - **_Invoicing and payments: We use timesheets and validate those timesheets to provide correct and transparent invoicing to clients and correct salary payments to job candidates, with certain of our staffing solutions utilizing digital timesheets. We can also manage the different legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate for clients, including the payment of payroll taxes and other withholdings. - **_After-sales: We follow up with clients after on-boarding job candidates to check if the matching was accurate and to assess the client’s satisfaction with the job candidate and the recruiting process.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

We believe that best practice for job candidate sourcing from international markets is managed through foreign recruiting-dedicated teams in local foreign offices which are joined up with foreign recruiting teams in host countries to identify clients with long-outstanding vacancies. A foreign recruiting team with a presence in both countries can then offer a full-service proposition to the customer covering all steps from sourcing and recruiting to on-boarding and payroll. We also believe Covebo and Accent, and since 2019, TIMEPARTNER, reflect best practices by having job candidate integration teams in the host countries that are dedicated to placing and monitoring foreign workers, providing in-house training and offering other comprehensive services to assist with their integration (support in finding housing, health, transport, tax assistance and possibly host country language support). Covebo is also available as an app, allowing job candidates to access its services on mobile devices. We also utilize some digital tools to recruit in foreign countries, such as Dora in Romania, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, the UK, Poland, Portugal, Bulgaria and Lithuania. Dora is a chatbot, or a computer program designed to ask pre-set questions to screen job candidates before engaging them with our live recruiters. Dora can be deployed through Facebook, Instagram and other ----- social media platforms, targeting job candidates looking for job vacancies, and is available in Polish, Romanian and English.

Through these Powerhouses, each segment typically focuses on particular specialties to varying degrees, provides certain types of job candidates to meet clients’ needs, and takes various approaches to employment terms and placement duration. A depiction of the typical approach, employment terms and average placement duration of assignments at the Group’s staffing segment is laid out below: We believe our “cell division” expansion strategy, which focuses on securing new sales before committing to additional costs, is a key driver of organic growth for our specialized talent solutions segment. We hire additional sales personnel at an existing branch to focus on developing opportunities out of our existing offices as commercial activity increases over time as we identify clear expansion opportunities. A new, dedicated commercial manager is appointed and given an agreed period of time ----- in order to acquire new clients or a new customer segment in a prospective area. Once these new clients have been secured and adequate revenue has been generated, the commercial manager opens a new office to handle such clients and becomes an office manager hiring their own staff. This strategy has allowed us to continually strengthen our geographic breadth and depth without pursuing acquisitions and with minimal risk, thereby driving our organic growth. We also believe that our variable compensation model, which rewards recruiters, sales consultants and office managers at our branches for finding, matching and retaining job candidates, also drives our organic growth, particularly for our engineering and consulting segment.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

For most of our Powerhouses, having branches close to our clients and job candidates is important to being able to find and match job candidates. As a result, our Powerhouses typically have a number of existing branches spread throughout the applicable geographic regions and focus on building scale and density by opening new branches throughout these areas in order to be closer to job candidates and clients. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France represented approximately 23.4%, 50.2%, 15.1% and 11.3%, respectively, of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA.

Abylsen operates in a competitive but fragmented market, where it is a relatively small company which challenges primarily large global consulting or mid-sized global companies or brands, as well as regional companies or brands. _End-markets served and contract framework_ We provide engineering and technology consulting services to clients, with the majority of sales revenue from clients being from blue-chip or larger medium-sized companies. We also have a strong focus on SME clients. In terms of end-market, Abylsen is a multi-specialist Powerhouse providing engineering graduates to a wide range of end-markets. The largest end-markets served by Abylsen’s engineers are energy, industry, telecommunications and pharmaceutical, though we also served a number of clients in automotive, transport, aeronautics and defense and IT. Abylsen also serves these industries via its Boutiques Pharmacos, Pharma Insights, Belgatech, Mykelson, Greenworking and ETA. _Types of clients and job candidates_ Abylsen has a strong focus on balancing talent hiring and retention with wage control and turnover. Furthermore, it uses engineers to recruit and match engineering job candidates to clients and to provide in-house employees with end-market and job specialization and understanding. The service agreements Abylsen enters into with clients will vary from client to client depending on their end-market and staffing needs. For example, Abylsen also provided one of our clients, a leading pharmaceuticals company, with a team to monitor the remediation of emergency lighting defects across their expansive facilities. _Financial performance and other operating metrics_ Since its acquisition in March 2015, Abylsen’s EBITDA has grown from €17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to €20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA growth of 2.4% per annum, and its revenue has grown from €75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to €124.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with a revenue growth of 8.6% per annum. As of September 30, 2022, Abylsen had 45 branches, 480 in house full time equivalent employees and 2,151 qualified specialists at work with different expertise (including mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering). For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Abylsen had _Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue of €206.2 million. The substantial majority of Abylsen’s_ revenue is generated in France, with the remainder of sales primarily being generated in Belgium.

We typically provide consulting and secondment services to clients through job candidates with university degrees or applied university degrees who are predominantly but not exclusively on indefinite term contracts with us. Redmore and its Boutiques operate primarily in the banking and insurance sectors, and also for governments and companies seeking financial staffing in enterprise recourse planning (“ERP”) implementation, with competitors of a variety of sizes, including large global companies and the “Big Four” accountancy firms. Redmore has five complementary brands: Talent&Pro, Triple A - Risk Finance, Profource, ITDS and Vialegis: - **_Talent&Pro focuses on secondment of its own job candidates for the Dutch financial end- market who are either on indefinite term contracts with us, temporary personnel or freelancers (whom we have screened and assessed); - **_Triple A - Risk Finance_** provides consulting services in the area of actuary and risk management services and job candidates placed by Triple A - Risk Finance ordinarily have actuarial and risk managements backgrounds; - **_Profource provides secondment and consulting services through our job candidates who are specialized in optimizing finance processes, the execution of enterprise resource planningrelated assignments and business processes outsourcing; - **_ITDS provides specialist consulting for insurance companies, pension funds and banks; and - **_Vialegis provides legal staffing solutions, including search and selection services, with a focus on highly skilled white-collar job candidates primarily to the largest law firms in Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany. Vialegis also offers, mainly in Belgium, interim legal counsels to large corporates, for interim legal services and projects. Vialegis was one of our Powerhouses in the engineering and consulting segment, but was sold to Redmore on September 30, 2021 and has since been operating as part of Redmore and is no longer a separate platform. _End-markets served and contract framework_ While the majority of Redmore’s revenue comes from large corporates, SMEs and intermediate sized enterprises also contribute a significant portion of its overall revenue. In terms end-market, Redmore is a specialist Powerhouse providing financial consulting services to end-markets including insurance, banking, government and health, as well as to other corporates. Redmore, through its five Boutiques, is primarily engaged on time and material contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 92.5% by revenue of the contracts for the Boutiques under Redmore were time and material contracts. Based on our periodic assessment of our contracts, we estimate that a typical service agreement between these brands and a client will be a time and materials contract for an average duration of six to ten months. Furthermore, our job candidates in Redmore are typically employees on our payroll with an indefinite contract, meaning that bench time may occur. As a result, this is a metric which is carefully monitored. Redmore also monitors the chargeability of its job candidates since a number of its job candidates, primarily in its consulting services, will be engaged periodically on non-chargeable activities such as training or pre-sale activities, which are expected to benefit the Powerhouse’s sales in the long-run, but will result in periods where job candidates are not generating revenue for the Powerhouse. Redmore’s revenue also stems from various other sources, including fees relating to business process outsourcing for certain banks and insurance companies performed via its service center in Utrecht, search and selection fees generated by Vialegis and Ctrl-F for permanent placement at clients and fees relating to freelance placement. _Types of clients and job candidates_ ----- Redmore has a strong focus on training, coaching and evaluating its job candidates and placing them in assignments that develop their skills through experience. We typically recruit young professionals and provide training to them from day one and over their years of employment with us as job candidates to develop their financial expertise. The Powerhouse also offers an in-house academy with certifications and qualifications, knowledge and competency frameworks to attract and retain job candidates and to develop them with increasing market value for its clients. For many of the assignments for which our Powerhouses’ job candidates are eligible, their market value (the bill value we can charge), increases more quickly than the salary requirements (the payment we make to job candidates), which contributes to the bill-pay spread and our Group’s profitability. The service agreements that each of the brands under Redmore enters into with clients will vary from client to client depending on a number of factors including their end-market and staffing needs. Examples of service agreements entered into by each of Redmore’s brands are provided below: - Talent&Pro provided a team of job candidates, comprising of a mix of junior and senior job candidates, to one of our clients, a Dutch bank, to fulfil their need for compliance professionals for a Customer Due Diligence Enhancement project involving approximately 30,000 KnowYour-Customer files related to SMEs. Talent&Pro designed and ran this project through an outsourcing solution, including management, quality control and reporting. Talent&Pro placed 52 consultants through 2020 and 2021. This agreement generated a total revenue of €3.1 million, of which €2.8 million was generated in 2021. - Profource was asked by one of its clients, a global e-commerce company, to implement and rollout a new HR application, the Oracle HCM Cloud Time & Labor and Absence Management, in 21 countries. Profource provided a team of eleven consultants and project managers to successfully deliver this project, which generated a total revenue of approximately €0.4 million in 2021. - ITDS was asked by one of its clients, a term life insurance company, to assist with the selection and implementation of a new core administrative system. In 2021, we placed four consultants on this project, and this service agreement is expected to run until the end of 2023 and generate a total revenue of approximately €2.0 million, of which we invoiced €0.2 million in 2021 and €0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. - Triple A - Risk Finance was selected by several insurance companies to help implement IFRS 17. At four major Dutch insurance companies, Triple A - Risk Finance placed 31 job candidates at each company in 2021. These projects together generated a total revenue of €4.6 million. - Vialegis, at the request of one of its longstanding clients, an independent Belgian law firm, searched and successfully recruited a team of lawyers consisting of three partners and seven associates to join the client from another independent law firm. This placement generated a one-off fee of €0.1 million. _Financial performance and other operating metrics_ Since its acquisition in December 2017, Redmore’s EBITDA has grown from €20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA growth of 15.3% per annum, and its revenue has grown from €108.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €138.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with a revenue growth of 6.6% per annum. As of September 30, 2022, Redmore had 20 offices, with 246 in-house full-time equivalent employees and 2,040 job candidates at work. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Redmore had revenues of €211.3 million. Nearly all of Redmore’s revenue is generated in the Netherlands.

It is headquartered in the Netherlands, with branches throughout the Netherlands, two branches in Belgium and a branch in Germany that was opened at the beginning of 2019. Continu Professionals provides secondment solutions to clients through job candidates who are planners, foremen, superintendents, technical designers, project managers, architects and a wide variety of engineers such as in manufacturing, infrastructure and construction (including specialization in social housing corporations) research and development, and mechanical. _End-markets served and contract framework_ The substantial majority of sales revenue from clients comes from SME and intermediate sized enterprises. In terms of end-markets, Continu Professionals was a mono-specialist Powerhouse providing secondment services towards the construction end-market, but has been diversifying its services to include the industrial, civil and mechanical engineering end-markets. It has also increased its specialization within the construction end-market through its acquisition of mténv, which is focused on social housing corporations, as well as with the acquisitions of TechMatch in January 2020 and Solyne in January 2021, both generally on technical profiles, with Solyne focusing primarily on public infrastructure projects. Continu Professionals is primarily engaged on time and material contracts, with a focus on assignments that provide opportunities for temporary placements to lead to permanent positions, or “temp-to-perm.” Continu Professionals’ exposure to bench time is limited due to its use of back-to-back contracts (meaning a contract is entered into between us and the job candidate in connection with a secondment or other staffing assignment with a client for the same duration) and short notice periods towards seconded job candidates. Furthermore, since 2016, Continu Professionals has been a member of the Algemene Bond Uitzendondernemeningen (the “ABU”), which means the applicable CLA is the ABU CLA. This allows Continu Professionals to enter into multiple consecutive temporary contracts within five years with an employee (as opposed to three under provisions applicable to it before joining the ABU) and has also allowed Continu Professionals to offer longer duration contracts. See “Regulation” for further information. For the year ended December 31, 2021, all of the contracts for the Boutiques under Continu Professionals were time and material contracts, with a typical service agreement between Continu Professionals and a client being for an average duration of twelve months. Continu Professionals also engages in executive search assignments, including providing assessment services, for some of its existing customer. _Types of clients and job candidates_ Continu Professionals provides nationwide coverage through the Netherlands, offering a high degree of specialization through its job candidates. The Powerhouse is recognized among the Group for its best practices with respect to job candidate retention, providing regular touch points with job candidates throughout their candidate journey, starting from first contact through to satisfaction surveys while on assignment, as well as scheduled touch points to recognize and celebrate key events such as signing a contract and the job candidate’s birthday. The service agreements Continu Professionals enters into with clients will vary from client to client depending on their end-market and their staffing needs. For instance, Continu Professionals placed 78 job candidates at the world’s leading lithography company which generated approximately €2.5 million in revenue in 2021. Continu Professionals also placed 42 job candidates in engineering and construction roles as well as a sales manager on premises at one of our clients, a European construction services business, in 2021. This engagement brought in approximately €2.2 million in revenue in 2021. ----- _Financial performance and other operating metrics_ Since its acquisition in September 2015, Continu’s EBITDA has grown from €11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA growth of 1.3% per annum, and its revenue has grown from €68.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to €97.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (which includes the combined revenue contribution from the bolt-on acquisitions of MT&V in June 2018, Hartd in December 2018, and TechMatch in January 2020 of €38.0 million), with a revenue growth of 6.0% per annum. Continu’s revenue growth was affected in 2020 and 2021 due to management issues and adverse regulatory conditions, as well as due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. As of September 30, 2022, Continu Professionals had 19 branches, with 240 in-house full-time equivalents and 1,845 job candidates at work. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Continu Professionals had revenues of €134.4 million. Nearly all of the Continu Professionals’ sales revenue is generated in the Netherlands.

Accent operates in a competitive and consolidated market where it challenges larger global staffing solutions companies or brands, as well as regional companies or brands. _End-markets served and contract framework_ Accent focuses on the more sustainable and profitable “temp-to-perm” contracts, with a focus on different niches and with a strong network of local branches, specialized to serving a specific type of job candidate profile and client end-markets. Nearly all of the sales revenue from this Powerhouse comes from SMEs or intermediate sized enterprises who value speed and flexibility, a close customerrelationship and who are willing to pay a premium for Accent’s services, therefore quality over quantity. In terms of end-markets, Accent provides primarily blue-collar job candidates, of whom approximately 25% are foreign workers, to a wide range of end-markets. The largest end-markets served by Accent’s job candidates are the construction, transportation, food service and hospitality end-markets, though our job candidates also serve a number of clients in the services, healthcare and transport markets. Accent is mostly engaged on time and material contracts, with a focus on “temp-to-perm” assignments. Pursuant to temporary worker legislation in Belgium, Accent is typically able to align its job candidates’ contract durations with its clients’ contract duration, resulting in no exposure to bench time. See “Regulation.” For the year ended December 31, 2021, nearly all of Accent’s contracts were time and material contracts, with an average duration of 40 days. Since 2018, Accent has also begun to offer search and selection services via its Ctrl-F Boutique, which are invoiced on a fee basis and are primarily ----- supported by an internal “digital talent hunter” recruitment team. Accent’s revenues also include those generated by NOWJOBS and Gighouse in Belgium. _Types of clients and job candidates_ Accent has a strong focus on developing best services for a fast-yet-high-quality candidate and client matching, driven by strong digital initiatives for which Accent is being recognized as a pioneer in the market. Since assignments are typically for a relatively short duration, being able to quickly match a job candidate and client quickly is important. Accent combines strong intimacy in the front with a strong efficiency in the back. Accent assisted one of our clients, a sanitaryware wholesaler with its on-going demand to find temporary job candidates and then hire them as permanent employees by co-creating a website for applicants and helped to coordinate the required education for future sanitary technicians. Accent also assigned a dedicated single point of contact to a large infrastructure company to assist, through one of its Boutiques, Engie, in the recruitment of the more technical profiles. _Financial performance and other operating metrics_ As of September 30, 2022, Accent had 384 branches, which branches reflect teams dedicated to specific specialty job candidates, 1,166 full-time equivalent employees and 28,987 job candidates at work.

It is focused on the Dutch specialty blue-collar staffing market, with operations in the Netherlands, as well as its branches in Hungary, Lithuania, Spain, Poland and Romania, which are part of its international recruiting network. _End-markets served and contract framework_ Covebo focuses on temporary staffing for two primary end-markets: (1) construction and technical, including technical, construction and infrastructure jobs; and (2) production and logistics, including food, logistics and industry jobs. Nearly all of the sales revenue from this Powerhouse comes from SMEs or intermediate sized enterprises, with certain exceptions relating to larger clients in the production and logistics end-market. Covebo provides blue-collar job candidates to its clients, of which typically approximately 80% are foreign workers. The most frequent end-markets served by Covebo’s job candidates are the food production, retail, logistics, engineering and construction and infrastructure end-markets. Through its digital initiative Fygi, Covebo offers interim recruitment, search and selection and recruitment marketing services. Independent freelancers will become recruiters for mostly white-collar profiles at different companies, by using Covebo’s digital tools and platforms. Covebo takes a commission on the revenue generated by these freelancers. Revenue of this initiative for the year ended December 31, 2021 was €5.4 million. Nearly all of Covebo’s contracts are typically flexible contracts, meaning that Covebo is not obligated to pay any temporary job candidate not engaged in billable work for up to the first 52 weeks (depending on the employment agreement entered into with such job candidate), with discretionary temporary employment agreements permitted to be entered into (with up to a maximum of six employment agreements) over the next three years (depending on the employment agreement entered into with such job candidate) thereafter. Covebo’s exposure to bench time is thus limited due to the regulatory framework and their ability to use of flexible contracts with job candidates. Some job candidates placed by Covebo are freelancers, especially in the VNOM offices of Covebo. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the substantial majority of Covebo’s service agreements with clients were time and material ----- contracts, with an average of 5.8 job candidates per client, with an average duration of approximately 41 weeks. Covebo New Energy was launched at Covebo. Covebo New Energy is specialized in mediating technicians in the sustainable industry, such as solar panel technicians, insulation technicians, electric charging station technicians, air and heat pump technicians, windmill technicians and technicians who specialize in other new energy sources. _Types of clients and job candidates_ Covebo was one of the first dedicated blue-collar foreign recruiting based staffing companies in the Netherlands. It offers a full-service foreign recruiting process for job candidates and clients by facilitating and organizing housing, transportation and insurance (including health insurance) and offering social guidance and support. In 2018, Covebo launched an in-house education program, the Covebo Craftsman School, to support its full-service proposition which offers foreign job candidates education on Dutch tools, materials and ways of working. The program trains and tests candidates on various skills such as masonry, plumbing, electrics and painting. It also facilitates quick onboarding since job candidates have been assessed as part of the training program and familiarized with customerspecific standards. _Financial performance and other operating metrics_ Since its acquisition in June 2015, and including the contributions of Accent NL, Covebo’s EBITDA has grown from €5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to €17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA growth of 21.4% per annum, and its revenue has grown from €117.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to €311.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with a revenue growth of 17.7% per annum. As of September 30, 2022, Covebo had 8,095 beds for job candidates, 1,365 cars for people at work and 7,788 health insurance policies for its foreign temporary job candidates. As of September 30, 2022, Covebo had 40 branches, 831 full-time equivalent employees, 12 international recruiting offices and over 12,156 job candidates at work. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Covebo had revenue of €540.7 million. Nearly all of the Powerhouse’s sales revenue is generated in the Netherlands.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

In June 2021, we acquired avanti, which complements TIMEPARTNER’s service portfolio by adding a presence in the medical and healthcare segment. Following the acquisition of LP Personalvermittlung, avanti will operate under our new Powerhouse, House of Care Talents Germany. In addition, Zaquensis, previously a Powerhouse in our legacy general staffing segment, is now part of the TIMEPARTNER operation following the partial merger between TIMEPARTNER and Zaquensis in the second quarter of 2021. TIMEPARTNER also has operations in the Czech Republic. _End-markets served and contract framework_ TIMEPARTNER typically provides low- to medium-skilled job candidates who are from general backgrounds to clients from a diversified group of end-markets, with the greatest concentration of clients typically being from the industry, logistics, construction, aviation, food and automotive endmarkets. The job candidate placements by TIMEPARTNER (except IBB and AERO) are typically short- to medium-term (with a maximum duration of 18 months), unless agreed otherwise by company unions (approximately 48 months). In general, the contract framework for temp employees are indefinite duration, making it a core task for TIMEPARTNER to perfectly match the job assignments with the contract duration. That means it is crucial to make sure the (very short) notice period of client agreements corresponds to the assignment duration and matches the notice periods of the employees, ----- or otherwise to staff temp employees on new assignments. TIMEPARTNER also provide specialized services through avanti in relation to the provision of medical and care personnel to hospitals, special clinics, rehabilitation clinics and nursing homes. _Types of clients and job candidates_ TIMEPARTNER’s clients particularly value the ability to place job candidates quickly (particularly for short-term staffing needs), quality candidate pools, assistance and peace of mind regarding our ability to help them comply with and navigate complicated regulatory and compliance landscapes, and good value for money. Additionally, customers are using our competence as a master vendor to manage all their temporary workforce, or, to a less extent, as a recruiting partner. TIMEPARTNER’s job candidates are often looking for an HR staffing company that can find them a job quickly, treat them well, provide opportunities for clients to take them on as permanent employees and have a good pool of local job opportunities. TIMEPARTNER facilitates these interests from clients and job candidates by having good industry knowledge in the markets that we serve, making decisions quickly, having a quality pool of candidates available (and working with our international recruiting network, where needed, to ensure we can help staff shortages) and job candidates for management positions with good experience and skills. _Financial performance and other operating metrics_ Since its acquisition in 2016 (based on the combined performance of Zaquensis and TIMEPARTNER following their merger in 2021 and including the contributions from the bolt-on acquisitions of Mach in 2017 and Weiderer in 2018), TIMEPARTNER’s EBITDA has grown from €28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to €33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA growth of 3.1% per annum, while its revenue has decreased from €425.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to €420.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the impact of the AüG regulatory reform and the dynamics in the aerospace segment. As of September 30, 2022, TIMEPARTNER had 190 branches, 555 full-time equivalent employees and 10,264 job candidates at work. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, TIMEPARTNER had Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue of €356.6 million. Nearly all of the Powerhouse’s sales revenue is generated in Germany. **TMI** On March 3, 2022, we acquired TMI, our new Powerhouse in our specialized talent solutions segment. TMI specializes in providing staffing service for the healthcare sector in the Netherlands, assisting with the recruitment of candidates for healthcare providers such as hospitals, public care institutions, ambulance staff and nursing homes. TMI also supplies temporary staff, intermediates for freelancers, and offers flexible jobs. Their job candidates usually include doctors, nursing staff, psychologists, and pharmacists. _End-markets served and contract framework_ TMI provides services primarily to clients in the healthcare sector, such as hospitals, public care institutions, ambulance staff and nursing homes. Services rendered include providing temporary staff (flex, 0-hours and secondment) in times of peaks or sickness, as well as general recruitment. Placements in this segment are typically short- to medium-term, unless agreed otherwise by the client. Most clients have a framework contract with TMI for a period of one to three years with yearly indexation or collective employment raise. _Types of clients and job candidates_ TMI provides services to a broad array of healthcare clients, who particularly value the high quality candidates, broad pool of professionals and the “one stop shopping” service model offered by TMI. ----- TMI is well recognized as the leading healthcare staffing company in the Netherlands that helps clients to ensure continuity of healthcare services despite an ever-increasing shortage of qualified personnel in the industry. TMI’s job candidates are often looking for a staffing company that provides a broad selection of clients and placement opportunities without the restrain of irregular rosters, and offers good financial benefits and the opportunity for further education (such as through the TMI Academy). _Financial performance and other operating metrics_ As of September 30, 2022, TMI had 16 branches, 123 full-time equivalent employees and 3,114 job candidates at work. We estimate TMI contributed €56.0 million to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.28,Digital Initiatives,18.28.1,Mobile technology,"----- Our Group is strategically committed to mobile-based recruiting solutions to reach a larger pool of potential candidates and increase user engagement. We have several live projects, including the following mobile apps: - **_SWOP and SWOP Recruiter: Inspired by Tinder, SWOP provides a mobile platform for job candidates to “swipe right” to indicate interest on job opportunities they wish to pursue. SWOP was downloaded 17,596 times in 2019, 46,540 times in 2020 and 14,753 times in 2021. SWOP has enabled the placement of 60.75 job candidates per month on average as of September 30, 2022. The app was updated in early 2020 in order to include not only Accent or Ctrl-F vacancies, but also include vacancies that are aggregated from other company websites, thus allowing it to show approximately 60,000 vacancies (of which approximately 23,000 come from Accent) in the Belgian market and 72,000 vacancies in the Dutch market as of October 2022. Candidates swiping on non-Accent vacancies are also contacted in order to help provide them with the necessary support if they do wish so. In May 2021, we launched SWOP Recruiter, which consists of a free digital platform that helps Belgian SMEs with the day-to-day management of their vacancies. The application is currently linked to our SWOP application, and includes a job board multi-poster tool that allows SMEs to post vacancies simultaneously on multiple platforms. - **_NOWJOBS: NOWJOBS is a mobile platform aimed at reaching student job candidates and for flexible jobs (such as short-term part-time jobs), historically a difficult market to serve due to low margins. By implementing a mobile, app-based platform, NOWJOBS has matched over 3,100 active companies with more than 30,800 job candidates in 2021 on a low cost basis for our Accent Powerhouse. NOWJOBS was launched in the Netherlands in late 2019 and in France in 2021. We also recently launched NOWJOBS in Germany in June 2022. Since NOWJOBS mostly services the entertainment, hospitality and retail segment, it was heavily impacted during the lockdown period during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in the second quarter of 2020; however, it still managed to reach a revenue in 2020 that was only 8.4% below its 2019 revenue. It has complemented its offering now also towards food retail and food production companies, as well as home delivery models, such as Take-Away.com and Hello Fresh. We acquired StaffMe in July 2022, a French digital platform focusing on student employment and which is primarily active in the retail, health event and hospitality sectors, supplementing our NOWJOBS offering. Through this acquisition, we also acquired the other companies of the StaffMe group, including the StaffMe Academy, the first training organization for young entrepreneurs, and the Accelerator, a program of integration through selfemployment for those who are far from employment. NOWJOBS will operate under the StaffMe brand in France given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country. - **_Gighouse: Gighouse is a mobile app designed to reach freelance or independent job candidates and match them with clients. We add value by screening the freelancers or independent job candidates to check their qualifications and experience to provide a narrower pool of suitable options for clients. We also monitor the customer assignments to ensure freelance job candidates are assigned to legitimate projects. - **_FYGI:_** FYGI is a mobile platform that connects freelance recruiters to Covebo’s staffing network and job candidate pool on a commission basis. FYGI focuses on providing freelance recruiters access to a larger pool of potential job candidates than they would independently be able to access in order to fill permanent positions. Additionally, we have a full team dedicated to creating a Group framework and data platform for each Powerhouse to develop tailored mobile solutions for its end-markets. We have also developed CV Creator, a service that allows job seekers to create professional résumés quickly and easily. CV Creator is available as a free web service. We developed together with the Ghent University the MySkillz tools, through which job candidates can perform tests and get insights about ----- themselves. One of such tests is ‘Who am I,’ which allows job candidates to better understand how they function in their professional lives. Another test is ‘Who do I want to work for,’ which helps to indicate the types of companies that fit best for a particular candidate. We are also developing a client version of the ‘Who do I want to work for’ test, which indicates the type of job candidates that fit best with a particular team leader, and the ‘My brains’ test which attempts to indicate the intelligence level of a job candidate within their education level.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Recruiters get a fully customizable chatbot colleague that screens and communicates with job candidates located anywhere around the clock. Dora speaks seven languages and can work side-by-side with live recruitment team as the first line of interactions with job candidates. Dora is capable of reengaging existing job candidates on any marketing channel, including website, database, social media channel, job board and applicant tracking system. Dora held approximately 63,000 interviews in 2021. This technology helps find passive and active job candidates and creates efficiency in the reaching and screening process.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.28,Digital Initiatives,18.28.3,Matching technology,"Matching candidates to open positions is a critical component to our business and we are developing solutions to optimize the matching processes using data analysis and AI. Such matching technology projects focus on improving the quality of the data, including by encouraging individuals to update their information directly on our platforms and mobile applications. Additionally, we are developing and experimenting with AI-enabled speech-to-text tools, including for the MyAccent app, an app that is connected with Google Assistant (for instance via smartphone or Google Home) to engage in a job search. By converting the job candidate’s speech into text on such platforms, we will be able to develop and test methods to automatically detect job candidates’ skills, interests and personality traits and to better prepare our job candidates for interviews for consultant positions, so we can then more efficiently and effectively match job candidates to appropriate job opportunities. These initiatives aim to increase the quality and efficiency of matching and to identify skill set needs in order to develop appropriate training. Together with the Ghent University, we developed soft skills testing to allow candidates to discover their personal preferences as to the type of companies they wish to work for or as to their own personality.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.28,Digital Initiatives,18.28.4,,"We develop digital initiatives with a dual purpose: (i) to support growth initiatives for our operations by enabling us to reach additional job candidates or serve new end-markets in a fully digital manner, and (ii) to introduce cost efficiencies to our processes to remain competitive against technological developments. By producing tools for our business units to meet business needs where no applicable tool exists, we aim to disrupt the existing staffing market and to expand our market share by developing new solutions or end-markets. Our digital initiatives are typically not directly revenue-generating, with the exception of SWOP Recruiter, NOWJOBS and Gighouse, but instead indirectly contribute to revenue generation by assisting us with identifying additional job candidates or matching them with clients. Such initiatives can also help us reduce our expenses by automating or introducing other time efficiencies into certain time-intensive aspects of the recruiting lifecycle. Once a digital initiative has been developed and tested, it is typically launched by one of our Powerhouses. Any revenue generated by the digital initiative, whether directly or indirectly, would be accounted for as part of the revenue of the staffing unit to which the Powerhouse belongs. During 2021, we centralized all our digital assets in House of Invest, creating one platform to meet current needs and invest in new needs as they arise. This enabled us to further invest in our digital roadmap and internationalize our digital initiatives. The main purpose of House of Invest is to roll out the digital initiatives across all House of HR Powerhouses and Boutiques and to capitalize on a centralized knowledge base. House of Invest now owns NOWJOBS, Gighouse, SWOP and SWOP Recruiter, Continu-Connect, CV creator and My Talents (Softskillz), holds minority ownerships in Dora and Ariad (a traditional digital marketing staffing company) and a majority ownership in Book’u. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from digital solutions amounted to 2.6% of total revenue, compared to 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We strive to keep our digital development team lean and operationally independent, which we believe promotes an entrepreneurial, start-up-like culture within the team. Re-usability of our developments is key, so applications can be exchanged across different geographies and our operating companies. We have in the past and expect in the future to use acquisitions as another means to acquire additional digital technologies that will complement our digital initiatives strategy or instill a more rapid growth of our sales through the digital platforms, particularly NOWJOBS. Currently, we are developing a CDP to consolidate all candidate data and leverage this data to gain better access to job candidates and improve our matching capabilities. We also invest in AI tools to improve matching accuracy. Our philosophy for job applications is “mobile-first,” meaning we are developing our digital platforms in a way that clients and job candidates can match easily on mobile phones.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.29,M&A Process and Criteria,18.29.1,Selection criteria,"We use an initial set of criteria to identify targets. These criteria examine the historic growth, geographic location, staffing segments, growth and margin prospects, end-market specialization and cultural fit to investigate M&A opportunities. Targets that are determined not to fit the selection criteria are eliminated from consideration. Our criteria include: - **_Geographic location: We look for targets in countries that have a stable economy with low employment, high salary level, high temporary staff penetration, a stable regulatory environment and supply and demand mismatch for skilled labor. Our current key areas of focus include countries where we are already present, particularly Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Switzerland, as well as new geographic or other development areas, including Austria, the Nordic countries and targets in other countries where the target offers digital technology that complements our strategy. - **_Staffing segment: We look for targets in both our engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions segments. By targeting the same staffing segments as our Powerhouses, we can reinforce their expertise areas or geographic coverage through bolt-on acquisitions. We can also look at new areas of expertise or areas in which we want to grow more extensively, such as the healthcare, life science, IT sectors and the digital, financial and strategic consulting profiles. - **_Growth and margin prospects: We seek targets where we see above-market growth and margin prospects. To that end, we look for targets (1) offering specialist services, focusing on attractive specialties, which we believe drive higher price points for services (see “—End-market _Specialization” below), (2) having competitive positioning with a high relative market share_ and demonstrated track record and experience and (3) displaying operational excellence with well-structured commercial processes, lean cost structures and entrepreneurial ability. - **_End-market specialization: We look for targets that are staffing end-markets with significant levels of job shortages. Currently, the core end-markets we believe face such shortages include engineering, financial services, IT, pharmaceuticals, life sciences and healthcare. Furthermore, our current operations in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands provide HR solutions that meet most of the top critical job shortages in those markets. We have identified nursing, healthcare life science, IT sectors and the digital, financial and strategic consulting profiles as areas where we still have expansion possibilities. These are specializations that we may develop to fill our specialization gaps and meet the critical job shortages in those geographic markets but also acquisitions may be one way to move into these end-market specializations. Expanding each Powerhouse across our core geographies is also part of our acquisition strategy. We also consider opportunistic acquisitions of targets that do not serve these end-markets, but which show high growth and margin prospects. - **_Cultural fit: We look for targets that have like-minded management teams. Since our Group operates in a people business, finding targets that are a good cultural fit is critical. We also generally invite the active members of the management teams to stay on board after an acquisition. ----- - **_Valuation: Historically, we have acquired bolt-on acquisitions in the range of 5x to 8x, and platform acquisitions in the range of 8x to 9x LTM EBITDA.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.29,M&A Process and Criteria,18.29.2,M&A assessment and integration process,"Our structured process helps us identify opportunities, investigate and assess the targets that meet our selection criteria and support the target company once it has been acquired. Three levels of our organization are involved in deal sourcing: our central Group (especially our M&A Department, which includes M&A analysts and an M&A legal counsel), our Powerhouses, and our shareholders. Each level evaluates opportunities through the rubric of our selection criteria. Opportunities identified which meet the selection criteria are considered on a weekly basis via the M&A team and are then evaluated by our investment committee and an opportunities file is maintained. Our investment committee includes representatives from each of the three constituencies (our central Group, our operating companies, and certain of our shareholders). To further assess an opportunity that meets our selection criteria and undertake due diligence, we typically try to have a brief meeting with management or advisors before we sign a non-binding indicative offer letter and then undertake due diligence on the target, including meeting with its founders and management team, and prepare a short file that summarizes our assessment of the target company, its market and its key financial and other metrics. The investment committee will evaluate the opportunities and, if recommended, they are presented to our Board for a go/no go decision. Opportunities may be approved or rejected, or the Board may recommend that more time needs to be taken for further assessment. If approved, we will submit a binding offer and determine which entity in the Group will acquire the target and discuss the target operating model. Typically for deals that are closely related to one of our Powerhouses, the acquisition will be undertaken by that Powerhouse, with deals less closely related or very large being acquired at the central Group level. The assessment process from initial sourcing to closing takes an average of six to nine months to complete. Once a deal closes, our central support team assists acquired companies. The central team provides performance support by sharing best practices, financial guidelines and reporting templates and assists with regulatory compliance issues. The time required to integrate the target into our Group varies depending on the size of the target, but typically takes six to nine months from closing. Financial integration is prioritized and is typically completed within 90 days of closing.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.29,M&A Process and Criteria,18.29.3,Our value proposition for target company owners,"We believe our approach to M&A has created an attractive value proposition for company owners at target companies which have contributed to our M&A track record. We believe four aspects of our M&A approach contribute to our appeal to targets and our track record at closing transactions where we have submitted a binding offer: - **_Financial incentives: As part of our M&A approach, we generally either offer our management team and individual platform or bolt-on managers a local minority investment (typically for smaller acquisitions that may need to continue on a standalone basis), and/or we will offer ordinary shares, often combined with access to the Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”), which is linked to the performance of their respective companies. This equity type of ownership allows us to continue to align the incentives of those at the Powerhouse level with both the performance of our Group and their individual Powerhouse. Typically for smaller acquisitions, we may continue to acquire only a stake in the target company, but immediately include a mechanism to roll over shares at group level, exchanging local shares for ordinary and MIP. - **_Operational freedom:_** For platform acquisitions that are broadening our base of services offered, we typically offer target companies the option of retaining their full autonomy at the level of their entities’ operations. We also typically preserve the brand identity of the acquired companies, which are not consumed into the House of HR brand or the brand of any Powerhouse. Bolt-on acquisitions may retain less operational autonomy, depending on the ----- nature of the acquisition and how it is integrated into our Group, but we also typically preserve their identity and branding. - **_Support on critical issues:_** Companies joining the Group benefit from support on complex regulatory and compliance topics from our central teams, and IT security and financing and financial reporting immediately begin to integrate. These companies are also provided with access to our foreign staffing recruiting network and experience, our digital platforms (though they may require adaptation and implementation for their local markets) and the possibility of accessing our credit lines at a Group level. - **_Our reputation: We are a leading company for specialized HR solutions with a strong Organic Growth track record and a reputation for operational excellence and quality. We also have a track record of successful acquisitions.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

The put option may be exercised by the sellers upon completion of the information and consultation of the relevant employee representative bodies to which the offer has been submitted and we are awaiting for written confirmation of approval. The acquisition is expected to be completed in December 2022, subject to the put option being exercised by the sellers, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Following the acquisition of ABMI, we expect to combine ABMI with Abylsen in order to create a new Powerhouse, ABY Engineering. We also have a number of other potential targets in our pipeline for 2022: we have submitted one nonbinding offer, we are currently reviewing the investment memorandum for one target and we have made non-committal contact for several other targets.

Beginning in 2018, we have also been focusing on bolt-on acquisitions to enhance the platforms of our existing Powerhouses, including most recently signing the purchase agreements for the bolt-on acquisitions in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Bolt-on acquisitions allow our Powerhouses to either expand geographically or gain expertise in a certain endmarket or job profiles. While the growth of our Addressable Market slowed down during the Covid-19 pandemic, the economies in our primary markets have fully recovered in 2021, and according to SIA, our Addressable Market is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 5% from 2021 to 2023.

Under the MRA process, our IT managers discuss and identify a list of mandatory, recommended and allowed applications, processes and technologies on a Group-wide basis. Mandatory items include, for instance, a common email platform, Office 365, a disaster recovery plan and securityrelated software, such as password vault and spam, multi-factor authentication and phishing protection. This MRA process aims to lower operational costs, improve price negotiation positions, enhance specialized IT knowledge and support available across our Group and facilitate synergies across Powerhouses. It also assists our Powerhouses with staying attuned to modern applications and software advancements. Under the revised Group guidelines, local servers are no longer allowed and must be transitioned as soon as possible to our central cloud server on Microsoft Azure. Powerhouses are required to use at a minimum a Tier 3 data center (which is a data center that provides redundancy, dual-powered servers, network links and other IT components) until such transition is complete. We are aiming to complete the consolidation of our data centers on the cloud for the entire Group. Migration to the cloud by our Belgium data centers has been completed and full migration of production servers towards Azure was completed in the first quarter of 2021.

House of Invest is able to integrate and reuse certain concepts that were developed in the past when designing and developing new applications, which helps to lower our internal development cost.

Staffing solutions providers are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation: - regulation of the relationship between a staffing solutions provider and its job candidates; - regulation of the relationship between a staffing solutions provider and its clients; - registration, licensing, record keeping and reporting requirements; - substantive limitations on the provider’s operations; - health and safety regulations; and - data protection regulations. In most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany, staffing solutions providers are considered the legal employers of their temporary employees. In other jurisdictions, staffing solutions providers are not considered the direct legal employers of temporary employees, but they still have the legal responsibility to collect taxes and social security deductions and transmit such amounts to taxation authorities. Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and regulations that apply in each of the countries in which we have significant operations. In addition to applicable national laws and regulations, Directive 2008/104/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 19, 2008 on temporary agency work (the “Temporary Agency Work Directive”) also regulates temporary agency work at the level of the European Union. The aim of the Temporary Agency Work Directive is notably to lay down a principle of nondiscrimination and equal treatment for job candidates in relation to the employees of the client as a general rule. It also sets clear limits to prohibitions and restrictions that may be imposed on the use of temporary agency work, while also setting common minimum standards for temporary agency work in the EU. The Temporary Agency Work Directive stipulates that basic working and employment conditions of job candidates shall be, for the duration of their assignment at a client, at least those that would apply if they had been recruited directly by the client to hold the same position. The Temporary Agency Work Directive allows member states to make exceptions to this principle of nondiscrimination in the cases of job candidates assigned on the basis of a permanent agreement and who continue to be paid in the time between assignments, and collective agreements and assignments derogating from the principle while respecting the overall protection of temporary agency workers.

However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants— _Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate_ Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee, provide security with respect to, or have their shares pledged in favor of, the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.9,Note Guarantees,21.9.1,General,"On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by Villa Dutch Finco B.V., a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) organized and existing under the laws of the Netherlands, having its registered office at Strawinskylaan 1209, WTC Tower A, 12[th] floor, 1077 XX Amsterdam, and its official seat in Amsterdam, and registered with the Trade and Company Register (Kamer van Koophandel) under number 86918826 (the “Original Guarantor”). Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, on or prior to March 3, 2023, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior basis by certain members of the House of HR Group that will guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Post-Closing Guarantors”). Such members of the House of HR Group that are currently expected to grant such Note Guarantees are SOLCOM GmbH, Accent Jobs For People NV, Accent Construct NV, House of HR NV, The House of Finance NV, Continu B.V., Covebo Productie en Logistiek B.V., Covebo Techniek B.V., TimePartner Personalmanagement GmbH, Talent & Pro Nederland B.V. and Wyzer B.V. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by _Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to and in accordance with_ the Agreed Security Principles and subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility will be guaranteed on a senior basis, and the Second Lien Facility will be guaranteed on a subordinated basis, by each Guarantor. French Bidco is also an obligor under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, but will not provide a Note Guarantee or be an obligor under the Bridge Facility Agreement or the Second Lien Facility Agreement. See “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.” As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the expected Post-Closing Guarantors represented 63.8% of Like-for-Like Revenues of the House of HR Group, 38.0% of the consolidated assets (excluding intercompany eliminations) of the House of HR Group and 89.1% of Like-for-Like EBITDA of the House of HR Group. By its terms, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws and the Note Guarantees of, or the relevant Note Documents to be entered into by, certain Guarantors organized in certain jurisdictions, including, without limitation, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany will contain language limiting the amount of indebtedness guaranteed or qualifying the Note Guarantee in order to address applicable local law considerations (including preservation of share capital and statutory reserves, capitalization, prohibited financial assistance, corporate benefit principles and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders and directors or managers). In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles ----- as described below under “—Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, liquidity impairment rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Risk Factors— Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The insolvency laws of the Netherlands and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined below), including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the_ liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ The Issuer is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital stock of its Subsidiaries. As such, the Issuer will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to it to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes. A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles or other limitations. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (including Disqualified Stock, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture.

Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and/or the Security Agent (as applicable) without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

In addition, on or prior to March 3, 2023, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured by (collectively, the “Post-Closing Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”): - share pledges granted by wholly owned Material Subsidiaries incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction over the shares held in each Material Subsidiary incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction; - in respect of a Post-Closing Guarantor (if any) incorporated in England and Wales, floating security over substantially all assets located in its jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary “excluded assets,” including real estate, and other customary exclusions, materiality thresholds and exceptions); and - in respect of a Post-Closing Guarantor (if any) incorporated in the United States, security over substantially all assets located in its jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary “excluded assets,” including real estate, and other customary exclusions, materiality thresholds and exceptions), in each case, where to do so would not have a material adverse effect on their ability to conduct their business and operations, as determined by each such Post-Closing Guarantor in its sole and absolute discretion. The Collateral and any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement constitute “Charged Property.” The Charged Property will also secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility on a _pari passu basis and the Second Lien Facility on a second-ranking basis, and may also secure certain_ Hedging Obligations, any Additional Notes and certain other future Indebtedness. In addition, under certain circumstances, including a repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under Facility B, any Revolving Facility (including the Original Revolving Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(5) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness” below, may be re-designated as a “super senior” obligation under the Intercreditor_ Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property after the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior Hedging Obligations) have been paid in full. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.” ----- Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain _Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the_ Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Charged Property in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Charged Property will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Charged Property pursuant to the Transaction Security Documents. All Charged Property will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Note Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. No appraisals of the Charged Property have been made in connection with the Offering. By its nature, some or all of the Charged Property will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Charged Property may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes _and Our Structure—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will be granted as security for the Notes, future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Notes and it may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral and the Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_ The Liens on the Charged Property will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Charged Property (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity impairment or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations _and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenants described below under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged or_ assigned, and any pledge or assignment over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), and certain guarantees may not be granted in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or may be limited.

----- - a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal and notarial fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under the Indenture) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Finance Documents (as defined in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” above) (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles;

When entering into such Transaction Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien ----- Facility Agreement and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests and local court decisions, the relevant Transaction Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees).

If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Transaction Security Documents. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would entitle each lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts outstanding to it under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement and could trigger a change of control under other financing arrangements of the Group. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and_ _“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such_ restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, ----- the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the relevant series of Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to zero. During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the definitions of “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens” and for no other covenant). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “— _Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period_ (including with respect to an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of “— _Limitation on Indebtedness”; (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such_ reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “— _Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”; (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted_ Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions ----- _from Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the_ covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.” Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period) and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. There can be no assurance that any series of Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event and a Reversion Date; provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the Covenant Suspension Event to be effective. The Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the ratings of the Notes (or deemed to have knowledge of the ratings of the Notes, or of the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event or a Reversion Date, unless so notified in accordance with this paragraph), (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date have occurred or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

On the 366th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) €86.5 million and (y) an amount equal to 25% of LTM EBITDA in a single transaction, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Senior Secured Indebtedness, to the holders or lenders of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and (ii) in the case of such other Senior Secured Indebtedness, the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such Senior Secured Indebtedness. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided above) (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”) with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes tendered and other Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the ----- Issuer shall prepay, repay or purchase the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis (or otherwise in accordance with the Relevant Clearing System) based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose permitted under the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors or managers) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees (but the Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer or another member of the Group becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of the lenders under such agreements to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such ----- prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes could constitute an Event of Default (subject to the relevant grace periods and other provisions described under “—Events of Default” below) under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

In relation to the definitions set out in the Indenture and all other related provisions of the Note Documents (including any Applicable Metric): (i) all calculations will be as determined in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer (including in respect of Synergies); and (ii) all calculations in respect of Synergies (in each case actual or anticipated) may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such Synergies were realized on the first day of the Relevant Period. Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income for any part of a Relevant Period falling prior to the Issue Date shall be calculated on an actual basis over the Relevant Period (whereby for any part of the applicable Relevant Period falling prior to the date on which the House of HR Group became part of the Group, such amount shall be calculated based on actual historic data for the corresponding period available and by reference to the House of HR Group as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and the other provisions of the Indenture) or, at the Issuer’s option, on the basis of the final management case financial model. ----- Unless a contrary indication appears, a reference in the Note Documents to Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, LTM EBITDA, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is to be construed as a reference to Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, LTM EBITDA, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Group on a consolidated basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in the Indenture), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof but excluding Excess Cash Flow, the Issuer shall be permitted to: (a) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from: (i) the Transactions; (ii) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting; (iii) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing businesses; (iv) Restructuring Costs; (v) research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof); and/or (vi) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases) and, in each case, any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under the accounting principles) or any other changes in the applicable accounting principles; and/or (b) include any addbacks (without further verification or diligence) for adjustments (including anticipated Synergies) or costs or expenses of a type included in “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” in this Offering Memorandum or otherwise related to the Transactions and/or any base case model or quality of earnings report relating to a Permitted Acquisition prepared by an independent third party and and/or taken into account in determining “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” or any financing EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for a Permitted Acquisition and/or any research and development expenditure (which is not otherwise capitalized). When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the option of the Issuer, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction. If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; _provided that (a) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the_ basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as contemplated in clause (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto. If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations. If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing). ----- Subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on _Indebtedness,” in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action_ or transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer determines (in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such Applicable Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction. If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence or drawing of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility or any ancillary facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric. If, in connection with the same Applicable Transaction or otherwise substantially simultaneously: (a)(i) any Applicable Metrics required to be determined by reference to a fixed currency amount or a percentage of LTM EBITDA (a “fixed permission”) are intended to be utilized; and/or (ii) revolving Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness under the Reserved Indebtedness Amount) is intended to be Incurred; and (b) any Applicable Metric required to be determined by reference to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric (a “ratio-based permission”) are intended to be utilized (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination of any increase or decrease in any such Applicable Metric, including in accordance with the clauses (v)(B)(1), (v)(B)(2) or (v)(B)(3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” then (x) amounts available to be incurred under the applicable ratio-based permissions shall first be calculated without giving effect to amounts to be incurred under the applicable fixed permissions or the applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness, or amounts previously incurred under such fixed permissions and not reclassified that are being repaid in connection with such Applicable Transaction, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer; and (y) thereafter, compliance with any relevant fixed permissions shall be calculated, and in each case, full pro forma effect shall be given to all increases to LTM EBITDA and repayments or discharges of Indebtedness in connection with such Applicable Transaction in accordance with the Indenture. If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical permission”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of a Permitted Acquisition or Permitted Investment, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such Permitted Acquisitions and/or Permitted Investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission. In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one Applicable Metric, the Issuer may (in its sole discretion), subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” classify and reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular Applicable Metric and will only be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those Applicable Metrics (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount may at the option of the Issuer be split between different Applicable Metrics). Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently ----- be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission. The Indenture will provide that references to (i) any matter being “permitted” by or under the Indenture (or any covenant or section thereof) or any other Note Document shall include references to such matters not being prohibited or otherwise being approved under the Indenture or such other Note Document and (ii) any transaction being in the “ordinary course of business” of a member of the Group shall be construed to include any transaction that is consistent with industry practice in the industries in which the Group operates or consistent with past practice of any member of the Group or the House of HR Group. For purposes of determining compliance with: (i) any euro-denominated Applicable Metric (other than in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Note Documents or related usage, ratchet or permission), the euro equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of exchange selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable Test Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange hedging entered into by the Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction); or (ii) any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Note Documents), the euro equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, at the Issuer’s option, using any of: (A) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates over the relevant testing period; (B) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial statements or management accounts; (C) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Test Date, if applicable); or (D) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging arrangement entered into by any member of the Group, and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or any breach of representation or warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the euro equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates. For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual _Period”):_ (i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount. For the purpose of this section and to the extent any Applicable Metric is used as the basis (in whole or in part) for permitting any transaction or making any determination under the Indenture (including on a pro forma basis), no item shall be included or excluded more than once where to do so would result in double counting. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (d) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to such clause (d) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant) or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant) or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant) (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is a Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (which shall be provided to the Holders) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time, not in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that ----- resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. If there is any breach of the Position Representation or failure to satisfy its Verification Covenant in accordance with a final and non-appealable court determination or order, then for purposes of determining the requisite level of consent for such Noteholder Direction, that breaching Holder’s position shall be treated as “not outstanding” for purposes of determining the denominator in the calculation of the requisite level of consent (and their position may not also be included in the numerator); and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction (provided that the relevant Position Representations are provided in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph) or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any Agent) shall not be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in good faith (provided that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud). The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any position representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its position representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any derivative instruments, Net Short position, long derivative instrument, short derivative instrument or otherwise. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on its rights, protections and benefits under the Indenture at all times, including without limitation, for actions that are taken and subsequently stayed or annulled. If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. ----- The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant titled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if in respect of any Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant), such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) Holders, or in the case of any Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant), Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders, or Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation (as applicable), have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default ----- in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) after the end of each fiscal year (or in the case of the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date, 150 days), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that has occurred during the previous year, and is continuing. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events that are continuing of which it is aware the occurrence of which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

The term “Qualifying Interest” means a direct or indirectly held interest – either by an entity individually or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group (samenwerkende groep) – that enables such entity or such collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entity's decisions and allows it to determine the other entity's activities (as interpreted by the European Court of Justice in case law on the right of freedom of establishment (vrijheid van vestiging)).",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Generally, a Noteholder is considered to hold a substantial interest in such company, if such holder alone or—in the case of an individual—together with a partner for Dutch tax purposes, or any relative by blood or by marriage in the ascending or descending line (including foster children) of the Noteholder or the partner, owns or holds, or is deemed to own or hold, certain rights to shares, including rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, shares, representing 5% or more of the Issuer’s issued capital as a whole or for any class of shares or profit participating certificates (winstbewijzen) relating to 5% or more of the Issuer’s annual profits or 5% or more of the Issuer’s liquidation proceeds. A deemed substantial interest may arise if a substantial interest (or part thereof) in a company has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, on a non-recognition basis; (iii) an entity that, although it is in principle subject to Dutch corporate income tax under the CITA, is not subject to Dutch corporate income tax or is fully or partly exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as a qualifying pension fund as described in section 5 CITA and a tax exempt investment fund (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 6a CITA); (iv) an investment institution (beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 28 CITA; or (v) that is an entity which is a resident of Aruba, Curacao or St. Maarten and fully or partly conducts a business through a permanent establishment (vaste _inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in_ Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba to which the Notes are attributable. _Residents of the Netherlands_ The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following Noteholders: (i) individuals who are resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Dutch Resident Individuals”); and (ii) entities or enterprises that are subject to the CITA and are resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Dutch Resident Corporate Entities”). _Dutch Resident Individuals_ Dutch Resident Individuals are generally subject to income tax at statutory progressive rates with a maximum of 49.50% on any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes, including any capital gains realized on any disposal, including the exchange or deemed exchange, of the Notes, where those benefits are attributable to: (i) an enterprise from which a Dutch Resident Individual derives profits, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or by being co-entitled (medegerechtigde) to the net worth of the enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or shareholder; or (ii) miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden), including activities beyond the scope of active portfolio investment activities (meer dan _normaal vermogensbeheer)._ ----- If the above-mentioned conditions (i) and (ii) do not apply to the Dutch Resident Individual, the Dutch Resident Individual's net investment assets (rendementsgrondslag) for the year will be subject to an annual Dutch income tax on a deemed return (with a maximum of 5.53% in 2022) under the regime for savings and investments (inkomen uit sparen en beleggen), insofar the Dutch Resident Individual's net investment assets for the year exceed a statutory threshold (heffingvrij vermogen). The deemed return on the Dutch Resident Individual's net investment assets for the year is taxed at a flat rate of 31% (rate for 2022). Actual income or capital gains realized in respect of the Notes are as such not subject to Dutch income tax. The net investment assets for the year are the fair market value of the investment assets less the allowable liabilities on 1 January of the relevant calendar year. The Notes are included as investment assets. The annual taxable benefit from a Dutch Resident Individual's assets and liabilities taxed under this regime, including the Notes, is based on the actual allocation of the Dutch Resident Individual's assets and liabilities over the following three categories: (i) bank savings, (ii) other investments, including the Notes, and (iii) liabilities. The tax is calculated as follows: (i) a deemed return on the fair market value of the actual amount of bank savings; _plus_ (ii) a deemed return on the fair market value of the actual amount of other investments, including the Notes; minus (iii) a deemed return on the fair market value of the actual amount of liabilities. The statutory threshold is divided pro-rata over the three assets and liabilities categories mentioned above. At the date hereof, the deemed return under (i) to (iii) above have not yet been determined for the year 2023. The definitive percentages for the year 2023 will be published in the first months of 2024. Transactions in the 3-month period before and after 1 January implemented to arbitrate between the deemed return percentages applicable to bank savings, other investments and liabilities will for this purpose be ignored if the holder of Notes cannot sufficiently demonstrate that such transactions are implemented for other than tax reasons. _Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_ Dutch Resident Corporate Entities are generally subject to corporate income tax on any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes or any capital gains realized on the disposal or deemed disposal, including the exchange or deemed exchange, of the Notes at a rate of 15% with respect to taxable profits up to €395,000 and 25.8% with respect to taxable profits in excess of that amount up to 25.8% (rates and brackets for 2022). _Non-Residents of the Netherlands_ The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following Noteholders: (i) individuals who are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Non-Dutch Resident Individuals”); and (ii) entities that are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities”). _Non-Dutch Resident Individuals_ ----- A Non-Dutch Resident Individual will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains derived from the purchase, ownership and disposal, including the exchange or deemed exchange, or transfer of the Notes, other than withholding tax as described above, unless: (i) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives profits from an enterprise, whether as entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of this enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or shareholder, and this enterprise is fully or partly carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands, to which the Notes are attributable; (ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives benefits from miscellaneous activities carried on in the Netherlands in respect of the Notes, including activities which are beyond the scope of active portfolio investment activities; or (iii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual is entitled to a share—other than by way of securities—in the profits of an enterprise, which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which the Notes are attributable. _Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_ A Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains derived from the purchase, ownership and disposal, including the exchange or deemed exchange, or transfer of the Notes, other than withholding tax as described above, unless: (i) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity derives profits from an enterprise, which is fully or partly carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands to which the Notes are attributable; or (ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity is entitled to a share—other than by way of securities—in the profits of an enterprise or a co-entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise, which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which the Notes are attributable.

It does not present a comprehensive or complete description of all aspects of Dutch tax law which could be relevant to a holder of the Notes (a “Noteholder”). For Dutch tax purposes, a Noteholder may include an individual or entity that does not hold the legal title of the Notes, but to whom or to which, the Notes are, or income from the Notes is, nevertheless attributed based either on this individual or entity owning a beneficial interest in the Notes or on specific statutory provisions. These include statutory provisions attributing the Notes to an individual who is, or who has directly or indirectly inherited from a person who was, the settlor, grantor or similar originator of a trust, foundation or similar entity that holds the Notes. This section is intended as general information only. Prospective Noteholders should consult their own tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of any acquisition, holding or disposal of the Notes.

Such a modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. The amount of any gain or loss recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a Note for a New Note would be determined by reference to the “issue price” of the New Note. The issue price of a New Note will equal the fair market value of such Note or such New Note at the time of the deemed exchange if such Note or such New Note were considered “publicly traded” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Debt Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder’s holding period in a New Note treated as received in the IPO Debt Pushdown generally will commence on the day after the IPO Debt Pushdown, and tax basis in such New Note would generally equal the issue price of such New Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of such deemed exchange will be taxed under the rules described under “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable _Disposition of Notes.” If the issue price of such New Note is less than its stated redemption price at_ maturity by a de minimis amount or more than a de minimis amount, such New Note will be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required to include such OID in their income (as ordinary income) as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income on the Notes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and ----- resulting OID, if any. In addition, the determination of whether the deemed New Notes are treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments would be made at the time of the modification.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,22,CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS,22.2,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,22.2.2,Additional Payments,"In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments on the Notes (as described under “Description of the Notes— _Withholding Taxes”) or make payments in redemption of the Notes in addition to their stated principal_ amount and accrued interest (as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”). If any such payment is treated as a contingent payment, subject to certain exceptions, the Notes may be treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments, in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying such additional amounts or making additional payments in redemption of the Notes does not result in the Notes being treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid, or additional payments in redemption of the Notes will have to be made, is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination that the Notes are not foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. Holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes, and may exceed the stated interest rate. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes would generally be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,22,CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS,22.2,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,22.2.3,Payments of Stated Interest,"Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount of stated interest on a Note (as well as any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest received, determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so received. If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such stated interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period ----- within each taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate on: (1) the last day of the accrual period; (2) the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or (3) the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five Business Days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquire and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election. Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will recognize ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income such U.S. Holder previously included in income with respect to such payment. This exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,22,CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS,22.2,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,22.2.4,Original Issue Discount,"If the Notes are issued at an “issue price” (as defined above) which is less than their stated redemption price at maturity such Notes will be considered to have been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless the difference is less than a de minimis threshold (generally equal to ¼ of 1% of the Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their “issue date”). The “issue date” is the first date upon which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for cash to persons other than bondhouses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers. If the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” (other than the initial short accrual period and the final accrual period) a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period generally will equal the excess, if any, of (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield to maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) over (b) the aggregate of all qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain circumstances, at a variable rate. Stated interest on the Notes should be treated as qualified stated interest. The “yield to maturity” is the discount rate that, when applied to all payments under a Note as of its issue date, results in a present value equal to the Note’s issue price. In general, the “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of the first accrual period is its issue price and, on any day thereafter, is the sum of the issue price and the amount of OID previously included in the gross income of any U.S. Holder, reduced by the amount of any payment (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) previously made on the Note. OID will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into United States dollars in the same manner as stated interest income accrued by a holder on the accrual basis, as described above. ----- A U.S. Holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference between the United States dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued interest). Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed: first, as the receipt of any stated interest payments called for under the terms of the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as the receipt of principal. A U.S. Holder may irrevocably elect, subject to certain limitations, to treat all interest on any Note as OID and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the method described above. The election is to be made for the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about this election. The rules regarding OID are complex and the rules described above may not apply in all cases. Accordingly, you should consult your tax advisors regarding their application.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Any non-U.S. withholding tax with respect to the Notes held by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There are significant limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, and recent U.S. regulations have imposed additional requirements that must be met for a foreign tax to be creditable (including requirements that a “covered withholding tax” be imposed on nonresidents in lieu of a generally applicable tax that satisfies the regulatory definition of an “income tax,” which may be unclear or difficult to determine).

If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the sale or other disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. ----- A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the amount paid for such Note by such U.S. Holder, increased by any previously accrued OID, if any. If a U.S. Holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the amount paid for the Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it makes the special election described in the preceding paragraph, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and, except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency gain or loss, generally will be long term capital gain or loss so long as the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of noncorporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively, and will generally be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest income or expense, including for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Note is the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Note.

Accordingly, even if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein.

The summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except for the discussions below under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,” and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the U.S. federal tax consequences described below.

There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare tax on net investment income, the alternative minimum tax, or the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders who elect to mark their investment to market, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt entities, regulated investment companies, tax exempt organizations, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass through entities and investors in such entities, entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction,” “constructive sale” or other integrated transaction, persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock (by vote or value) and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in Section 451 of the Code).

As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Issuer or any Guarantor incorporated under Dutch law. The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re litigated before a competent Dutch court. Under current practice, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected to render a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant U.S. court, provided that such judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction vis à vis the Issuer or a Guarantor incorporated under Dutch law on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) has not been rendered in violation of elementary principles of fair trial, (iii) is not contrary to the public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands and (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a non-Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is capable of being recognized in the Netherlands. ----- Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

In the absence of any bilateral or multilateral treaty, final and enforceable judgments rendered by foreign courts can be declared enforceable in Belgium (without review of the foreign judgment on the merits by the Belgian courts) according to the procedure set out in Articles 22 and sq. of the Belgian Code of Private International Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit International Privé) and provided that, pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents are produced in court by the claimant: - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law; - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law or an equivalent document in accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstrating that the judgment was served or notified to the party that did not appear; and - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has been notified to the defendant. However, the court will refuse recognition and enforcement in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law and notably (and, inter alia), if: - the consequences of the enforcement of the judgment would be manifestly contrary to Belgian public policy; - the rights of defense were not respected; - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets in such state without any further connection with the litigation in such state; - without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the judgment is not final or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the laws of the State where the judgment was rendered or the applicable federal rules; - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian conflict of law rules; - the decision is in conflict with either a decision rendered in Belgium or a decision previously rendered in another state and such decision can be recognized in Belgium; - the claim was introduced before the courts of such state after a claim, which is still pending and relating to the same matter and between the same parties, was introduced in a Belgian court; - the Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the claim; or - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to insolvency proceedings or corporate standing. ----- Note that, in accordance with Article 25, §2 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, Belgian courts will not carry out a review on the merits of the foreign judgment for which enforcement is sought.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.3,Germany,23.3.1,,"Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Germany. There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist: - if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not have jurisdiction; - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly; - if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; - if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S. federal or state court entered its judgment; - if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances). ----- Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provided for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States. In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon the Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Germany or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), replacing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended (as amended from time to time, the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), the court which shall have jurisdiction to commence the main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company (subject to certain exceptions) organized under the laws of a Member State is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the relevant Company’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, “COMI”) is situated. The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have different and even conflicting views. COMI is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office. Recital 28 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which “is ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the Company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its COMI. A Company’s COMI may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. The presumption described above shall however only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings (as defined in Article (3) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). Based on a recent decision by the European Court of Justice, the court of a Member State with which a request to open main insolvency proceedings has been lodged retains exclusive jurisdiction to open such proceedings where the center of the debtor’s main interests is moved to another Member State after that request has been lodged, but before that court has delivered a decision on it. If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in a Member State, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings initiated in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are automatically recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be initiated in another Member State in the event that the company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” ----- Secondary proceedings are limited to winding-up proceedings and the effects of such secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the company situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority that has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of ----- the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member State. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the comment of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of the group’s members. The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 and is therefore no longer a Member State (including for the purposes of the automatic recognition regime under the EU Insolvency Regulation). The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146), The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/1459) and The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/647) set out a number of amendments to the EU Insolvency Regulation as it applies in the United Kingdom since the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. There has been no agreement to replace the automatic recognition of United Kingdom insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. Absent such agreement, recognition in the United Kingdom of insolvency proceedings opened in an EU Member State is not automatic. However, such recognition may be available under the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, which has been implemented in the United Kingdom by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 and which provides for recognition of insolvency proceedings in other jurisdictions as either foreign main or foreign non-main proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,24,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,24.2,The Netherlands,24.2.1,Dutch Insolvency Law,"The Issuer and some Guarantors are incorporated in the Netherlands. Any insolvency proceeding concerning the Issuer or any Guarantor incorporated under Dutch law would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy ----- proceedings may also be opened in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not incorporated under Dutch law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are three primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. The third, the Dutch Scheme, allows a debtor to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings such as suspension of payments or bankruptcy. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of the three insolvency regimes is set out below. _Suspension of Payments_ An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non preferential creditors. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments proceeding. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. _Bankruptcy_ Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the ----- aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor incorporated under Dutch law will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified, unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro _memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be_ challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such _renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set off relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a set off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a ----- legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “— _Fraudulent Transfer.”_ Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

The pre-insolvency plan regime has been incorporated in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant to this Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Unlike a moratorium and in bankruptcy, a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, _inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court measures. Such composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors as compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition. A composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of noteholders. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a nonconsenting class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. During such period, inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such ----- stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

In general, under Dutch insolvency law mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and other liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme, now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed. Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition, foreclosure on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Under Dutch law, security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke _Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten_ vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document. In addition, the holders of the Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a transaction or a guarantee or security_ interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the transaction or the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the transaction or the guarantee or security interest if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) such transaction was conducted at a time that the counterparty of knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty with a view to give preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. If a Dutch court found that the granting of a guarantee or security interest or any other transaction entered into by the Issuer or a Guarantor at any time in connection with the Notes involved a fraudulent transfer as set out above, then the granting of a guarantee or security interest or any other transaction entered into by the Issuer or a Guarantor could be nullified. In the case of successful challenge, holders of the Notes would not enjoy the benefit of such guarantee or security interests. It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created on collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title thereto. It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created, in respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private limited liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register.

If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital (kapitaal/capital), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed. As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. The filing of the petition does not, however, have a suspensory effect if the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than six months ago (unless the court decides otherwise). The Belgian Insolvency Act provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will examine such petition, and within eight days following such examination and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial trustee in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to twelvemonths as from the start of the moratorium period. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six months. Special rules apply when a debtor has already requested and obtained a judicial reorganization procedure in the last three years before the new request. The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to preexisting claims (i.e., for debts incurred before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization procedure) in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period. Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immovable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued. If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the “Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in the Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse ----- of right). In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d’entreprise) to facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its assets or its activities. In addition, upon request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or one of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, the court may appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice). Finally, in the event of manifestly gross error of the debtors or one of its corporate bodies, the court may replace them with a temporary administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) for the duration of the moratorium. The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity where the creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Act provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15 day period following the notification of such default after granting of the moratorium. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations. The Belgian Insolvency Act provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of) the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and/or third parties. In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed. Such in court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. The court order confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it. In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The reorganization ----- plan must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not, although only limited measures can be imposed by such reorganization plan on secured creditors without their individual consent. The court may refuse ratification if the formalities were not complied with, or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public policy. To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following the ruling declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with preexisting claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure. In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan. The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the court appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be based on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. The court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The court ordered transfer will be organized by a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will be limited to the transfer price, subject to some limited exceptions. On 21 March 2021, the Belgian Parliament adopted a new act amending the Belgian Insolvency Act introducing a number of new measures, most notably a “pre-packaged insolvency” (voorbereidend _akkoord/accord préparatoire) (the “Pre-Pack”) procedure, where the debtor may discretely prepare for_ judicial reorganization proceedings under the supervision of a judicial administrator. These measures were initially adopted for a limited period ending on 30 June 2021. Pursuant to a Royal Decree those measures were extended until 16 July 2022. On 3 June 2022, it was decided by the Council of Ministers to further extend the measures until 31 December 2022. The purpose of the Pre-Pack is to confidentially test the possibility of an amicable or collective arrangement with a debtor’s most important creditors prior to formal insolvency proceedings. This occurs during a Pre-pack phase, i.e. a court supervised preparatory negotiation phase. If the negotiations in this Pre-pack phase are successful, the Pre-pack phase will be converted into the formal judicial reorganization proceedings (aimed at obtaining either an amicable agreement with two or more creditors, or a collective reorganization agreement that is approved by the majority of creditors representing the majority of the claims and binding on dissenting creditors). ----- The Pre-pack consists of the following features. A debtor may initiate the Pre-pack procedure by filing a petition with the President of the competent enterprise court, substantiating that its continuity is at risk immediately or in the short term. To ensure confidentiality, the petition is “unilateral” (meaning that creditors are not summoned to share their views on the petition) and will be decided upon by the President in a hearing behind closed doors (held within 8 days from the date of the petition). The subsequent decision of the President is not published in the Belgian Official Gazette. Opposition by third parties is not possible. If the President decides to refuse the Pre-pack petition, the debtor may appeal such decision within 8 business days after being notified of that decision. If the President decides to approve the Pre-pack petition, the President will appoint a judicial administrator. After the appointment of the judicial administrator (which is not published), the debtor must produce a list of creditors and disclose such list to the judicial administrator. The judicial administrator will subsequently assist the debtor in negotiating an amicable agreement, or a collective restructuring plan with either all or some of the creditors. During the Pre-pack phase, the debtor remains in control and may terminate the Pre-pack procedure at any time. If the negotiations conducted by the judicial administrator are successful, the President of the enterprise court will refer the matter to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court for the formal opening of judicial reorganization proceedings. Subsequently, an amicable agreement might be sanctioned (“homologated”) by the court, or the collective restructuring plan might be put to the creditors’ vote. Once referred, the judicial reorganization proceedings are carried out in an expedited manner. Within 5 business days after referral, the enterprise court will initiate formal judicial reorganization proceedings. In the event of an amicable agreement, the enterprise court will decide on confirming or rejecting the amicable settlement within one month. In the event of a collective restructuring agreement, the creditors will vote on a restructuring plan and the court will decide on confirming or rejecting the collective agreement within 3 months. At the request of the judicial administrator, during the Pre-pack procedure, the President of the enterprise court may subject unwilling or malicious creditors to payment terms and/or payment conditions as well as stay enforcement measures for a maximum period of four months. As soon as the matter is referred to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court, the debtor-company will enjoy the full suspension period (moratorium) offered by the formal judicial reorganization proceedings (i.e., during which enforcement measures against the company’s assets – for debts incurred before the opening of the judicial reorganization proceedings – will be suspended).",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,24,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,24.3,Belgium,24.3.3,Bankruptcy,"Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the public prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of “main insolvency proceedings” opened in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification. Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te ----- _betalen/cessation de paiements de manière persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that_ the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they fall due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business. The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may only decide not to continue performance of one or several ongoing contracts when the administration of the estate requires this and such decisions will not impair any rights in rem of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The other party to an ongoing contract may demand the receiver to take a decision within fifteen days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. If the receiver decides not to continue performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the fifteen days term, the other party to the contract may be entitled to claim damages, in which case its claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors. The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contract. As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de _la masse)._ For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the ----- mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period. If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings. As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security. The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a general overview of only the main principles: - _Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so called “estate debts,” have senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. - _Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization). - _Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests. - _Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank _pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated). - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue. The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case by case basis by reference to the prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross stream guarantees and collateral. It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member’s corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met. Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board of directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of directors will be subject to only a “marginal review” by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view. ----- If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable under civil law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse of company goods” (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or security interest could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest could be held liable if the corporate benefit requirement is not met and the creditor knew or should have known this. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor will be limited accordingly. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit. The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company must also be within or serve the corporate purpose and statutory purpose of the Belgian company as described in its articles of association.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte). The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due, and (iv) security interests provided for preexisting debts (save for any security granted during the suspension period of judicial reorganization proceedings). ----- Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment. In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced or at an undervalue, (ii) if the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the Belgian Guarantor’s cessation of payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure preexisting debts. If the guarantee or security interests granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on the above), noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the security interests. Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a Third-party creditor may obtain a court ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana). Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also be declared ineffective against third parties, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of the deed and the date of registration.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

In the event of an insolvency of a Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its “center of main interests” in Germany (the “German Guarantors”) at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law (subject to certain exceptions for particular matters under the EU Insolvency Regulation). Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. See “—European Union.” The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ----- ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a certain forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). The forecast horizon is four months for the period until December 31, 2023 and 12 months thereafter, whereby a debtor testing over indebtedness after the end of August 2023 may need to take into account whether over indebtedness occurs immediately after the four months forecast horizon as a consequence of the then applicable 12 months horizon. If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over indebtedness, the management board or managing director(s) of such company and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not later than: (i) three weeks after such illiquidity or; (ii) eight weeks (from January 1, 2024: six weeks) after such over-indebtedness occurred or (as the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claim risks as well as sanction risks under criminal law. A debtor is not considered over indebted even when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets if, given the circumstances, it is more likely than not that the debtor’s business can survive as a going concern. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and_ when they fall due at some point in time within a prognosis period of usually 24 months, whereas imminent illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over indebted (Überschuldung) it may also file for preliminary “debtor in possession” moratorium proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor in possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business. Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise ----- the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), whilst in debtor-in-possession proceedings, the debtor’s management retains the right to manage business. However, the court may also order that certain disposals of the debtor may require the preliminary trustee’s (vorläufiger Sachwalter) consent also in debtor-in-possession proceedings. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three requirements: (a) a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted); (b) revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or (c) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for “debtor in possession” proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung); and appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorläufiger) _Sachwalter). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if_ certain formal requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebted and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Unless the court has granted debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. Individual creditors, or the debtor, can request the insolvency court to remove the insolvency administrator only on the grounds of a lack of impartiality and only within six months from the appointment. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings, the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate ----- (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor including the Note Guarantees. The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the _Restructuring Directive”)._ For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings against the any Guarantor’s subject to the German insolvency regime would include the following: (a) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the (preliminary) insolvency administrator ((vorläufiger) _Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; (b) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; (c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (d) claims against any Guarantors may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and (e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene _Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the_ insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can ----- instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question. That having been said, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) viewed the insolvency administrator competent to realize pledged shares in a corporation that have been certificated (verbrieft) and are held in a custodian account (Depot) in Germany in case (i) the shares represent more than 20% in the issued share capital of the pledged company and (ii) the shareholder rights remain with the debtor. It therefore appears likely that in such a case, secured creditors would not be held competent to realize the respective share pledges. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9% (or more as agreed upon individually, but in any case at least 4%) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members of the creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the extent not satisfied after enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes). If a German Guarantor or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes by the German Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator or, in debtor-in-possession proceedings, by the trustee (upon instruction of the preliminary creditors’ committee or the creditors’ meeting) and which requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. The insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain conditions (cramdown) in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) under certain conditions. The insolvency plan ----- (Insolvenzplan) may also derogate from other provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In particular, it may contain provisions regarding the discharge of secured and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create, modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is a corporate entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the partnership interests in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency plan, including an issuance of shares or partnership interests to third parties or to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions, inter alia, regarding the Notes or the Note Guarantees or the Collateral which are less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the release of the Collateral or the release of obligations under the Notes or the Note Guarantees. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt to equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt to equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt to equity swap. An insolvency plan can further provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other security interests provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor affiliates being required to become subject of the debtor’s or separate insolvency proceedings, provided that the relevant debtor affiliate consents to the impairment. Creditors affected by such impairment are entitled to receive adequate compensation. This means that the claims under the Note Guarantees can get impaired if the Issuer or a Guarantor would enter into German insolvency proceedings, regardless of whether or not the relevant Guarantor is itself subject of insolvency proceedings. Under certain conditions, the debtor may also file for protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. As a general principle, the claims arising from a guarantee may be enforced against a German Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer. However, the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) has provisions to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. Whereas these provisions do not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, they stipulate four key measures in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppengerichtsstand); (ii) a single person may be appointed as insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) for all relevant group companies; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court (Koordinationsgericht). As a general principle, the claims arising from the Note Guarantees may be enforced against a Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the relevant Guarantor. Any insolvency proceedings over the assets of a Guarantor would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause other Guarantors or other affiliated companies to subsequently file for insolvency. ----- German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the Trustee being considered in a “shareholder like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims arising from a Guarantee would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. The Act for the Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate the Consequences of Crises, which was adopted in March 27, 2020 (as amended from time to time, originally the “COVInsAG” and now the “SanInsKG”) suspends, inter alia, the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for by September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans: (i) that were granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020; or (ii) were granted between October 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 if the debtor was overindebted but not illiquid; or (iii) were granted between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021 if the debtor had submitted an application for applicable German state aid between 1 November 2020 and 28 February 2021 (or, if an application was not possible due to legal or actual reasons, and the debtor was otherwise eligible for the applicable German state aid) unless there were no reasonable prospects to receive the applicable German state aid or if receiving the applicable German state aid would not have been sufficient to prevent insolvency. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,24,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,24.4,Germany,24.4.2,Preventive restructuring framework,"The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG). In transforming the EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019 into national law, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has come into force on January 1, 2021 in Germany. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a new pre-insolvency procedure to restructure the liabilities of debtors, whose “centre of main interest” is located in Germany. This may apply as of the date of this offering memorandum to certain of the Guarantors as well as to the Issuer. As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, little corresponding (court) practice exists as of the date of this offering memorandum and consequently any proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come with uncertainty. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of restructuring proceedings by a Relevant German Entity having its “centre of main interest” in Germany would be in particular the following: - potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings; - any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the restructuring plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Notes) ----- with a majority of 75% of the claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down by other classes under certain presumptions; - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to restructuring proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims, or, if applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a moratorium. _Restructuring proceedings_ Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the competent restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible to file for restructuring proceedings if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig). Such imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due within a two years’ look-forward period. During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business manager, which includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular, the debtor has to refrain from any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel). This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be subject to the envisaged restructuring plan, must not be settled or collateralized during the restructuring proceedings. During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor becomes illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However, if such an insolvency event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly without undue delay. The restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion, (i) the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all creditors or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over- indebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused by the enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to the restructuring plan provided the achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains predominantly likely. Once restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor is again obliged to file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If (i) the envisaged restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium enterprises or respective collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a moratorium against all or essentially all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for specific supervision of the settlement of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to appoint a mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A mandatory restructuring officer is also to be appointed by the restructuring court if the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) can predictably only be achieved by a cram-down of dissenting classes (unless only claims originated by financial institutions and/ or shareholders are to be compromised). The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) any person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is suitable for the respective individual case and who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or has comparable qualifications (an “Eligible Restructuring Officer”); the court may take suggestions by the debtor, creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is, based on expert opinion provided by an Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see “—Moratorium”), or (ii) creditors of one class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose a mandatory restructuring officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different from the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is evidently inadequate. If a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the debtor or a group of ----- creditors, the restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory restructuring officer in its own discretion. The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the procedure to be elected for the voting on the restructuring plan and can be empowered by the restructuring court to (i) supervise the debtor’s board and business situation and (ii) receive payments to and approve payments made by the debtor. If a moratorium is granted, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to monitor that the respective prerequisites of such moratorium persist and, in case such prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file for a lifting of such moratorium. Additionally, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the proposed plan’s prospects to remove the debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and restore the debtor’s viability. The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties independently and the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory restructuring officer. The restructuring court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from office for good cause ex officio or, if the mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition. Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of an optional restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan. Creditors may only request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the costs of the optional restructuring officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support the stakeholders involved in the negotiations of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An optional restructuring officer can also be removed from office by the restructuring court ex officio for good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition. Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may terminate the restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g., if the debtor notifies the restructuring court of the occurrence of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking into account the actual status of the relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal insolvency proceedings is obviously not in the interest of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor files for insolvency or insolvency proceedings are opened over the assets of the debtor based on a creditor’s filing. _Restructuring plan_ Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan, which can comprise certain selected or all (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of financial and other agreements to which more than the debtor and one other party are parties, including the terms and liabilities relating to the relevant debtor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and undue claims, and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and intercreditor agreements can be amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted under a restructuring plan, provided that affected creditors are adequately compensated. Consequently, the Notes or the Note Guarantees could also be subject to a restructuring plan provided the respective debtor has its “centre of main interest” in Germany. Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law measures like a share-capital increase. Debt-to-equity swaps can be implemented without the ----- shareholders’ consent but require the willingness of at least certain creditors to equitize their debt claims as no creditor can be forced to take equity as a consideration under a restructuring plan. Hence, if, the Notes or the Note Guarantees were subject to a restructuring plan providing for debt-to-equity swap, single holders of the Notes could not be forced under the restructuring plan to take equity in the Issuer or a Guarantor without their respective consent. The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed by the restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a (virtual) creditors’ meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the respective creditors’ economic interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors, unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors (e.g., shareholders) will form separate classes. However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings, could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by value of all claims of one class will be required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity requirement. Dissenting classes can be crammed down (or up), if - the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the plan than absent the plan (whereby the alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent liquidation, but can also be an alternative out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis); - the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan; and - a majority of classes has accepted the plan. A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan if (i) no other creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that would rank junior in insolvency proceedings, the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through the plan which is not covered by a respective stakeholder’s contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor that would rank pari _passu in insolvency proceedings receives a preferential treatment compared to the dissenting class under_ the restructuring plan (unless such preferential treatment is appropriate (sachgerecht) in light of the individual situation of distress to overcome and the dissenting class accounts for no more than 50% of the rank’s total claims). However, despite the prerequisite described under (ii) in the foregoing sentence, a creditor class can also be crammed down in case a shareholder retains equity without any additional contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and bindingly committed to the continuation of the debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or the creditors’ rights are only compromised marginally (e.g., by a maturity extension of no more than 18 months). Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan. In case the voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected stakeholders before the plan can be confirmed. The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the procedure to adopt the restructuring plan or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured upon the restructuring court’s notice, (iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan can obviously be not satisfied by the debtor or (iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring concept is incoherent or appears to be based on incorrect facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success. Additionally, dissenting creditors can request the restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the applicant will be expectedly worse off under the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan and the applicant has already raised such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable. However, such application has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors that can prove to be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such funds. ----- Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they are able to produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the restructuring plan and funds provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not suffice for their individual compensation. Such appeal will only have suspensive effect (aufschiebende _Wirkung) against the effectiveness of the restructuring plan if requested by the dissenting creditor and_ ordered by the court based on serious and irreversible disadvantages for such dissenting creditor that are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate implementation of the restructuring plan. Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a German restructuring court in accordance with the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) are included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (as amended) and will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law. As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, any such recognition has not to our knowledge been tested as of the date of this offering memorandum. _Moratorium_ In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by the competent court upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors with regards to their payment claims or the realization of respective collateral over moveable assets. The moratorium can initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the moratorium up to a maximum of eight months permissible under certain conditions. Such moratorium may also be sanctioned with regards to collateral provided by the debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten). The moratorium does not suspend the relevant creditor’s interest claims. However, whereas creditors may still file an insolvency petition against the debtor during a moratorium, correspondingly initiated insolvency proceedings are suspended for the time of the moratorium. Under certain conditions, in particular if the requirements to terminate restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not comply with certain statutory duties under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) the competent court may lift the moratorium, also on a creditor’s application. _Limitations on Enforcement_ Some of the German Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—“GmbH”) and/or a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft— _“AG”) and/or European company (Europäische Gesellschaft, “SE”) incorporated under German law._ Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die _Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”), the German Stock Corporation Act_ (Aktiengesetz, “AktG”) and other laws. These provisions would also apply to any future German Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG), AG or SE. _GmbH Limitation Language_ As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves as determined under German generally accepted accounting principles) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital); in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, such provisions apply to the general partner which is a GmbH. The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries ----- to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner, such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Guarantee, the Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents provided by the German Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Note Guarantees, the Indenture and the Collateral is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. _AG Limitation Language_ As a general rule, Section 57 AktG prohibits the disbursement of the deposits to the stockholders (Verbot der Einlagenrückgewähr). In addition, pursuant to Section 71a AktG the relevant German AG or SE may not grant any loan or grant and security to a third party for purposes of the acquisition of the stock in such AG or SE. Any agreement in such respect is void. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Section 57 AktG and/or Section 71a AktG, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a German AG or SE. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of Section 57 AktG and/or Section 71a AktG. Accordingly, the Guarantee, the Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Note Guarantees and the Indenture is limited in the manner described below. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure —Corporate benefit, financial assistance _laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.” German limitation language_ The limitation language for any GmbH, GmbH & Co.

(iv) Any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by such AG Guarantor or by any Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to the extent: (A) an amount utilized under the Indenture is applied for the repayment, prepayment or other refinancing of any Financial Indebtedness of such AG Guarantor or Subsidiary of such AG Guarantor; and (B) such exception does not lead to a violation of § 57 (1) or § 71a AktG (in connection with § 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation, as applicable). (v) For the avoidance of doubt, the limits set out in this paragraph (b) shall no further apply from the date the relevant AG Guarantor is no longer incorporated as an AG unless such Guarantor is a Subsidiary of another AG Guarantor in which case this paragraph (b) shall apply in a way that the relevant Guarantor shall be treated as a Subsidiary of that other AG Guarantor in accordance with this paragraph (b). In such event, the limitations set out in this paragraph (b) shall not apply to the Limited Upstream Obligation granted by that Guarantor in respect of any liabilities which are owed by that other AG Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries. (b) _GmbH Guarantee Limitation Language (i) Save as set out in this paragraph (c), the Trustee shall not enforce, and any GmbH Guarantor (and/or the relevant subsidiary of a GmbH Guarantor) shall have a defence (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a discharge (Erfüllung) or enforcement (Vollstreckung) in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment to occur. (ii) The restrictions in paragraph (i) shall not apply: (A) if and to the extent the Limited Upstream Obligation of the GmbH Guarantor secures any indebtedness under any Notes Document in respect of: (1) amounts which are (directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant GmbH Guarantor or its Subsidiaries; or (2) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of any of the creditors of the GmbH Guarantor or the GmbH Guarantor's Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent that any such on-lending or otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of credit are still outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (ii) shall have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced multiple times (no double dip); (B) if, at the time of enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation, a DPLA (either directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer agreements) exists between the ----- [Issuer or the relevant Guarantors] whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation as dominating company (herrschendes Unternehmen) and the relevant GmbH Guarantor as a dominated company (beherrschtes Unternehmen), provided that: (1) the GmbH Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the [Issuer or the relevant Guarantors] whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or (2) the GmbH Guarantor and the [Issuer or the relevant Guarantors] whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company with such parent company as dominating entity (beherrschendes Unternehmen), in each case unless the mere existence of such DPLA does not lead to the inapplicability of § 30 (1) sentence 1 GmbHG; (C) if and to the extent any payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder _Rückgewähranspruch) of the GmbH Guarantor against the [Issuer or_ the relevant Guarantors] whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or (D) if the relevant GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below; however, if and to the extent that the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation has been enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this paragraph (c) because the Management Notification and/or the Auditor's Determination has not (or not in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below, but the Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within four months from its due date in accordance with paragraphs (iv) below, the Trustee shall upon demand of the GmbH Guarantor to the Trustee repay any amount received from the GmbH Guarantor which pursuant to the Auditor's Determination would not have been available for enforcement, if the Auditor's Determination had been delivered in a timely manner. (iii) If the relevant GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee within fifteen (15) Business Days after the making of a demand against that GmbH Guarantor under the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation: (A) to what extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or indemnity; and (B) to what extent a GmbH Capital Impairment would occur as a result of an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its GmbH Net Assets, providing an upto-date pro forma balance sheet), then the restrictions set out in paragraph (i) above shall cease to apply until a Management Notification has been provided. ----- (iv) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) Business Days of its receipt, request the relevant GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within forty-five (45) Business Days of receipt of such request a determination by the Auditors or any other auditors of international standard and reputation appointed by the GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail the amount in which the payment and/or enforcement under the Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment subject to the terms set out under this paragraph (c). Save for manifest errors, the Auditor's Determination shall be binding on all parties. (v) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor's Determination which prevented it from demanding any or only partial payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial conditions of the GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor's Determination has substantially improved, the Trustee (acting reasonably) may, at the GmbH Guarantor's cost and expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the GmbH Guarantor by applying the same principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor's Determination by the auditors who prepared the Auditor's Determination in order for such Auditors to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the GmbH Capital Impairment has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial condition of the GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor's Determination prior to the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor's Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent the Auditors determine that the GmbH Capital Impairment have been cured. (vi) The GmbH Net Assets shall be adjusted as follows: (A) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant GmbH Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant GmbH Guarantor became a party to this Agreement and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted from the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited under the Notes Documents and has been carried out without the prior written consent of the Trustee; (B) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 253 (6) HGB shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; (C) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 268 (8) HGB shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; (D) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 272 (5) HGB shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; and (E) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly negligent violation of the Notes Documents shall not be taken into account as liabilities. (vii) Where a GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) that the Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall realize, to the extent lawful and within reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a ----- book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and are not necessary for the relevant GmbH Guarantor's business (nicht _betriebsnotwendig)._ (c) _Liquidity Impairment Limitation Language (i) Save as set out in this paragraph (d), the Trustee shall not enforce, and any German Guarantor shall have a defence (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a payment and/or enforcement in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a Liquidity Impairment for such German Guarantor. (ii) Paragraphs (c)(iii), (c)(v), (c)(iv) and (c)(vii) above (including the repayment contemplated in (c)(ii)(D) above) shall apply _mutatis mutandis to the restriction in paragraph (i) above. (d) Where the provisions of this Clause apply to a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft), all references to the assets of a German Guarantor shall _mutatis mutandis include a reference to the assets of the general partner_ (Komplementär) of such limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft). (e) In addition to the restrictions set out in paragraphs (b) through (e) above, if a German Guarantor demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the payment under and/or enforcement of any Limited Upstream Obligation against such German Guarantor would result in personal liability of its managing director(s) (Geschäftsführer) or director(s) (Vorstände) for a reimbursement of payments made under any Limited Upstream Obligation (including, without limitation, pursuant to §30, 31, 43 GmbHG, §15 InsO, § 93 AktG and/or § 826 BGB), the German Guarantor shall have a defence (Einrede) against the Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent required in order not to incur such liability. (f) For the _avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by a German Guarantor or of any subsidiary of a German Guarantor in respect of any borrowing liabilities which are owed by German Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall not be limited under this Clause. (g) The restrictions set out in this Clause do not affect the rights of the Trustee to claim any outstanding amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent the restrictions set out in this Clause would allow such claim at that later point in time. (h) _Nothing in this Clause shall prevent the Trustee or a German Guarantor from claiming in court that payments under and/or an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligations do or do not fall within the scope of §§ 30, 31, 43 GmbHG, §§ 57, 71a, 93, 278 (3) AktG, § 15b (5) InsO, Art. 5 SE Regulation and/or § 826 BGB (as applicable). (i) Nothing in this Clause shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under the Indenture or any other Notes Document to the Trustee or any Noteholder or vice _versa._ (j) Each _reference in this Clause to a statutory provision shall be construed to be a reference to the relevant equivalent statutory provision (if any) as amended, re-enacted or replaced from time to time. (k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, this Clause and any rights and/or obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law.” ----- _General Comments regarding German Limitation Language_ German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect to Sections 30, 31 GmbHG, Section 15(b) InsO and Sections 57, 71a AktG), are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of, as applicable, an AG, a SE, a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors to make payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees or the enforceability of the Note Guarantees, the Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents relating to the Collateral (i.e., the share pledges and any other security interest) provided by the German Guarantors. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or other collateral granted by the German Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantee or any Collateral by the German Guarantors. The enforcement of security granted by a German Guarantor may also be excluded (entirely) in case the granting or enforcement of such security and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence of a claim by any so secured finance party under such security resulted or would result in any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to Section 15(b) InsO. Furthermore the beneficiary (for example, a holder of Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (for example, the provision or the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. _Parallel Debt; Security Interests_ Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, ----- and may not be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Transaction Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the creation of the parallel debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable by each obligor under, in particular, the Notes. The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt rather than the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt has not been tested under German law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure.” German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors). _Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the Restructuring Directive_ Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or in the event that debtor in possession status has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings, which would be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, trustee under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes or any collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the relevant collateral. If payments have already been made under the Notes or collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases,: (a) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) ----- at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing); whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; (b) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for the other creditors; (c) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; (d) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security (including a guarantee) for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings; (e) any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. For granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, such knowledge is (solely) presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) (as opposed to the knowledge of imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in regular cases) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other_ creditors. Apart from that, such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), may only be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing. There is a rebuttable presumption that, if the debtor reached a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the ----- creditor or the creditor granted any other form of deferred payment (Zahlungserleichterungen) to the debtor, he had no knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at the time of the transaction; (f) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘related party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; (g) any act that provides security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and (h) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a German Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. Knowledge of pending restructuring proceedings (see—“Preventive Restructuring Framework”) per se does not suffice for a creditor to be deemed to have such “knowledge”. A person is further deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If an insolvency creditor concluded a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. ----- Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Avoidance Act differ to a certain extent from the above described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. The provision of a security concurrently with the incurrence of debt funded as new money may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged. Meaning, under certain circumstances it may not be subject to avoidance rights under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg). According to recent caselaw of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however, this privilege does not apply to claims under a shareholder loan agreement or economically equivalent transactions as described above. Furthermore, any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan (see —“Preventive Restructuring _Framework”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete_ information presented by the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof. This privilege does not apply to shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral provided therefor. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable towards another creditor if (i) such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency (for which knowledge of pendent restructuring proceedings (see —“Preventive _Restructuring Framework”) per se does not suffice) at the time such funding was provided or extended_ or such security was granted and (ii) the other creditor suffered losses caused by a delayed filing for insolvency based on the additional or extended existing funding. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, e.g., the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. If, however, such was additional funding has been provided or existing funding has been extended or respective collateral has been granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain cases, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021), any such transaction is statutorily exempted from the lender liability concept as laid out above.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

These transactions may include over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

All these costs have been expensed within the income statement at the acquisition date. #### 3.1.2 Acquisitions in the prior year Please refer to the full year 2021 financial statements for an overview of the acquisitions done in 2021. #### 3.2 Acquisitions of joint ventures and associates In May 2022 ETA, a subsidiary of the Abylsen group, established a joint venture with DFI, which is a subcontractor ETA works with on specific projects. ETA holds 50% of the shares for an amount of EUR 0,03 million. The purpose of this investment is to reduce the amount of insurance expenses of the projects ETA and DFI are working on. No activity is planned in this joint venture until 2023. The Group acquired 3,6% additional shares in Happy Recruiter. Following this transaction the Group holds 38,6% of the shares in Happy Recruiter. Please refer to the full year 2021 financial statements for an overview of the acquisitions of joint ventures and associates done in 2021. #### 3.3 Acquisition of non-controlling interest On 23 June 2022 Newco Abylsen acquired 35,07% additional shares in Newco Greenworking for a price of EUR 9,83 million. Following this transaction Newco Abylsen holds 95,07% of the shares in Newco Greenworking. Please refer to the full year 2021 financial statements for an overview of the transactions with noncontrolling interests in 2021. Changes in the non-controlling interests in the Group’s ownership interest after control is obtained, that do not result in a change in control of the subsidiary, have been accounted for within equity. Therefore, no gain or loss in the income statement on selling the subsidiary’s shares has been recognized, neither any additional goodwill has been reflected when acquiring additional shares. Instead, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest has been adjusted to reflect the change in the ownership interest in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in equity and attributed to the Group’s equity holders. ----- ### 4 Financial risk management Fair value estimation The majority of financial assets and liabilities are classified as assets/liabilities at amortized cost, except for derivatives which are measured at the fair value through profit or loss. Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently carried at amortized cost, for which any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The Group does not hold material financial instruments at fair value. The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured or disclosed at fair value at 30 September 2022 and 31 December 2021: The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments. For most of the borrowings, the fair values are not materially different to their carrying amounts since the interest payable on those borrowings is either close to current market rates or the borrowings are of a short-term nature. The difference in the above table for the bank loans is due to paid transaction costs and the derivative financial asset that are reflected in the net book value, under the amortized cost method. ----- ### 5 Management judgements and estimates Preparing interim financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires management to make judgements and estimates and to use assumptions that may significantly influence the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the notes on contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We refer to our annual report 2021. ### 6 Seasonality The Group’s revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations in many of the markets where they operate. The Group has in the past experienced and expects in the future to experience fluctuations in the results of operations due to seasonal demand in their current markets. Seasonality means that the Group’s results vary from quarter to quarter, and therefore the results of one quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Seasonality varies depending on a number of different factors, including the business units, the operating segments, the underlying industry sector served, including delays in the construction industry due to weather or otherwise, the nature of any seasonal work during a specific period, such as the weeks before Christmas and Easter, as well as around harvest time in the food production sector or around holiday periods, including Christmas and summer holidays. Historically, revenue fluctuates, with higher levels of revenue typically being received in the second half of the year just after summer holidays with an additional decrease in December due to Christmas holidays. Due to this seasonality effect, the Group does not expect their Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements to be reflective of the results they anticipate for the year ending December 31, 2022. ----- ### 7 Segment reporting As from 2021 the Group only presents two segments (instead of three previously) to reflect the integration of the General and Specialized Staffing segments into the Specialized Talent Solutions segment which occurred in the course of Q1 2021. This integration has been materialized through the successful completion of the partial merger between TimePartner and Zaquensis in Q2 2021. This segment reporting also reflects better the strategy of House of HR towards becoming even more specialized in the Human Resources solutions market. The final purpose of this segmentation is to better focus on how to attract candidates and present the services to our client base. - **Specialized Talent Solutions: The Specialized Talent Solutions segment provides on the one hand temporary staffing solutions with a focus on ‘temp-to-perm’ placements, international job candidate recruiting and permanent placements for clients who need specific job profiles, and on the other hand (mostly) short-term staffing solutions to larger clients with multiple staffing needs. - **Engineering & Consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving sectors like energy, pharmaceuticals, technology etc. The Group also assists clients with the search and selection of the right candidate, interim management or secondment. Corporate management is responsible for managing performance, underlying risks, and effectiveness of operations. The table below shows the segment information provided to the strategic steering committee for the reportable segments for the first nine months ended 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2021 and the basis on which revenue is recognized. ----- Segment balance sheet and segment income statement are presented before elimination of intersegment transactions. Sales between segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. The group eliminations for the nine months ended 30 September 2022 contain the LTIP expenses of EUR 3,54 million (refer to the equity roll-forward table and note 21), the elimination of EUR 24,98 million dividend paid by Accent Construct to House of HR and the elimination of EUR 10,00 million dividend paid by Redmore Group to House of HR. The group eliminations for the nine months ended 30 September 2021 contain the LTIP expense of EUR 1,21 million (refer to the equity roll and note 21), the elimination of EUR 1,04 million dividend paid by Accent Group to House of HR and the elimination of EUR 6,76 million plus value on the sale of shares in Gighouse and Nowjobs from Accent to House of Invest. ----- ### 8 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant & equipment increased by EUR 53,82 million during the first nine months of the accounting period. Movement in property, plant & equipment relate mainly to the acquisitions done (EUR 22,45 million, mainly relating to leases) and the lease contracts (EUR 30,23 million) as the net book value is impacted by new contracts signed or prolongment of current contracts. ### 9 Intangible assets Intangible assets increased by EUR 135,15 million during the first nine months of the accounting period. This fluctuation results mainly from the acquisitions: - SOLCOM for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 14,36 million and EUR 66,59 million respectively, - TMI for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 7,30 million and EUR 52,93 million respectively, - Vijverberg for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 0,41 million and EUR 1,45 million respectively, - Sira Consulting for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 0,11 million and EUR 0,62 million respectively, - Bis People for which customer relationships are valued at EUR 1,50 million, no value is allocated to the brand name as it will not be used by the Group, - StaffMe for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 0,87 million and EUR 2,53 million respectively, - Locum Doctors for which customer relationships are valued at EUR 8,92 million. As from 2023 Avanti and Locum Doctors will go to the market as a new House of HR German Healthcare Powerhouse using the brand of Avanti, as such no value is allocated to the brand name of Locum Doctors. - FID for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 0,48 million and EUR 3,50 million respectively. The increase is partially compensated by the amortization charges on brand names and customer relationships of EUR 31,83 million. ### 10 Goodwill Goodwill has increased by EUR 212,60 million and is highly impacted by the acquisitions: - SOLCOM for which a goodwill of EUR 101,96 million has been recorded in the Engineering and Consulting segment, - Atrium for which a goodwill of EUR 2,43 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent Solutions segment, - TMI for which a goodwill of EUR 42,70 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent Solutions segment,, - BE-Consult for which a goodwill of EUR 2,10 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent Solutions segment,, - Vijverberg for which a goodwill of EUR 2,01 million has been recorded in the Engineering and Consulting segment, - Sira Consulting for which a goodwill of EUR 0,83 million has been recorded in the Engineering and Consulting segment, - Bis People for which a goodwill of EUR 3,45 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent Solutions segment, ----- - StaffMe for which a goodwill of EUR 19,64 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent Solutions segment, - Locum Doctors for which a goodwill of EUR 43,08 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent Solutions segment, and - FID for which a goodwill of EUR 7,71 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent Solutions segment. An impairment test is annually performed based on Q3 interim financial statements. However, during Q2 2022, the rising interest rates have been considered as an impairment indicator. Consequently, an impairment test has been performed as per 30 June 2022. Except for GRITT, no goodwill impairment has been identified. With regard to GRITT, part of the Engineering and Consulting Segment, the recoverable amount amounted to EUR 40,93 million, compared to a carrying value of EUR 54,23 million. Although the results of GRITT are in line with the budgeted results, the change in WACC has impacted the recoverable amount negatively. Considering the current market conditions, this change is considered to be long-term and a goodwill impairment of EUR 13,30 million has been recorded. As interests rates increased further during Q3 2022 another impairment test has been performed as per 30 September 2022. The carrying amount of GRITT, amount to EUR 40,93 million including the impairment of EUR 13,30 million is in line with the recoverable amount. As such, no further impairment has been recorded. The value in use is calculated using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year window. Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate. This growth rate is consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to the industry in which each CGU operates.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

The group holds one financial asset at fair value through P&L of which the value at 30 September 2022 is 0, please refer to note 13. ### 12 Other non-current assets Other non-current assets increased by EUR 0,57 million which is mainly related to: - The asset deal of sociaal.nl which includes a bank guarantee of EUR 0,50 million, - House of Finance granted EUR 0,54 million loans to the managers of SOLCOM to allow them to invest in future capital increases of House of HR, - GRITT Projects repaid its loan to the Group for an amount of EUR 1,15 million, and - Increase of long term warranties related to buildings following the increase of lease contracts. ----- ### 13 Derivative financial instruments A derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to an embedded derivative – the right for the issuer to exercise an early payment option. As this option is not considered to be closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized and has been measured at the fair value on initial recognition with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. The prepayment option relating to the Senior (Un)Secured Notes is valued using financial models available in Bloomberg. The value of the option feature is equal to the difference between the bond price observed on the market and the estimated bond price if there was no redemption option. It is then adjusted to capture the impact of the costs of refinancing. The main parameters of the analysis are the bond price, the volatility of interest rates and the net book value of the refinancing fees. At year-end 2021 the value of the derivative financial asset amounted to EUR 3,03 million. Since Q1 2022 the derivative is valued at 0. The difference in fair value has been recorded in the income statement. ### 14 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables increased by EUR 118,14 million, mainly influenced by the acquisitions done (EUR 46,94 million) and increased sales. Next to that, EUR 37,45 million increase relates to the estimated sales of Covebo and the timing difference of the trade receivables balance between Covebo closing date 11 September 2022 and 30 September 2022. Forward-looking information has been considered in assessing the Expected Credit Loss impairment under IFRS 9, taking into consideration the possible downside resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. This did not result in a significant impact on the ECL model assumptions. Other receivables increased by EUR 20,51 million, influenced by - EUR 2,39 million increase in advance invoices received and paid during the first half of the year which are deferred over the full year, mainly concerning the accident insurance in TimePartner which is paid in advance as from 2022, - The increase in VAT receivable balance of EUR 1,60 million, - EUR 2,63 million increase of grants to be received, related to the build-up of grants to be received for the year 2022, - EUR 2,20 million increase in contract assets - EUR 1,40 million receivable towards former shareholders of Cohedron for a tax claim, and - EUR 14,41 million increased receivables from the factoring company, of which EUR 2,27 million is relating to the newly acquired group SOLCOM. The difference between the gross trade receivable sold and the amount received from the factoring company is recorded as other receivables. The increase in this balance is in line with the increase in the trade receivables. SOLCOM had a factoring contract in place at the moment of acquisition. In the course of Q2 2022 this contract has been terminated and SOLCOM has been integrated into the factoring agreement of the Group. - These movements are partly offset by a decrease of EUR 4,36 million withholding tax reductions related to 2021 that have been received in Accent Construct. There is no build-up for 2022 since the withholding tax reductions are now settled on a net basis with the withholding tax charges, and - The repayment of the loan that was given to GRITT Projects for an amount of EUR 2,33 million. ----- ### 15 Income tax Income tax expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2022 is 291,4%, compared to 40,6% for the nine months ended 30 September 2021. The average annual tax rate is highly impacted by the losses of Corporate (EUR 64,55 million, excluding non-taxable dividend income of EUR 34,98 million, as per 30 September 2022 compared to EUR 18,81 million, excluding non-taxable dividend income of EUR 1,04 million, as per 30 September 2021) and the impairment recorded in 2022 (refer to note 10). Excluding these losses the average annual tax rate amounts to 32,1% for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 30,2% for the first nine months of 2021. The increase in the deferred tax liabilities (EUR 32,99 million) is in line with the deferred taxes on the brand names and customer relationships, partially offset by the revaluation of the early repayment option and the depreciation and amortization recorded on the customer relationships, brand names and the refinancing fees. Deferred tax assets are mainly impacted by a decrease of EUR 1,10 million of the deferred tax asset on the losses of Avanti recorded in 2021. ### 16 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased by EUR 33,39 million. Refer to the consolidated cash flow statement. The cash and cash equivalents include EUR 21,01 million of restricted cash. These deposits are subject to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands (system of G-accounts containing amounts for taxes to be paid on salaries) or relate to deposits for buildings/branches and are therefore not available for general use by the other entities within the Group. ### 17 Equity The authorized share capital and share premium of the Group as per 30 September 2022 amounts to EUR 337,90 million and is composed of 535.553.717 shares. In March 2022 House of HR proceeded with a capital increase in order to allow the existing shareholders to invest in House of HR pro-rata their existing shareholding, and to allow the managers of the recently acquired entity SOLCOM and other managers to become a shareholder. The capital increase amounted to EUR 32,07 million and EUR 5,83 million presented by 17.856.556 shares. An additional capital increase took place in June 2022 to allow the managers of the recently acquired group TMI and the entities Vijverberg and Sira Consulting to become a shareholder. The capital increase amounted to EUR 33,28 million presented by 15.955.572 shares. ----- Next to the capital increases, the equity in 2022 is impacted by the buy-out of minority shareholders in Newco Greenworking (refer to note 3.3) and the acquisition of StaffMe of which 29,2% of the shares relate to minority shareholders. The changes in equity for the first six months of 2021 are related to a capital increase of EUR 20,81 million, the acquisition of Greenworking, of which 40% of the shares relate to minority shareholders, the acquisition of Avanti, of which 11% of the shares relate to minority shareholders, and the buy-out of the minorities (1,16% of the shares) in Mykelson. ### 18 Borrowings The bank loans were initially measured at fair value, with subsequent measurement at amortized cost. Fluctuations in these bank loans result from the amortization of the refinancing fees. The Group did not have any loan default or breach of any loan agreements during the first nine months of 2022. Thanks to the deleveraging achieved along 2021, an additional Term Loan B add-on facility of EUR 190,00 million was successfully completed in the market as per 3 February 2022. The funds will be used to support M&A activities of House of HR. At the same time, House of HR also successfully increased its Revolving Credit Facility from EUR 100,00 million to EUR 125,00 million. The refinancing expenses attributable to these transactions are capitalized as part of the loan and are being depreciated over the lifetime of the loan. As per February 19, 2021 the Group has successfully repriced their Senior Facility Agreement, resulting in a 50 BPS reduction. The total impact of the repricing amounts to EUR 13,07 million saving for the Group. Total financing expenses for this repricing are capitalized as part of the bank borrowings and are being depreciated over the remaining lifetime of the loan. On 28 May 2022, the Group announced that Bain Capital Private Equity – one of the world’s leading private investment firms – has entered into a share purchase agreement for the acquisition of a 55% stake in the Group. Management, Naxicap and Conny Vandendriessche will hold the remaining equity. The new strategic partnership will maintain the Company's entrepreneurial spirit, help the Group scale its unique platform into new markets and increase digital investments. ----- As a result of this transaction the company's existing Term Loan B, Senior Secured Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes will be refinanced. A group of financial institutions committed to provide a debt financing package in support of Bain Capital's acquisition of a majority stake in House of HR but the closing of the transaction was not finalized as per 30 September 2022. On 3 November 2022 the deal has been closed, refer to the subsequent events (note 32) for more information. As based on contractual terms a mandatory early repayment in the current loan agreement is only triggered upon change of control, which will occur upon closing of the deal, the classification of the borrowings is not impacted by the share purchase agreement and is considered as long term as per 30 September 2022. ### 19 Provisions for other liabilities and charges Provisions have increased by EUR 2,10 million. These relate to the acquisitions done (EUR 0,67 million) and for a large part to the sickness provision (EUR 0,42 million), which increased as sickness strongly increased since Covid-19. Next to that a provision of EUR 0,16 million has been recorded related to the Long Term Incentive Plan signed for Book’U on 31 March 2022. ### 20 Employee benefit obligations Employee benefit obligations increased by EUR 36,14 million. The increase relates to the acquisitions done (EUR 17,39 million), timing of payment of the salaries, impacted also by the period end date of Covebo closing (EUR 29,39 million), and the build-up of holiday pay, year-end premium and bonus accruals on the other hand, partly offset by the pay-out of bonuses and holiday pay in 2022. ### 21 Share-based payments The LTIP is comprised of 100 million share options, of which 75 million are granted during 2018, 12,5 million during 2019 and 12,5 million during 2021. The share options are granted free of charge at the grant date. The fair value per share option at grant date in 2018 amounted to EUR 2,17 compared to the exercise price of EUR 1,53 after the capital reduction of 2020. For the options granted in 2019, the fair value per share amounted to EUR 1,33 and for the ones granted in 2021 EUR 1,63. The value of the option shares has been determined based on an EBITDA-multiple model (correcting for net debt) and is recognized in income statement based on the exit probability. Following the agreement with Bain Capital the share options are expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the remaining value is recognized in the income statement over the remaining expected lifetime. As the expected volatility of the people included in the plan has no impact on the total value, no assumption was made in this respect. On 31 March 2022 an LTIP has been signed for Book’U, in which 7.279 share options have been granted. Based on the estimated pay-out in 2027, when the plan ends, a provision of EUR 0,16 million has been recorded. ### 22 Trade and other payables Trade payables and other payables have increased by EUR 31,87 million, mainly impacted by the acquisitions done in 2022 (EUR 30,06 million). ----- ### 23 Other liabilities Other liabilities have increased by EUR 68,15 million which is mainly impacted by: - EUR 49,39 million increase of the lease liability, of which EUR 19,37 million is relating to the new acquisitions, - The earn-out of TMI of EUR 4,71 million, the earn-out of EUR 0,45 million of Atrium, the earn-out of EUR 1,00 million of BE-Consult, the earn-out of EUR 7,00 million of StaffMe, the earn-out of EUR 3,00 million of Locum Doctors, EUR 1,21 million increase in the estimated earn-out of Avanti, -EUR 1,89 million payment of the earn-out of TechMatch and -EUR 0,63 million payment of the earn-out of Bevebo, - An increase of EUR 10,00 million related to the part of the acquisition price of Locum Doctors that will be reinvested, - An increase in the VAT payable of EUR 6,16 million, - Partly offset by EUR 13,4 million decrease in the interest accrual due to the timing of interest payments done by House of Finance. ### 24 Revenues Revenue of the Group consists of the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the services rendered during the year to third parties. The Group mainly derives revenue from the transfer of services over time and at a point in time in the following geographical regions and lines of services: The group has no customers that represent more than 10% of the overall turnover. ### 25 Cost of Services, Selling expenses, Other general and administrative expenses Expenses have remained stable compared to the first nine months of last year, with cost of services at 73,69% of sales in the current year compared to 74,02% in 2021, selling expenses at 13,99% in the current year compared to 13,66% in 2021, and other general and administrative expenses at 6,18% in the current year compared to 5,61% in 2021. ### 26 Depreciation, amortization and impairment of PP&E and Intangible assets Depreciation and amortization expenses have increased in the first nine months of the current year (EUR 91,43 million) compared to the first nine months of the previous year (EUR 64,45 million). This increase is related to amortization on the brand names and customer relationships of EUR 12,48 million, and for the remaining part mainly related to the depreciation charges in newly acquired entities (EUR 9,75 million). ----- ### 27 Other gains and losses The other gains and losses mainly relate to the increase in estimated earn-out of Avanti of EUR -1,21 million and TMI of EUR -0,65 million. ### 28 Finance result Finance income mainly includes interest income on short-term bank deposits. Finance expenses mainly include the interest on borrowings from banks, the amortization of the refinancing costs (refer to note 18), the fair value adjustment on the embedded derivative (refer to note 13) and expenses related to credit insurance and commercial finance. Based on an updated scenario (refer to note 18) the amortized cost of the borrowings was adjusted. Hence, in the first nine months of 2022 there are EUR 18,16 million fees recorded related to the bank borrowings. ### 29 Contingencies There are no material changes in the contingent liabilities and contingent assets since the latest published financial statements as per 31 December 2021. ### 30 Commitments There are no material changes in the commitments since the latest published financial statements as per 31 December 2021. The Group does not have material commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as per 30 September 2022. ### 31 Related parties Refer to note 3 on the acquisition of new groups in 2022.

Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. _Conclusion_ Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying consolidated condensed financial information as of 30 September 2022 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial reporting as adopted by the European Union.

Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Under IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. Joint operations The Group recognizes its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings. The Group does not have any joint operations as per 31 December 2021. Joint ventures Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see below), after initially being recognized at cost in the consolidated statement of financial position. Refer to note 3.2. for an overview of the Group’s joint ventures. ----- Equity method Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in note 2.11. A joint arrangement operates in the same way as other entities, except that a contractual arrangement between the Group and other ventures establishes joint control over the economic activity of the entity. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Under IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. Joint operations The Group recognizes its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings. The Group does not have any joint operations as per 31 December 2020.

When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,284,M&A,284.27,2.5 Business Combinations,284.27.1,,"The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the: - fair values of the assets transferred; - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business; - equity interests issued by the Group; - fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The excess of the: - consideration transferred; - amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and - acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date.

Because of the Belgian legislation applicable to the second pillar pension plans (the so-called “Wet op de Aanvullende Pensioenen”), all Belgian pension plans that are structured as defined contribution plans are considered defined benefit plans under IFRS. Because of this minimum guaranteed return, the employer is exposed to a financial risk since further contributions could be required if the return on the assets is not sufficient to reach the minimum benefits to be paid. The Company has plans that are financed through insurance contracts. The projected unit credit method has been used as the actuarial technique to measure the defined benefit obligation. The related assumptions, the defined benefit obligation and related plan assets are further disclosed in Note 18. Defined benefit plans The Group does not offer defined benefit plans to its staff. For the specific situation on the Belgian pension plans, we refer to above.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,284,M&A,284.60,2.24 Share-based payments,284.60.1,,"Share-based compensation benefits are provided to key managers via the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The LTIP is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment plan. Equity settled share-based payments The fair value of the goods or services received is recognized with a corresponding increase in equity. The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model. A share-based payment award generally vests upon meeting specified conditions. Vesting conditions are either: - Service conditions, which require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service during which the services are provided to the entity; or - Performance conditions, which requires the counterparty to complete a specified period of service (i.e., a service condition) and involves specified performance targets to be met while the counterparty is rendering the required service. A performance condition is further defined as either a market condition or a non-market condition. A market condition is a performance condition (i.e., requires specified targets to be met) and the performance conditions are related to the market price (or value) of the entity’s equity instruments, such as: attaining a specified share price or achieving a specified target that is based on the market price (or value) of the entity’s equity instruments relative to an index of market prices of equity instruments of other entities. A condition linked to a purely internal financial performance measure, such as profit or earnings per share, is not a market condition. Such measures will affect the share price, but are not directly linked to it, and hence are not market conditions. For a market condition to be treated as a performance vesting condition rather than a non-vesting condition, there must also be an implicit or explicit service condition. Under IFRS 2, the nature of the condition (i.e., vesting or non-vesting, service, performance, market or non-market) affects the timing of when the expense is recognized and, in some cases, the measurement of the expense. In addition, if a condition is not met, whether the entity may reverse the previously recognized compensation expense depends on the nature of the condition that was not met. Therefore, the classification of a condition is a critical step in accounting for share-based payment transactions. Market conditions are only considered when estimating the fair value of the award at the grant date. Non-market vesting conditions are not considered when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the grant date. Instead, these vesting conditions are considered by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount to reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest. Such non-market vesting conditions include a service condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,284,M&A,284.61,2.25 Revenue recognition,284.61.1,,"The Group mainly generates revenue from offering temporary staffing solutions to its customers. The duration of these temporary staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two years. The Group mainly offers temporary staffing solutions in the following industries: construction industry, manufacturing industry, logistics industry, sales and finance industry. The Group also provides solutions to customers active in larger project-oriented businesses (such as the construction industry) where apart from staffing also specific deliverables must be provided for. Projects may take one week up to two to three months. The Group has identified one performance obligation within the vast majority of its customer contracts, i.e. the delivery of services for a predefined period of time by one or more temping staff or consultants. Revenue from temporary staffing solutions is traditionally negotiated and invoiced to customers using an hourly rate (i.e. the transaction price). Temporary workers charge all their worked hours on project codes which are then accumulated on a weekly or monthly basis and billed to customers. Revenue from temporary staffing solutions is recognized over time upon rendering the services. Revenues related to services rendered in the project business are recognized upon the performance of the service under contract by comparing the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. This is determined based on the actual costs incurred as compared to the total expected costs to incur to successfully complete the project. Revenue from permanent placements includes the fee received or receivable for the services provided. This fee is generally a percentage of the remuneration package of the candidate placed (net basis). The revenue of these placements is recognized at a point in time on completion of the service when the performance obligations are fulfilled, (for example the start date of the candidate placed). ----- The Group recognizes project related receivables if the Group has a right to payment for goods and services already transferred to a customer if that right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. These project related receivables are recognized as part of the other receivables. Contract fulfilment costs related to this project business are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods and services to which these assets relate. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known to management. Customers are invoiced on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis and the consideration is payable when invoiced. The Group offers volume rebates to a limited number of customers. The Group applies the ‘most likely amount method’ for contracts with a single volume threshold and the ‘expected value method’ for contracts with more than one volume threshold. The Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. For sales arrangements where the Group acts as a principal in the transaction and has the principal risk and rewards of ownership, including amongst others, the obligation to deliver the services, revenue is reported gross by the Group. Under arrangements where the Group acts as an agent, revenue is reported on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

When a loan and receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans and receivables is recognized using the original effective interest rate. ----- #### 3 GROUP STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE OF HR Since the creation of the Belgian Accent Group in 1995, the Group has significantly expanded its business as a result of a number of important and material external acquisitions. All these acquisitions are in-line with the mid- to long-term strategy of the House of HR to gain a more international foothold and to become a Group mainly offering services around specialized recruitment and engineering and consulting. The Group is now active in more than 10 European countries. As part of the legal reorganization of the Group completed in 2018, the majority of the minority shareholders, which represented former management of the acquired companies, exchanged their non-controlling interests, together with any related shareholder loans (financial liabilities recognized in various entities of the Group) for cash and new shares issued by the parent company of the Group. Consequently, the Group currently holds into the majority of its subsidiaries 100% of the issued shares. As a result of the changes in the equity held by non-controlling interests, the Group has adjusted the carrying amounts of the controlling and any remaining non-controlling interests to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid are directly recognized into equity. During 2021, the Group further expanded with the acquisition of Solyne, Greenworking, Avanti, Cohedron, Vanberkel and Bureau Brug. The Group’s structure as per 31 December 2021 is as follows: HR I = former Naxicap ----- While the Group obtains control over the acquired entities, the Group does not always acquire all of the issued shares of these entities. The remaining shares are held by the former management of the acquired entities. To facilitate the acquisitions, new holdings are created in which the Group and the minority shareholders both contribute into the share capital in relation to the shares in the holding held by them. These holdings are consolidated in full by the Group. Amounts allocated to the minority shareholders are recognized as a separate component of the equity of the Group.

Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of these currencies of +/-10% is considered as immaterial. Interest rate risk The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. At 31 December 2021, the Group has EUR 550,00 million of outstanding bank loans, structured as a bullet loan under the Senior Facility Agreement. Once per year, excess cash flow is calculated based on final audited accounts which serve to determine whether a mandatory prepayment of the Senior Facility Agreement should take place under this agreement. So far, no mandatory prepayments have taken place. These loans are floating rate borrowings, with interest based on Euribor floored to zero plus a fixed margin of 4,25 if leverage is greater than or equal to 3.25x. As per February 19, 2021 the Group has successfully repriced their Senior Facility Agreement, resulting in a 50 BPS reduction. As a result the interest is based on Euribor floored to zero plus a fixed margin of 3,75 depending on the leverage. The total impact of the repricing amounts to EUR 13,07 million saving for the Group. Total financing expenses for this repricing of EUR 2,75 million are capitalized as part of the bank borrowings and are being depreciated over the remaining lifetime of the loan. At 31 December 2021, the Group has EUR 370,00 million of outstanding Senior Secured Notes, due in 2026, with a fixed interest rate of 4,375% and EUR 200,00 million of outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes, due in 2027, with a fixed interest rate of 7,50%. No hedging instruments are in place during 2021 to cover any potential interest rate risk. Notes are issued with a fixed interest rate of 4,375% and 7,50%. For Term Loan B (EUR 550,00 million) a variable interest rate is applicable. The floating rate borrowings are entirely accounted for at amortized cost, and therefore the impact of changes in the market interest rate on the fair value of these floating rate borrowings at the closing date will have no impact on the income statement or on the equity. The Group does not apply hedge accounting. Euribor floating rate borrowings which are not covered by the swaps are subject to interest rate risk. An increase (decrease) of 100 basis points in interest rate as per year-end would have an effect on profit after tax and equity as follows: 31 December 2021 Increase 100 bps **-5.500.000 Decrease 100 bps **5.500.000 The Group has in total EUR 5,72 million of borrowings from related parties outstanding at the period ended 31 December 2021. ----- Credit risk Credit risk for the Group mainly arises from cash and cash equivalents, favorable derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables. Risk management The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk other than that for ordinary debtors. The Group has policies to ensure that the services are provided to customers with an appropriate credit history. Credit risk is managed locally by each subgroup (brand). Credit risk mainly arises as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables. The credit quality of customers, considering the financial position of customers, past experience and other factors, is closely assessed by the credit department on a regular basis. During 2020 a credit insurance program was set-up through the entire group, in order for House of HR to have control over their open receivables, especially in challenging Covid19 times. Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the finance committee. The utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. Management does not expect any material losses from non-performance by these counterparties. Impairment of financial assets The Group has three types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model: - trade receivables for sales of services; - receivables resulting from project services in progress; - debt investments carried at amortized cost. While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was no identified impairment loss. Trade receivables The Group applies the IFRS9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before each reporting year-end and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macro-economic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. Forward-looking information has been considered in assessing the Expected Credit Loss impairment under IFRS9, taken into consideration the possible downside resulting from the Covid19 pandemic. This did not result in a significant impact on the ECL model assumptions. ----- On that basis, the expected credit loss allowance as at 31 December 2021 was determined as follows for both trade receivables: More than 60 days past due More than 1 year past due Total At 31 December 2021 Current More than 30 days past due Expected loss rate 0,11% 1,49% 13,30% 2,36% **0,55% Gross carrying amount – Trade receivables 219.216.571 7.826.230 6.574.177 3.306.017 **236.922.994 Gross carrying amount – Contract assets 1.278.118 **1.278.118 Foreign exchange risk Overview of exchange rates 31 December 2020 31 December 2019 Average At year-end Average At year-end CHF 1,08 1,09 1,11 1,09 PLN 4,44 4,57 4,30 4,26 RON 4,84 4,87 4,75 4,78 HUF 351,25 363,89 The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is very limited as the Group’s operations are essentially denominated in euro.

An increase (decrease) of 100 basis points in interest rate as per year-end would have an effect on profit after tax and equity as follows: 31 December 2020 Increase 100 bps **-5.500.000 Decrease 100 bps **5.500.000 considering floor at 0% The Group has in total EUR 3,72 million of borrowings from related parties outstanding at the period ended 31 December 2020. Credit risk Credit risk for the Group mainly arises from cash and cash equivalents, favorable derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables. ----- Risk management The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk other than that for ordinary debtors. The Group has policies to ensure that the services are provided to customers with an appropriate credit history. Credit risk is managed locally by each subgroup (brand). Certain subsidiaries have credit insurance in place. Negotiations are ongoing to further implement this for the entire group. Credit risk mainly arises as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables. The credit quality of customers, considering the financial position of customers, past experience and other factors, is closely assessed by the credit department on a regular basis. During 2020 a credit insurance program was set-up through the entire group, in order for House of HR to have control over their open receivables, especially in challenging Covid19 times. Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the finance committee. The utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties. Impairment of financial assets The Group has three types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model: - trade receivables for sales of services; - receivables resulting from project services in progress; - debt investments carried at amortized cost. While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was no identified impairment loss. Trade receivables The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before each reporting year-end and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macro-economic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. Forward-looking information has been considered in assessing the Expected Credit Loss impairment under IFRS9, taken into consideration the possible downside resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. This did not result is a significant impact on the ECL model assumptions. On that basis, the expected credit loss allowance as at 31 December 2020 was determined as follows for both trade receivables: More than 60 days past due More than 1 year past due Total At 31 December 2020 Current More than 30 days past due Expected loss rate 0,12% 1,28% 12,12% 5,33% **0,77% Gross carrying amount – Trade receivables 164.558.946 9.617.970 7.078.890 4.622.787 **185.878.594",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 120 days past due. Several factors are considered in assessing the likelihood of impairment which is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Impairment losses on trade receivables and project related receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item. The Group first applies this policy under the incurred loss model, and then, for the rest of receivables which are not provided for, the Group applies the expected credit loss model, and recognizes an additional provision. ----- The aging overview as of each year-end date is as follows: Aging of trade receivables, based on invoice date 31 December 2021 31 December 2020 Amount % Amount % Less than 1 month **185.766.076** **78%** 153.433.513 83% Between 1 and 2 months **30.736.635** **13%** 17.183.575 9% Between 2 months and 1 year **16.770.850** **7%** 10.615.654 6% Between 1 and 2 years **1.161.270** **0%** 1.355.928 1% More than 2 year **2.488.163** **1%** 3.289.924 2% of which Not impaired **230.579.860** **97%** 178.378.401 96% Impaired **6.343.134** **3%** 7.500.039 4% Total** **236.922.994** **100%** 185.878.440 100% As of 31 December 2021, trade receivables of EUR 36,80 million were past due but not impaired.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities affected in future periods. This note provides an overview of the areas that involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be wrong. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

As this option is not considered to be closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized separately from the host contract and has been measured at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently at fair value through income statement. The Optional Redemption of Notes is valued using financial models available in Bloomberg. The value of the option feature is equal to the difference between the bond price observed on the market and the estimated bond price if there was no redemption option. It is then adjusted to capture the impact of the costs of refinancing.

This segment reporting also reflects better the strategy of House of HR towards becoming even more specialized in the Human Resources solutions market. The final purpose of this segmentation is to better focus on how to attract candidates and present the services to our client base. This initiative is supported with the acquisition of Solyne, Greenworking, Avanti, Cohedron, Vanberkel and Bureau Brug in 2021 (refer to note 3.1). With this new approach of two segments, the Group is able to deliver custom made solutions to our target markets, and believes it will deliver faster than market sales growth. - Specialized Talent Solutions: The Specialized Talent Solutions segment provides on the one hand temporary staffing solutions with a focus on ‘temp-to-perm’ placements, international job candidate recruiting and permanent placements for clients who need specific job profiles, and on the other hand (mostly) short-term staffing solutions to larger clients with multiple staffing needs. - Engineering & consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving sectors like energy, pharmaceuticals, technology etc. The Group also assists clients with the search and selection of the right candidate, interim management or secondment. Corporate management is responsible for managing performance, underlying risks, and effectiveness of operations. The table below shows the segment information provided to the strategic steering committee for the reportable segments and the basis on which revenue is recognized. The income statement of 2020 has been restated excluding the disposal of GRITT Projects NV (engineering & consulting segment). The post-tax gain/loss from discontinued operations is presented on a separate line in the income statement.

The majority of the internally developed software as well as the software under development relates to the “MyAccent app” and the “My tools” digital platform that is used by Accent Jobs for People to run the HR business; the IT platform named “FLOW” developed by Cohedron to bring together budget counselling, guardianship and debt counselling; and the development of the apps created by the Group such as Nowjobs, SWOP, Softskills, etc. The Group expenses a total of EUR 3,2 million of research and development expenditures in the income statement. Amortizations on intangible assets are charged to the Selling Expenses (EUR 30,54 million) and the General and administrative expenses (EUR 6,79 million) in the statement of financial performance. There are no intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. #### 8 GOODWILL Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated by Group management to the following two segments: - The Specialized Talent Solutions segment, which provides on the one hand temporary staffing solutions with a focus on ‘tempto-perm’ placements, international job candidate recruiting and permanent placements for clients who need specific job profiles, and on the other hand (mostly) short-term staffing solutions to larger clients with multiple staffing needs. The Specialized Talent Solutions Segment is composed of the Accent Group, the Covebo Group, and the TimePartner Group, excluding AERO and IBB which are part of the Engineering and Consulting segment. - Engineering & Consulting: The Group recruits highly skilled professionals to work in fast evolving sectors like energy, pharmaceuticals, technology, search and selection, interim management or secondment – in line with client needs. The Engineering & Consulting segment is composed of the GRITT, Vialegis, Abylsen, Continu, Redmore, Cohedron and part of the TimePartner Group, being AERO and IBB. The Group capitalizes amounts of both externally acquired software and internally developed software. Internally developed software is initially classified under the category “Software under development” and is transferred to the category “Internally generated software” once the software becomes available for use. As from that moment amortizations will start. ----- Externally acquired software The carrying amount of externally acquired software amounts to EUR 1,06 million as per 31 December 2020. The main amounts recorded for externally acquired software relates to licenses for ERP packages used within the Group (mainly Tagetik and Navision). Internally developed software and software under development The carrying amount of internally generated software amounts to EUR 16,55 million as per 31 December 2020. The carrying amount of software under development amounts to EUR 1,95 million as per 31 December 2020. The majority of the internally developed software as well as the software under development relates to new features in the “MyAccent app” and the “My tools” digital platform that is used by Accent Jobs for People to run the HR business, and the development of the apps created by the Group such as SWOP, Softskills, etc. The Group did not expense a material amount of research and development expenditure in the income statement.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

This impairment test is annually performed based on Q3 interim financial statements. For the 31 December 2021 reporting period, the recoverable amount of the CGU’s was determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year window for the 2021 impairment. Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated ----- below. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to the industry in which each CGU operates. The calculation of value in use for all CGU’s are most sensitive to the following assumptions: - Post-tax discount rates: Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on the interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.. 31 December 2020 Post-tax discount rate 31 December 2021 Specialized Talent Solutions **9,45%** 10,6% Engineering & Consulting **9,29%** 10,6% - EBITDA Margin: The EBITDA margins are based upon past performance and management’s expectations for the future. 31 December 2020 EBITDA Margin 31 December 2021 Specialized Talent Solutions **9,6%** 9,0% Engineering & Consulting **18,7%** 15,0% - Growth rate estimates: Rates are based on published inflation rates provided by the IMF (International Monetary Fund).

The CGU’s Specialized Staffing and Consulting and Engineering are strong markets for which nor a 0% sales growth nor a decrease in EBITDA of 200 bps, nor an increase in WACC up to 200 bps impacts the carrying amount of the goodwill and (in)tangible assets. The CGU General Staffing is under pressure as a result of the AUG-reform in 2018, impacting the performance of the business in Germany. Sensitivity analysis has shown sufficient headroom in calculating the carrying value of this CGU, as a 0% sales growth in the perpetuity or an increase in WACC of 200 bps does not result in an impairment risk. EBITDA margin for General Staffing however should be maintained as an EBITDA drop above 100 bps might result in an impairment risk. ----- #### 9 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Furniture and vehicles Plant, machinery and equipment Other tangible fixed assets Leased PP&E Total PPE Property, Plant and Equipment Land and Buildings The value of the derivative is mainly impacted by the yield of the underlying debt.

A derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to an embedded derivative – the right for the issuer to exercise an early payment option. As this option is not considered to be closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized and has been measured at the fair value on initial recognition with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. The fair value of this early repayment option as per 31 December 2020 amounts to EUR 1,42 million for the Senior Secured Notes and EUR 0,33 million for the Senior Unsecured Notes. At year-end 2021 a derivative financial asset of EUR 3,03 million has been recognized. The prepayment option relating to the Senior (Un)Secured Notes is valued using financial models available in Bloomberg. The value of the option feature is equal to the difference between the bond price observed on the market and the estimated bond price if there was no redemption option. It is then adjusted to capture the impact of the costs of refinancing. The main parameters of the analysis are the bond price, the volatility of interest rates and the net book value of the refinancing fees. Relating to the Senior Unsecured Notes, three redemption options and one repurchase option is included in the Note. These options are the following, i.e. - Repurchase option triggered by a Change of Control - Optional Redemption on Certain Tender Offers - Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons - Optional Redemption of Notes The contract does not require the issuer to make mandatory redemption payments with respect to the Note. Expert judgement is used to argue that the fair value of the following embedded options are nihil: Repurchase option triggered by a Change of Control, Optional Redemption on Certain Tender Offers and Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons. The Group does not use derivatives for speculative investments. The Group has Senior (Un)Secured Notes of EUR 570,00 million as disclosed in borrowings (please refer to note 16 for more details). A derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to an embedded derivative – the right for the issuer to exercise an early payment option. As this option is not considered to be closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized and has been measured at the fair value on initial recognition with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. At year-end 2019, a derivative financial asset of EUR 7,57 million has been recognized relating to the early repayment option included in the Senior Secured Notes. The fair value of this early repayment option as per 31 December 2020 amounts to EUR 1,42 million. At year-end 2020, a derivative financial asset of EUR 0,33 million has been recognized relating to the early repayment option included in the Senior Unsecured Notes. Differences in fair value in 2020 vs. 2019 are recorded via P&L, as finance income/expense (refer to note 30). The prepayment option relating to the Senior Secured Notes is valued by taking the difference between two loan values. The first loan value is calculated by discounting all cash flows of the loan with the interest rate at the time of the cash flow being paid plus a constant spread; this value represents the value of the loan without a prepayment option. Regarding the second loan value, the cash flows are also discounted by the interest rate at the time of the cash flow being paid plus a constant spread, however, the amount of cash flows will decrease if the interest rate drops, e.g. the loan is prepaid. Since the option will only be exercised if this is beneficial to the holder, the value of the option is floored at zero. This process is repeated for 10 thousand (risk-neutral) interest simulations of which the average is taken in order to determine the price of the option at this time. The valuation is done under the assumption that the loan is prepaid on the first payment date after the 7-year forward rate at a point in time of the simulation passes below the initial 7-year forward rate, the prepayment option should be priced in a risk-neutral setting and a regular smooth spline through the curves is fitted in order to interpolate different points on the curve. Relating to the Senior Unsecured Notes, three redemption options and one repurchase option is included in the Note. These options are the following, i.e. - Repurchase option triggered by a Change of Control - Optional Redemption on Certain Tender Offers - Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons - Optional Redemption of Notes The contract does not require the issuer to make mandatory redemption payments with respect to the Note. Expert judgement is used to argue that the fair value of the following embedded options are nihil: Repurchase option triggered by a Change of Control, Optional Redemption on Certain Tender Offers and Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons. The Optional Redemption of Notes is valued by taking the difference between two loan values. The first loan value is calculated by discounting all cash flows of the loan with the interest rate at the time of the cash flow being paid plus a constant spread; this value represents the value of the loan without a prepayment option.

This process is repeated for 10 thousand (risk-neutral) interest simulations of which the average is taken in order to determine the price of the option at this time. The following assumptions have been used to model the embedded prepayment option. The Group expects the impact of these choices to be neglectable: - A 30/360 day count convention is used to determine the time till each coupon payment. - A regular smooth spline if fit through the curves, in order to interpolate different points on the curve. - The assumption is made that the Redemption option is executed on the first payment date when the fair value of the Redemption Option is positive from the perspective of the issuer.

As both the late payment risk and credit risk have been substantially transferred to the counterparty, this agreement has been accounted for as a non-recourse agreement as the continuing involvement is considered insignificant. At year-end 2021, EUR 106,42 million accounts receivable has been transferred to the factor which has been deducted from the open trade receivables as per December 31, 2021. A further EUR 23,24 million is recorded as other receivable and comprises the difference between the gross trade receivable sold and the amount received from the factoring company (90% for Accent and GRITT, 85% for TimePartner, 80% for Continu, 70% for Covebo and 90% for Avanti).",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

The Group launched a share-based payment plan throughout 2018 offering management team to participate in a LTIP. The purpose of the plan is to create an incentive for members of management and executives of the Group who can make an important contribution to the success and the growth of the Group, to help the Group retaining and attracting managers with the necessary experience and skills, and to align the interests of those managers with the grantors’ interests as shareholders of the Company and give them the opportunity to share in the value creation and growth of the Group. The term of the options runs from the grant date until 28 June 2023 for Belgian tax residents (5 years maximum vesting period). For other beneficiaries, the term of validity is maximum 10 years. The plan is settled in the ordinary shares of the Company. The option holder may exercise the options subject to the occurrence of an exit event, a non-exit event or a good leaver event. The plan contains several vesting conditions: a. Service conditions – the beneficiary should have a contractual relationship with the group at the vesting date (in case of an exit or a non-exit event) or qualify as a good leaver (in case of a good leaver event); b. Performance conditions – the number of options that vest (and can be exercised) is determined at the vesting date and depends on the return (or a deemed return) of the grantors on the initial value (effectively the increase in the fair value of the shares of the Group since 31/12/2017). This LTIP is comprised of 100 million share options, of which 75 million are granted during 2018, 12,5 million during 2019 and 12,5 million during 2021. The share options are granted free of charge at the grant date. The fair value per share option at grant date in 2018 amounts to EUR 2,17 compared to the exercise price of EUR 1,53 after the capital reduction of 2020. For the shares granted in 2019 and 2021, the fair value per share amounts to EUR 1,33 and EUR 1,63 respectively. The value of the shares has been determined based on an EBITDA-multiple model (correcting for net debt) and is recognized in P&L based on the exit probability.

The average contractual lifetime per end of December 2021 for the options amounts to 5,05 years. The corresponding weighted average exercise price amounts to 2,00 EUR.

These mainly relate to invoices for services such as rent, electricity, IT, etc. The increase in trade payables compared to 31 December 2020 mainly results from the 2021 acquisitions (EUR 20,58 million trade payables as per 31 December 2021).

The share options are granted free of charge at the grant date. The fair value per share option at grant date in 2018 amounts to €2,17 compared to the current exercise price of €1,53 after the capital reduction of 2020 (note 15). For the shares granted in 2019, the fair value per share amounts to €1,33. The value of the shares has been determined based on an EBITDA-multiple model (correcting for net debt) and is recognized in P&L based on the exit probability. As the expected volatility of the people included in the plan has no impact on the total value, no assumption was made in this respect. As a result of the accounting for the LTIP during the period, an expense has been recognized in the income statement with a corresponding credit in equity in 2018 for EUR 13,95 million and EUR 4,65 million in 2019 and EUR 3,93 million in 2020.

In the main markets of House of HR (Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France), business restrictions and lockdowns led to significant temporary reductions in clients’ activities and, hence, their demand for temporary employment and consulting projects. After the first wave from March to April 2020, the situation began to get better, with activities recovering fast until the second lockdown at the end of the summer. Growth slowed at this point, but did not stop. House of HR maintained a positive EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) in every individual month of 2020. Looking ahead, management believes House of HR is in a strong position to benefit from the expected recovery in 2021. Although great progress has been made in the release of vaccines, the rates of vaccination continue to be moderate in terms of % of the population protected, and therefore, the Covid19 pandemic is still considered as an uncertain factor in our day-to-day business. At this point in time the duration of the pandemic and the impact on the financial results of the Group are difficult to predict. Nevertheless, the vaccination programs will have a positive impact on the overall society and the world economy along 2021 and therefore on House of HR its business potential. The Board confirms that, based on the information currently available the needs of the Group in the near term are covered and the Group will be able to fulfill its financial obligations for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. #### 37 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Under the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS’s”), the Company is required to test the amount of goodwill impairment at least annually. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We consider this matter as a key audit matter because of the significance of the account and because of the complexity of the assessment process, the significant judgments in respect of assumptions about the future results of the business and the discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts. The most important management assumptions relate to the discount rate, growth rates of revenue and EBITDA margin. How our audit addressed the key audit matter We challenged if the impairment test was performed at the level of the CGU (the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of each other). We challenged the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests and the process through which they were prepared. We found that the projected cash flow for 2022 was consistent with the Board approved budgets, which were subject to timely oversight and challenge by the Directors. We have critically assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and evaluation of business plans by comparing the prior year’s forecast with the Group’s actual performance. For the cash flows after 2021, we critically assessed and challenged the assumptions related to the long-term growth rates, by comparing them to industry forecasts and historical growth rates. We compared the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) to the cost of capital and debt of the Group and comparable organisations, as well as considering territory specific factors. We tested the calculation method used and the accuracy thereof. We compared EBITDA margin with past actuals. We challenged the adequacy of management’s sensitivity analysis of the headroom. For all CGUs we calculated the degree to which these assumptions would need to move before an impairment conclusion was triggered and found the likelihood of such a movement to be unlikely. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow model and certain significant assumptions. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures (Note 8) in the financial statements. ----- We found management’s judgments in respect of the impairment test to be within an acceptable range of reasonable estimates.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated accounts. In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to the audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium. A statutory audit does not provide any assurance as to the Group’s future viability nor as to the efficiency or effectiveness of the board of directors’ current or future business management at Group level. Our responsibilities in respect of the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the board of directors’ are described below. ----- As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors; - Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern; - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; - Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the board of directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the board of directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated accounts of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

The Group acquired 100% of the share capital in Cohedron for EUR 115,43 million during the financial year. As set out in note 3.1, this is a significant acquisition since it represents an entire new ‘powerhouse’. Under the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS’s”) and more specifically in line with the requirements of IFRS 3 – Business Combinations the Directors performed a purchase price allocation (PPA). The PPA is subject to significant Directors’ judgement and estimation in the following areas: - Identification and valuation of potential provisions for risks; - Identification and valuation of intangible assets (including goodwill); and - Determination of the amortisation period for the identified intangible assets. Based on thorough due diligence analysis and detailed calculations, the Directors performed the PPA and also determined the resulting goodwill. We consider this matter to be a key audit matter because of the complexity of the assessment process, the significant judgments and the estimates involved in respect of determining the PPA as well as the value allocated to intangible assets and goodwill. How our audit addressed the key audit matter We started by engaging our internal valuation experts to perform an independent assessment of the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the respective acquisition dates specifically relating to the valuation and identification of intangible assets and the resultant goodwill which was recognised. This independent assessment was evaluated against the Directors’ assessment by performing the following procedures: - We verified that the valuation methods used are consistent with the ones generally accepted within the industry; - We verified that identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were appropriately valued, in all material respects; - We scrutinized the SPAs and Due Diligence Reports relating to the acquisitions to identify potential additional items to be valued as part of the PPA; - We assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions used in determining the useful lives of the definite life intangible assets acquired, against those determined by the Directors; ----- - We assessed disclosure 3.1 in the financial statements against the relevant IFRS disclosure requirements.

Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units).

They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement. An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not more than any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognized at the date of derecognition. Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortized while they are classified as held for sale. Interests and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognized.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The equity component is recognized initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,284,M&A,284.304,2.20 Borrowings,284.304.1,,"Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortized cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates. The fair value of the liability portion of a convertible bond is determined using a market interest rate for an equivalent nonconvertible bond. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortized cost basis until extinguishment on conversion or maturity of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option. This is recognized and included in shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects. Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss as other income or finance costs. Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the entity issues equity instruments to a creditor to extinguish all or part of the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued.

Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. ----- Provisions are measured at the present value of Group management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. Where there are several similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by the Group by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense. In case the Group expects a reimbursement from another party, the Group will recognize a separate asset when and only when it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received. The amount recognized for the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of the provision.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,284,M&A,284.315,2.25 Share-based payments,284.315.1,,"Share-based compensation benefits are provided to key managers via the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The LTIP is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment plan. Equity settled share-based payments The fair value of the goods or services received is recognized with a corresponding increase in equity. The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model. A share-based payment award generally vests upon meeting specified conditions. Vesting conditions are either: - Service conditions, which require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service during which the services are provided to the entity; or - Performance conditions, which requires the counterparty to complete a specified period of service (i.e., a service condition) and involves specified performance targets to be met while the counterparty is rendering the required service. A performance condition is further defined as either a market condition or a non-market condition. A market condition is a performance condition (i.e., requires specified targets to be met) and the performance conditions are related to the market price (or value) of the entity’s equity instruments, such as: attaining a specified share price or achieving a specified target that is based on the market price (or value) of the entity’s equity instruments relative to an index of market prices of equity instruments of other entities. A condition linked to a purely internal financial performance measure, such as profit or earnings per share, is not a market condition. Such measures will affect the share price, but are not directly linked to it, and hence are not market conditions. For a market condition to be treated as a performance vesting condition rather than a non-vesting condition, there must also be an implicit or explicit service condition. Under IFRS 2, the nature of the condition (i.e., vesting or non-vesting, service, performance, market or non-market) affects the timing of when the expense is recognized and, in some cases, the measurement of the expense. In addition, if a condition is not met, whether the entity may reverse the previously recognized compensation expense depends on the nature of the condition that was not met. Therefore, the classification of a condition is a critical step in accounting for share-based payment transactions. Market conditions are only considered when estimating the fair value of the award at the grant date. Non-market vesting conditions are not considered when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the grant date. Instead, these vesting conditions are considered by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount to reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest. Such non-market vesting conditions include a service condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,284,M&A,284.316,2.26 Revenue recognition,284.316.1,,"The Group mainly generates revenue from offering temporary staffing solutions to its customers. The duration of these temporary staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two years. The Group mainly offers temporary staffing solutions in the following industries: construction industry, manufacturing industry, logistics industry, sales and finance industry. The Group also provides solutions to customers active in larger project-oriented businesses (such as the construction industry) where apart from staffing also specific deliverables must be provided for. Projects may take one week up to two to three months. The Group has identified one performance obligation within the vast majority of its customer contracts, i.e. the delivery of services for a predefined period of time by one or more temping staff or consultants. Revenue from temporary staffing solutions is traditionally negotiated and invoiced to customers using an hourly rate (i.e. the transaction price). Temporary workers charge all their worked hours on project codes which are then accumulated on a weekly or monthly basis and billed to customers. Revenue from temporary staffing solutions is recognized over time upon rendering the services. Revenues related to services rendered in the project business are recognized upon the performance of the service under contract by comparing the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. This is determined based on the actual costs incurred as compared to the total expected costs to incur to successfully complete the project. The Group recognizes project related receivables if the Group has a right to payment for goods and services already transferred to a customer if that right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. These project related receivables are recognized as part of the other receivables. ----- Contract fulfilment costs related to this project business are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods and services to which these assets relate. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known to management. Customers are invoiced on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis and the consideration is payable when invoiced. The Group offers volume rebates to a limited number of customers. The Group applies the ‘most likely amount method’ for contracts with a single volume threshold and the ‘expected value method’ for contracts with more than one volume threshold. The Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. For sales arrangements where the Group acts as a principal in the transaction and has the principal risk and rewards of ownership, including amongst others, the obligation to deliver the services and the credit risk, revenue is reported gross by the Group. Under arrangements where the Group acts as an agent, revenue is reported on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

When a loan and receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans and receivables is recognized using the original effective interest rate. ----- #### 3 GROUP STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE OF HR Since the creation of the Belgian Accent Group in 1995, the Group has significantly expanded its business as a result of a number of important and material external acquisitions. All these acquisitions are in-line with the mid- to long-term strategy of the House of HR to gain a more international foothold and to become a Group mainly offering services around specialized recruitment and engineering and consulting. The Group is now active in more than 10 European countries. As part of the legal reorganization of the Group completed in 2018, the majority of the minority shareholders, which represented former management of the acquired companies, exchanged their non-controlling interests, together with any related shareholder loans (financial liabilities recognized in various entities of the Group) for cash and new shares issued by the parent company of the Group. Consequently, the Group currently holds into the majority of its subsidiaries 100% of the issued shares. All non-controlling interests held by former management in the Redmore and Vialegis Group were acquired by the Group as per 14 January 2019. As a result of the changes in the equity held by non-controlling interests, the Group has adjusted the carrying amounts of the controlling and any remaining non-controlling interests to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid are directly recognized into equity. During 2020, the Group further expanded with the acquisition of TechMatch and Book’U. On the other hand, the Group sold its share in GRITT Projects NV. The Group’s structure as per 31 December 2020 is as follows: HR I = former Naxicap ----- While the Group obtains control over the acquired entities, the Group does not always acquire all of the issued shares of these entities. The remaining shares are held by the former management of the acquired entities. To facilitate the acquisitions, new holdings are created in which the Group and the minority shareholders both contribute into the share capital in relation to the shares in the holding held by them. These holdings are consolidated in full by the Group. Amounts allocated to the minority shareholders are recognized as a separate component of the equity of the Group. The following notes provide more information on the changes in the Group structure in 2020:",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 120 days past due. Several factors are considered in assessing the likelihood of impairment which is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Impairment losses on trade receivables and project related receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item. The Group first applies this policy under the incurred loss model, and then, for the rest of receivables which are not provided for, the Group applies the expected credit loss model, and recognizes an additional provision.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities affected in future periods. This note provides an overview of the areas that involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be wrong. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to the industry in which each CGU operates. The calculation of value in use for all CGU’s are most sensitive to the following assumptions: - Post-tax discount rates: Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on the interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data. 31 December 2019 Post-tax discount rate 31 December 2020 General Staffing **10,6%** 9,2% Specialized Staffing **10,6%** 9,3% Engineering & Consulting **10,6%** 9,1% - EBITDA Margin: The EBITDA margins are based upon past performance and management’s expectations for the future. 31 December 2019 EBITDA Margin 31 December 2020 General Staffing **7,0%** 7,4% Specialized Staffing **9,0%** 10,4% Engineering & Consulting **15,0%** 18,8% - Growth rate estimates: Rates are based on published inflation rates provided by the IMF (International Monetary Fund).

The duration of these temporary staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two years (without minimum volumes attached to these contracts). The Group also provides solutions to customers active in project-oriented businesses where apart from staffing also specific deliverables have to be provided for. Projects may take one week up to two to three months. The Group does not have a single major customer from which it generates revenue. Although the Covid-19 pandemic started during the first quarter of 2020, the effect of the pandemic is mainly visible as from the second quarter of the year, as governments have taken very strict measures to prevent the epidemy to spread further as from mid-March 2020. These measures include social distancing, country wide quarantines, closing of non-essential business, and many alike. Consequently, since mid-March 2020 the world economy has come to a stop and also the company’s key markets, resulting in a slow-down of the Group’s activity. Governments have approved very strong support measures for businesses and individuals, mainly focused in helping to adapt the workforce to the new reality and providing liquidity to companies (by providing direct financing, guarantees to be used in front of financial institutions and delaying the payment of certain taxes). During the third quarter of 2020, economy was slowly picking up. Unfortunately this has slowed down again in the last quarter of 2020 as Covid-19 measures were increasing again. The economic consequences of the decisions required to stop the spread of the virus heavily impact 2020 performance of the Group.

In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated accounts. In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to the audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium. A statutory audit does not provide any assurance as to the Group’s future viability nor as to the efficiency or effectiveness of the board of directors’ current or future business management at Group level. Our responsibilities in respect of the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the board of directors are described below. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. ----- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,284,M&A,284.513,Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets – Note 7 and 8,284.513.3,,"Description of the key audit matter House of HR carries a significant value of goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet amounting to EUR 1.037 million as detailed in disclosure 7 and 8. Under the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS’s”), the Company is required to test the amount of goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We consider this matter as a key audit matter because of the significance of the account and because of the complexity of the assessment process, the significant judgments in respect of assumptions about the future results of the business and the discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts. The most important management assumptions relate to the discount rate, growth rates of revenue and EBITDA margin. How our audit addressed the key audit matter We challenged if the impairment test was performed at the level of the CGU (the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of each other). We challenged the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests and the process through which they were prepared. We found that the projected cash flow for 2021 was consistent with the Board approved budgets, which were subject to timely oversight and challenge by the Directors. We have critically assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and evaluation of business plans by comparing the prior year’s forecast with the Group’s actual performance. For the cash flows after 2021, we critically assessed and checked the assumptions related to the long-term growth rates, by comparing them to industry forecasts and historical growth rates. We compared the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) to the cost of capital and debt of the Group and comparable organisations, as well as considering territory specific factors. We tested the calculation method used and the accuracy thereof. We compared EBITDA margin, working capitaland CAPEX percentage with past actuals. We challenged the adequacy of management’s sensitivity analysis of the headroom. For all CGUs we calculated the degree to which these assumptions would need to move before an impairment conclusion was triggered and found the likelihood of such a movement to be unlikely. ----- Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow model and certain significant assumptions. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures (Note 7 and 8) in the financial statements. We found management’s judgments in respect of the impairment test to be within an acceptable range of reasonable estimates.",N/A,as_expected,2022,754

Agium offers staffing and ad interim services of skilled financial professionals (both on payroll and externally hired). The Company also provides additional services such as recruitment (Talent & Business, hereafter: T&B), coaching and training to clients located in The Netherlands. House of HR has completed the deal with Bain Capital Private Equity on 3 November 2022, making the latter the majority shareholder of the group with a 55% equity stake. The remaining equity is split between the founder Conny Vandendriessche, the exiting majority shareholder Naxicap and more than 500 employee shareholders. Thanks to this new strategic partnership, House of HR will be able to scale up its unique platform into new markets and increase digital investments. In the light of this deal the existing share based payment plan has been settled with the beneficiaries. The exercise price of the options in 2022 was 2,88 EUR per share. Together with the closing of the transaction, the existing indebtedness has been repaid and replaced by a total indebtedness of the group of EUR 1.859,08 million, in various tranches at various rates. Additionally, a EUR 250 million Revolving Credit Facility is available for the group. To optimize the legal structure a new holding entity has been established in France, which will acquire all shares in the French groups via Newco Abylsen SAS and Nowjobs France II.
