_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not_
intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold,
distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the
“EEA”). For the purposes of this provision, the expression retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of the following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended from time to time, the “Insurance Mediation
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the
“Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended from time to time, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or
distributing the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities referred to
therein in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to therein.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in a Member State of notes which are
the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances
in which no obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the
issuer nor the initial purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of notes
in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the issuer or the initial purchasers to publish a
prospectus for such offer.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not_
intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold,
distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For the
purposes of this provision, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a


-----

professional client as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by
the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or
distributing the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation or the United Kingdom.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes referred to therein
in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending
to make an offer in the UK of notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering
Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the issuer or any of
the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in
each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the issuer nor the initial purchasers have authorized, nor do
they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the
issuer or any of the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

_UK MIFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the_
purposes of the product approval process of any relevant initial purchaser that considers itself a
manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance
Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (each a “UK Manufacturer” and, together,
the “UK Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led to the conclusion
that: (i) the target market for the notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook
Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the
notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into consideration the UK Manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible
for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining
the UK Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

This communication is directed solely at (i) persons who have professional experience in matters
relating to investments and are investment professionals as defined within Article 19(5) of the Financial

bodies corporate and any other person falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order, (iii) persons
outside the United Kingdom and (iv) any other persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage

2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated

investment or investment activity to which the Offering Memorandum relates is available only to
relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED DECEMBER 12, 2022**
**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

**Villa Dutch Bidco B.V.**

**€300 million         % Senior Secured Notes due 2029**

Villa Dutch Bidco B.V., a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) organized and existing under the laws of the Netherlands (the “Issuer”), is offering
(the “ Offering”) €300 million in aggregate principal amount of its       % Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The proceeds of the Offering will be used to, together with cash on hand, (i)
partially refinance amounts drawn under the Bridge Facility (as defined herein), the proceeds of which were used in connection with the financing for the acquisition of House of HR NV by the Issuer
and (ii) pay related fees and expenses.

The Notes will bear interest at a rate of         % per annum. The Notes will mature on        , 2029. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on         and         of
each year, commencing on        , 2023.

Prior to        , 2025, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a “make-whole” premium. At any time on or after        , 2025, the Issuer may
redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this preliminary offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). In addition, prior to        , 2025, the Issuer may redeem,
at its option, up to 40% of the Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings so long as at least 50% of the
original principal amount of the Notes (excluding any additional Notes), issued under the Indenture (as defined herein) remain outstanding. Prior to        , 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 10%
of the aggregate principal amount of the originally issued Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of
the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. Additionally, upon certain events defined as constituting a
change of control triggering event or upon certain asset sales, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes. A change of control triggering event, however, will not be deemed to
have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but
not less than all, of the Notes. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to
each other holder of Notes. See “ _Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, and will
rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein)
and the Bridge Facility. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed (the “Original Guarantee”) by Villa Dutch Finco B.V. (the “Original Guarantor”). Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles (as defined herein), the Notes will be guaranteed by the Post-Closing Guarantors (as defined herein) on a senior secured basis on or prior to March 3, 2023 (the “Post-Closing
Guarantees” and, together with the Original Guarantee, the “Note Guarantees”). The Guarantors (as defined herein) will also guarantee the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
Bridge Facility on a senior secured basis and the Second Lien Facility on a secured basis.

On the Issue Date, subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral (as defined herein) on a firstpriority basis. On or prior to March 3, 2023, subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by the PostClosing Collateral (as defined herein). The Collateral (as defined herein) will also secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility on a first-priority basis and
the Second Lien Facility on a second-priority basis. The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security and the liability of each Guarantor and security provider will be subject to
the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors.” The
security interests in favor of the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.

This Offering Memorandum includes more detailed information on the terms of the Notes and the Note Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices, security, covenants, events of default
and transfer restrictions.

as amended (the “Order”), (ii) high net worth bodies corporate and any other person falling within

may otherwise be lawfully communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together
being referred to as “relevant persons”).

This Offering Memorandum must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons.
Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to
relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Recipients of this Offering
Memorandum are not permitted to transmit it to any other person. The Notes are not being offered to
the public in the United Kingdom. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on
this Offering Memorandum or any of its contents.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: (i) it has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to
engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA
does not apply to the Issuer; and (ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of
the FSMA in respect of anything done by it in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving, the
United Kingdom.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes referred to herein
in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to herein. Accordingly, any
person making or intending to make an offer in the United Kingdom of Notes which are the subject of
the offering contemplated in this Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article
3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the
Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes in

-----

The Notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to
any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”);
or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made
under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document
required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under
the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any relevant Initial Purchaser that considers
itself a manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance
Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (each a “UK Manufacturer” and, together,
the “UK Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion
that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook
Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the
Notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into consideration the UK Manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible
for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining
the UK Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**European Economic Area**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made
available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available, any Notes that are the subject of the
Offering contemplated by this Offering Memorandum to any retail investor in the EEA. For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended from time to time, “MiFID II”) or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended from time to time, the “Insurance
Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (as amended from time to time, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key
information document required by the PRIIPS Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPS Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of
the Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This Offering Memorandum
is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a member state of the EEA
will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is not a retail investor. The Issuer,
the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing
representation, acknowledgement and agreement.

**MiFID II Product Governance / professional investors and eligible counterparties only target**
**market: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market**


-----

assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
“eligible counterparties” and “professional clients” only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

House of HR’s independent auditors; and

- the audited consolidated annual financial statements of House of HR as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2021, prepared in accordance with IFRS, and the related notes thereto,
including comparative information as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (the
“2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements” and together with the 2020 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”),
including the audit report thereon by the House of HR’s independent auditors.

In the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, we have restated the 2019 comparative column
in our consolidated income statement together with the supporting notes to make the financial
information set forth therein comparable with our 2020 consolidated income statement by reflecting the
impact of the disposal of GRITT Projects NV (“GRITT Projects”) which was divested in the first half
of 2020. The financial information as of and for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 contained
in this Offering Memorandum has been extracted or derived from the restated 2019 comparable column
in our 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Comparability of the Financial Statements_**

_Changes to Reportable Segments_

Prior to 2021, we structured our business and our reporting across three segments: engineering and
consulting, specialized staffing and general staffing. In the first quarter of 2021, we integrated our
legacy specialized staffing and general staffing segments into the current specialized talent solutions
segment. This integration involved the partial merger between TIMEPARTNER and Zaquensis in the
second quarter of 2021 through the creation of a new holding company, House of HR Germany GmbH,
which holds all shares in the TIMEPARTNER and Zaquensis entities. The former holding companies,
TIMEPARTNER Group Service GmbH and Zaquensis Holding GmbH, are shareholders of House of
HR Germany GmbH. The assets and liabilities of these holding companies have been hived down to
House of HR Germany GmbH. House of HR’s management believes that this segment reporting also
reflects better the strategy of House of HR towards becoming even more specialized in the Human
Resources solutions market. The ultimate purpose of the integration of these two segments is to better
focus on how to attract candidates and present our services to our client base.

As a result, since the first quarter of 2021, we have presented our results in two segments: engineering
and consulting and specialized talent solutions. Our financial information by segment for 2021 and any
subsequent period is therefore not directly comparable to the financial information by segment
presented in our 2020 Audited Financial Statements, or for any prior period.

We present the financial information by segment under the new structure in this Offering Memorandum.
Our financial information for the specialized talent solutions segment as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 represent the sum of the results of the legacy specialized staffing and
general staffing segments. As a result, such information may not be directly comparable with the
information included in our 2020 Financial Statements.

See note 6 to our 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

_Acquisitions and Disposals_

During the periods under review, we have made several acquisitions which have impacted our
consolidation perimeter. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Statements—_
_Acquisitions, Disposals and the Comparability of our Financial Statements” for the list of businesses_
that we have acquired during the periods under review. Acquired businesses are generally consolidated
from the date of their acquisition and the full impact of an acquisition is only reflected in our
consolidated financial statements in the subsequent financial year.

Additionally, we completed the disposal of GRITT Projects in June 2020 as its business model was not
aligned with our overall strategy and was not delivering the expected performance, which resulted in a
total loss of €19.6 million being recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020. See note 3.1 to each of
our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

As a result, our consolidated financial information may not be comparable following the date of such
acquisition or divestments.

_Impact of Covid-19_

The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our operations limits the comparability of our results as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2020 with our results as of and for the years ended December 31,
2019 and 2021, and may impact comparability with future periods. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of Covid-19.”_


-----

_Impact of the Transactions_

The Acquisition was completed on November 3, 2022. See “Summary—The Transactions.” None of
the financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been adjusted to reflect the impact of any
changes to the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows that might occur
as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. We will
account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3
(Business Combinations). The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying
values for existing assets and assets that may be added to the balance sheet, which may include
intangible assets, such as goodwill, brands, rights of use, contractual rights with franchisees leasehold
rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Only certain limited as
adjusted financial data of the Issuer is presented as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including
the Notes offered hereby. In addition, in connection with the Acquisition, French Bidco, a direct
subsidiary of the Issuer, acquired 70.8% of the share capital of Nowjobs France II SAS from a subsidiary
of House of HR and 100% of the share capital of ABY Engineering SAS, which in turn acquired 99.97%
of the share capital of NewCo Abylsen SAS from a subsidiary of House of HR. Subsequent to the
Acquisition Closing Date, the results of these entities will no longer be consolidated into the results of
House of HR. See “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.” In the future, we may
report our consolidated financial condition and results of operations at the level of the Issuer, or at
another entity, rather than at House of HR. Due to these and other potential adjustments, future financial
statements for the Group could be materially different and may not be comparable to our Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Basis of preparation_**

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared in
accordance with IFRS. See note 1 to each of the Financial Statements for further information.

**_Critical Accounting Estimates_**

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. These standards also require management to exercise its judgment in the process
of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in the
notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Business Unit Accounts**

Certain financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been presented on the basis of the
unaudited accounts of our business units (the “business unit accounts”). Certain of these business unit
accounts may include information from statutory audited accounts, but they are not covered by the audit
reports included in this Offering Memorandum and were prepared on a different basis from our Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements. The business unit accounts assume that any acquisitions undertaken
that are reported with that business unit were acquired as of January 1, 2019 and that any divestments
of business units were divested as of January 1, 2019 so that the management of our business units can
track the performance of the enlarged business unit post-acquisition on the same basis. Acquisitions
may take several months to integrate into the business unit accounts. Furthermore, the management of
our business units are responsible for identifying normalizations that should be reflected in the business
unit accounts, both in the statutory information that is integrated from acquisitions and after such
acquisition, as well as within the existing business units operation. We believe our approach on the
preparation of our business accounts facilitates management’s ability to track its key performance
indicators, since the impact of acquisitions and normalizations that occur are eliminated. Financial
information prepared on this basis has been referred to as business unit accounts or Pro Forma business
unit accounts in this Offering Memorandum. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and
_Industry—We have included certain historical financial information on entities that we acquired, which_


-----

_were not prepared by us or reviewed by our auditors and in some instances, which were not audited at_
_all, or which were prepared on a different basis from our current IFRS financial statements, which may_
_not be reflective of our past performance or representative of our future results.”_

**Statutory and management account information**

Certain financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been presented using unaudited
statutory or management accounts. Certain of these figures set out in this Offering Memorandum have
been computed by adding the revenues of all of our acquired entities to our historical statutory accounts
(prepared from 2008 to 2015 on a Belgian GAAP basis), to present the total revenues of House of HR,
as if it had been operating as a consolidated group at the relevant date. See “Business—Our Strengths—
_Outstanding performance throughout the cycle demonstrating highly resilient profile” for further_
information. The historical financial metrics for the acquired entities have been obtained from their
individual accounts, and are therefore not comparable to House of HR’s historical financial information.
Some of these accounts may not have been prepared in accordance with statutory requirements or the
accounting policies used by these acquired entities, and they may differ in substantial respects from the
manner in which we have prepared our accounts. This financial information may not reflect what our
results of operations or financial condition would have been had House of HR operated as a consolidated
group or reporting segment during the periods presented. A number of estimates, judgments and
assumptions were made for the purpose of allocating those items that were not directly attributable
and/or separately identifiable. This financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes
only and does not necessarily indicate what House of HR’s results of operations would have been had
we operated as a consolidated entity in the past with House of HR’s current consolidation perimeter,
nor do they purport to represent our future financial condition or results of operations. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We have included certain historical financial_
_information on entities that we acquired, which were not prepared by us or reviewed by our auditors_
_and in some instances, which were not audited at all, or which were prepared on a different basis from_
_our current IFRS financial statements, which may not be reflective of our past performance or_
_representative of our future results.”_

**Financial Information Presented for the Twelve Months ended September 30, 2022**

The summary unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended September 30,
2022 set forth in this Offering Memorandum was derived by adding House of HR’s consolidated
financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021 to its consolidated financial information
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and subtracting its consolidated financial information
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The summary unaudited consolidated financial
information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 has not been audited or reviewed and is
not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS and or any other generally accepted accounting
principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This information is not necessarily
representative of our results of operations for such period or any future period or any financial position
at any past or future date. See also “—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum also includes certain unaudited as adjusted financial information of the
Issuer as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, including as adjusted net senior
secured indebtedness, as adjusted net secured indebtedness, as adjusted net indebtedness and as adjusted
cash interest expense, which has been prepared to give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred
(i) on September 30, 2022, for the purposes of calculating as adjusted net senior secured indebtedness,
as adjusted net secured indebtedness and as adjusted net indebtedness and (ii) on October 1, 2021, for
the purposes of calculating as adjusted cash interest expense. See “Summary—Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information—As Adjusted Data of the Issuer” and “Capitalization.” The as_
adjusted financial information as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, has been
prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the Issuer’s indebtedness or interest


-----

expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on September 30, 2022 or October 1, 2021,
respectively, nor does it purport to project the Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense at any future
date. The as adjusted financial information as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022
has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions
underlying the adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information as of and for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2022, have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally
accepted auditing standards.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS
or any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the
face of the Financial Statements or in the footnotes thereto. The primary non-IFRS financial measures
used in this Offering Memorandum include EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, _Pro Forma_ Management
Adjusted Revenue, Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, M&A
capital expenditure, capital expenditures (excluding M&A capital expenditures), net capital
expenditures, Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow, Gross Margin, Organic Growth, Like-for-Like Revenue and
Like-for-Like EBITDA and certain leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures. Such nonIFRS measures and ratios may not reflect accurately our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur
debt and should not be considered as a substitute to net result or any other performance measures derived
from or in accordance with IFRS, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting
principles or as a substitute to net cash from/(used in) operating activities. The financial information
contained in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of
the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC.

As used in this Offering Memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings:

- “EBITDA” represents operating profit/(loss) plus the income statement line items for
depreciation and amortization, goodwill impairment, royalties and extraordinary items. The
income statement line items net change in depreciation, amortization and impairment include,
among others, depreciation of tangible assets, provisions for operational risks, disputes,
pensions, bad debt, overdue receivables, if any. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to operating
profit/(loss) for the period, see footnote (2) under “Summary—Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information— Summary Consolidated Other Financial and Pro Forma_
_Information.”_

- “EBITDA cash” represents EBITDA less lease payments.

- “EBITDA margin” represents EBITDA divided by revenue.

- “Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue” represents the revenue for the period presented
adjusted to reflect revenue generated by businesses acquired or divested during that period as
if those acquisitions or divestments had occurred on the first day of the period; therefore, the
consolidation perimeter for each period presented is different.

- “Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA” represents EBITDA as adjusted for the items set
forth in “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary
_Consolidated Other Financial and Pro Forma Information.” The consolidation perimeter for_
each period presented is different as described below under “—Organic Growth, Like-for-Like
_and Pro Forma Historical Information of the Company.”_

- “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” represents Like-for-Like EBITDA as further adjusted for the
items set forth in “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—
_Summary Consolidated Other Financial and Pro Forma Information.” The consolidation_


-----

perimeter for each period is presented on the same basis as described below under “—Organic
_Growth, Like-for-Like and Pro Forma Historical Information of the Company.”_

- “Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow” represents EBITDA cash less capital expenditures plus cash flow
from working capital changes.

- “Gross Margin” represents gross profit/(loss) divided by revenue.

- “Organic Growth” represents revenue growth between one financial period and the comparable
prior period, excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue as follows:

(a) in respect of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (compared against
the nine months ended September 30, 2021), we have excluded the impact of
acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January
1, 2021;

(b) in respect of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 (compared against the year
ended December 31, 2020), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue
by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2020; and

(c) in respect of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 (compared against the year
ended December 31, 2019), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue
by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019 or that
divestments have taken place as of January 1, 2019.

- “Like-for-Like Revenue” represents revenue adjusted to reflect our consolidation perimeter as
of a certain period as if such perimeter had been in place at the beginning of such relevant
period as described further under “—Organic Growth, Like-for-Like and Pro Forma Historical
_Information of the Company” below._

- “Like-for-Like EBITDA” represent EBITDA adjusted to reflect our consolidation perimeter as
of a certain period as if such perimeter had been in place at the beginning of each such relevant
period as described further under “—Organic Growth, Like-for-Like and Pro Forma Historical
_Information of the Company” below._

- “Capital expenditures” represents expenditures relating to the purchase of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets.

- “Net capital expenditures” represents capital expenditures including proceeds from property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets.

- “M&A capital expenditures” represents capital expenditures relating to paid consideration,
adjustments to purchase price and/or earn-outs for acquisition of subsidiaries (net of cash
acquired), settlement with shareholders, buy-out minorities and for acquisition of equity
investments, joint ventures and associates (net of cash acquired).

We present non-IFRS measures for information purposes only. There can be no assurance that items
we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will
not be incurred in the future. The calculations for Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions, including, in the case of_ _Pro Forma_
Adjusted EBITDA, successful implementation of certain initiatives and management or sponsor
estimates. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified
by any independent auditors’ firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It
may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations for the
periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum, and should not be relied upon when making an
investment decision.


-----

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they are helpful to investors as measures of our
operating performance and ability to service our debt, and that they and similar measures are widely
used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of
performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS
measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not
be considered as a substitute for revenue or net result for the period or any other performance or liquidity
measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as
a substitute to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. EBITDA and its variants as
presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from similarly titled measures used by other
companies and from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained and defined in the section entitled
“Description of the Notes” of this Offering Memorandum and in the Indenture. For a reconciliation of
EBITDA, Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer,
see “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary Consolidated
_Other Financial and Pro Forma Information.”_

The non-IFRS measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under
the Indenture. Some of the limitations of these non-IFRS measures are that:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to
service interest or principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider
not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA-based measures do not
reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;

- they may include adjustments for non-cash items and not adjust for all items that impact cash
flows;

- some of the items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures reflect cash
payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and

- other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting
their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, such metrics should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash
available to invest in the growth of the business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to
meet our obligations. In addition, any of our historical financial information does not take into account
any purchase price accounting or other adjustments to give effect to the Transactions and our
indebtedness will not be comparable to our indebtedness following the Transactions. See “—Historical
_Financial Information—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Impact of the Transactions” above_
and “Capitalization.” You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the IFRS
results and using these non-IFRS measures only as supplemental measures to evaluate the Group’s
performance. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information” and “Management’s


-----

_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Financial_
Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Organic Growth, Like-for-Like and Pro Forma Historical Information of the Company_**

We present Organic Growth in this Offering Memorandum in order to demonstrate our period-on-period
revenue growth on an organic basis excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue between one
financial period and the comparable prior period by assuming no acquisitions have occurred after the
start-date of the prior comparative period. We present Organic Growth:

- in respect of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (compared against the nine
months ended September 30, 2021), excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue by
assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2021;

- in respect of revenue for year ended December 31, 2021 (compared against the year ended
December 31, 2020), excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no
acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2020; and

- in respect of revenue for year ended December 31, 2020 (compared against the year ended
December 31, 2019), excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no
acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019 or that divestments have taken place as of
January 1, 2019.

We present Like-for-Like Revenue and Like-for-Like EBITDA in order to demonstrate our revenue and
EBITDA growth over a number of periods by adjusting each period to reflect all of the acquisitions that
have occurred as of a particular date as though such acquisitions had occurred on the first date of the
earliest comparative period. The financial information presented under “Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information” are adjusted to reflect our consolidated perimeter including all the_
acquisitions that had occurred as of September 30, 2022, as if such perimeter had been in place from
January 1, 2019. We also present Like-for-Like figures elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum using
different acquisition perimeters, which are adjusted to reflect our consolidated perimeter as of a certain
period as if such perimeter had been in place at the beginning of such relevant period.

_Pro Forma_ Management Adjusted Revenue and _Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA are_
adjusted to reflect the impact of acquisitions that occurred during that period as if they had occurred on
the first date of such period:

- for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, such figures are adjusted to reflect the impact
of the acquisitions of Bureau Brug, SOLCOM, TMI, BE-Consult, Atrium, Vijverberg, Sira
Consulting, Bis People, StaffMe, LD Personalvermittlung, and FID Service Groep as if they
had all been acquired on October 1, 2021;

- for the year ended December 31, 2021, such figures are adjusted to reflect the impact of the
acquisitions of avanti, Cohedron, Vanberkel Professionals, Bureau Brug, Solyne and
Greenworking, as if they had all been acquired on January 1, 2021;

- for the year ended December 31, 2020, such figures are adjusted to reflect the impact of the
acquisitions of TechMatch and Book’u as if they had all been acquired on January 1, 2020;

- for the year ended December 31, 2019, such figures are adjusted to reflect the impact of the
acquisitions of Eurojob, ETA, Mykelson and Pharmacos as if they had been acquired on
January 1, 2019;

- for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, such figures are adjusted to reflect the impact
of the acquisitions of SOLCOM, TMI, BE-Consult, Atrium, Vijverberg, Sira Consulting, Bis


-----

People, StaffMe, LD Personalvermittlung, and FID Service Groep as if they had all been
acquired on January 1, 2022; and

- for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, such figures are adjusted to reflect the impact
of the acquisitions of Solyne, Greenworking, avanti, Cohedron and Vanberkel Professionals as
if they had been acquired on January 1, 2021.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Acquisitions, Disposals and the Comparability of our Financial Statements.” As a result, for the twelve_
months ended September 30, 2022, Like-for-Like Revenue and Like-for-Like EBITDA based on our
consolidated perimeter as of September 30, 2022 are, respectively, the same figures as _Pro Forma_
Management Adjusted Revenue and Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA.

**Key Performance Indicators**

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements or accounting records, and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside
auditors, consultants or experts. A number of our key performance indicators relate to our business
units. Our business units are comprised of a variety of legal entities which are designated as a business
unit by us, typically on the basis of a common (i) management team; (ii) financial reporting unit; and
(iii) market specialization, which may include common specializations, international recruitment
network approaches, end-markets served or geographical presence. Our business units are those
presented in the tables in “Business—Our Service Offering—Two Staffing Segments and Digital” in this
Offering Memorandum. Our use or computation of these terms may not be comparable to the use or
computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of these terms should
not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS.

Our primary key performance indicators are defined as follows:

- “Bench time” represents the time for which job candidates are paid by us but cannot be billed
to a client linked to the unavailability of an assignment. Such time does not include any hours
linked to holiday, internal training or other matters. This also does not include any hours for
job candidates that were on the bench, but that were fully compensated by furlough measures
of the government. Bench time is expressed as an FTE using the working days per month
multiplied by eight hours per day;

- “Unique clients” for a period represents the sum of the number of our clients for each of the
operational entities that formed part of the consolidation perimeter as of the end of the period.
There may be duplication in the figures if different operational entities serve the same client or
if a client has multiple legal entities under which it does business and which are served by us;

- “In-house full-time equivalent employees” represent our employees that are not intended for
client assignments, such as our sales and marketing in-house employees. Full-time equivalent
measures the number of in-house employees as adjusted to reflect the portion of hours worked
in a period. An in-house employee on a 40-hour work week would represent one in-house fulltime equivalent employee for the period whereas an in-house employee on a 20-hour work
week would represent 0.5 full-time equivalent employee for the period;

- “Job candidates” include, for the relevant period, our individuals that we recruit for assignments
with clients, whether they be for temporary staffing positions, secondments or consulting roles.
Job candidates also refers to our engineers and consultants, freelancers and subcontractors that
are intended for assignments with clients;

- “Job candidates at work” or “people at work” represent any job candidate that has worked one
hour at a client during the period indicated. Job candidates at work include our engineers and


-----

consultants, freelancers and subcontractors as well as job candidates with an indefinite or
temporary employment agreement with us (whether or not they worked one hour with a client
during the applicable period);

- “Productive job candidates” or “productive people at work” represent job candidates working
at the customer premises, expressed in full time equivalents;

- “Total Market” represents the estimated total market size in 2021 expressed in terms of revenue,
which encompassed the staffing market in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France;

- “Addressable Market” represents the portion of our Total Market which has been narrowed
down to reflect the estimated market size, expressed in terms of revenue, for each of our
business units according to the particular staffing, sourcing or consulting services for the
particular clients, industrial and geographic end-markets that each such business unit serves.
To narrow the Total Market, we identified competitors that provide similar services to our own
within the niches in which we often operate. Clients or others familiar with the market were
also consulted for this purpose. Using these additional sources, the Addressable Market relating
to our particular business units were estimated. These estimates have their limitations and may
not align with how other market participants view the size of our niche markets; and

- “market position” represents our share of revenue of the Addressable Market of our business
units, except where otherwise indicated. These market positions are higher than if we were to
focus on the more general and broad markets in which we operate as measured by the Total
Market.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or in thousands, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the
data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information. In addition, as a result of such rounding, the totals of certain financial information
presented in tabular form may differ from the information that would have appeared in such totals using
the unrounded financial information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods
relating to financial and other information set forth in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and are calculated using the unrounded numerical data_
in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements or the tabular presentation of other information
contained in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative
description thereof.

In respect of financial data set forth in the main body of this Offering Memorandum, a dash (“—”)
signifies that the relevant figure is not available, while a zero (“0”) signifies that the relevant figure is
available but has been rounded to zero. By contrast, no such differentiation has been made in respect of
the financial data set forth in the financial information section of this Offering Memorandum beginning
on page F-1.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the
various markets or regions in which we operate and compete. Unless otherwise stated, all information
regarding markets, market size, market position, growth rates and other industry data contained in this
Offering Memorandum is based on our own estimates about the industry in which we operate, as well
as the Issuer’s analysis of facts and information derived from internal surveys, market research,
customer feedback, publicly available information and industry publications, including from the

**Overview**

We are a leading provider of HR solutions in key European staffing markets, offering end-to-end
temporary recruiting and outsourcing services. We supply specialized and niche staffing to primarily
small and medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) clients in a diversified range of end-markets. We offer and
tailor our services to the staffing needs of our clients through our engineering and consulting segment
and specialized talent solutions segment, which are comprised of a well-developed portfolio of ten
specialized business units, which we call Powerhouses, across various countries. We also offer digital
recruiting through our dedicated platforms, using our digital tools, including, NOWJOBS, SWOP and
Gighouse app, targeting low-skilled, high-volume markets with significant roll-out potential.

Since our founding, we have expanded from a presence in only Belgium to more than 10 countries in
Europe. Corresponding to our geographic expansion, we have also become more diversified in the endmarkets we serve, primarily through our acquisitions in recent years, which provide us with staffing
capabilities in additional areas such as pharmaceutical, healthcare, life sciences, government and public
administration and technology. As of September 30, 2022, we had 72,296 job candidates at work and
approximately 40,858 productive people at work (meaning the number of our job candidates adjusted
to reflect a 38 hour per week workweek) and 4,734 in-house full-time equivalent employees. For the
twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we had 31,456 unique clients, our Pro Forma Management
Adjusted Revenue was €2,770.0 million and our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA was_
€330.5 million.

Our engineering and consulting segment represents 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022. This segment supplies staffing of highly-skilled professionals, such as engineering
consultants and financial and insurance specialists, to fill specialized roles in a variety of end-markets,
such as financial, industrial, logistics, infrastructure, public administration and construction, and, more
recently, fast-evolving and highly resilient sectors such as energy, telecommunications,
pharmaceuticals and technology. This segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu Professionals,
Redmore, GRITT, Cohedron and SOLCOM Powerhouses and has the broadest geographic footprint,
with its primary operations in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The engineering and
consulting segment assists clients in the search and selection of the right candidate, including for interim
management and secondments, and such temporary client assignments generally last for months. The
below chart illustrates in blue the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for
our engineering and consulting segment.


-----

Our specialized talent solutions segment represents 46.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022. This segment supplies specialized staffing of high-demand mid-skilled workers
for specialized positions, such as clerical positions, carpenters, nurses and machine engineers, as well
as blue-collar workers to companies in certain sectors, including construction, retail, finance, food,
healthcare and construction. This segment is comprised of our Accent, Covebo, TIMEPARTNER and
TMI Powerhouses, with their primary operations in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as
branches in countries that form part of their international recruiting networks, which currently operate
principally for this segment though we are planning to expand them for our engineering and consulting
segment. These international branches provide us with the capability to source foreign candidates to
bridge the large gap between the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates,
especially as the labor market in our Addressable Markets has tightened over the past few years. The
Specialized Talent Solution segment generally delivers job candidates through temporary agencies to
clients in a fast and flexible way when they are shorthanded, with duration of job placements typically
lasting for weeks, but they could also last hours or months depending on the needs of our clients. The
below chart illustrates in pink the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for
our Specialized Talent Solution segment.

We serve as an intermediary between job candidates and their ultimate employer by matching up
candidates that are looking to find a job, gain experience or find variety or flexibility with our clients
that are looking for specialist skills, flexible employee arrangements, time and cost efficiencies or to
cover peaks or sourcing for particular projects. We source and screen candidates, provide candidate
matching services and present candidates to the client. We also assist with the hiring of the candidates
by customers, client and candidate retention, provide timesheet, invoicing and payroll services, and
regularly follow up with clients. We aim to help our clients at all stages of the recruiting process to
relieve their management from the burden of having to seek appropriate job candidates for available
positions. To ensure that we are able to tap into skilled workforces, we offer career coaching to job
candidates in order to help them find career paths that align with their professional goals, and we provide
in-house training to equip them to match the job profiles in which they are interested or that are scarce
in the market to increase job candidates’ employability. We also offer support to foreign job candidates,
including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance.

We enter into employment contracts with the candidates and pay their salaries. We enter into placement
contracts with our clients and bill our clients for our services. Our bill-pay spread is a key driver of our
profitability and supports our industry-leading gross margins. We maximize bill-pay spread as a result
of candidate scarcity, our niche focus, our SME and local customer focus, our premium service offering,
our excellence in marketing candidates to jobs and non-solicitation or minimum fee/period protection
for candidates in respect of clients. We have strong pricing power driven by contractual dynamics that
ensure pass-through of salary increases. Our specialized talent solutions segment benefits from
contractual dynamics which allow for an automatic pass-through to clients of price increases, and our
business model also allows for limited bench risk because staffing contracts are back-to-back. In our
engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with
our clients, and we effectively manage to keep our bench time low by matching confirmed upcoming
client assignments to candidates. The business model of these two segments has enabled us to establish
a track record of margin stability even during challenging economic conditions such as the Covid-19
pandemic and in the inflationary environment in 2022.


-----

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we generated 27.6%, 39.8%, 26.0% and 5.5% of our
_Pro Forma_ Management Adjusted Revenue in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France,
respectively. We have branches in the countries where we source job candidates, including Poland,
Romania, Spain, Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal. As of September 30, 2022, we had a network
of 742 branches and 18 recruitment offices. To complement our physical network of branches and reach
new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies, including our SWOP
application, our SWOP Recruiter application and our NOWJOBS platform. We have increased our
focus on developing digital support growth initiatives for our primary operations to enable us to reach
additional job candidates or serve new end-markets in a fully digital manner.

We support businesses by providing flexible staffing solutions that are used throughout all stages of the
economic cycle, resulting in our resilience during economic downturns. While the economy is strong,
the job market tightens meaning that our clients need help sourcing candidates. As markets soften,
companies typically shift to a more temporary workforce and need staffing solutions and flexibility.
When markets reach the bottom of the cycle, temporary staffing suffers but then is characterized by a
quick recovery as temporary employment tends to recover faster than permanent employment. For
example, during the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, our business recovered from the early losses in
approximately three to six weeks. We also have a highly variable cost base and the ability to pass on
wage inflation, which supports the stability of our gross margins. For example, our Like-for-Like
Revenue growth (based on the December 31, 2021 perimeter) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 fluctuated
significantly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and were 2%, (9)% and 19%, respectively,
but we were able to maintain a gross margin of approximately 28% throughout this period. Flexible
staffing solutions proved instrumental in the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic,
resulting in a full recovery of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the Covid-19
pandemic, the retail, food retail and hospitality sectors were severely impacted across all our key
markets due to lockdowns and other restrictive measures, which led to a significant reduction in our
staffing activities in these sectors. Certain sectors, such as logistics and education, however, proved to
be less sensitive to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, and clients in these sectors continued to seek
our services, particularly for high-skilled, specialized roles. In addition, demand for staffing services
from municipalities and government agencies during the Covid-19 pandemic increased due to, among
other developments, work related to the administration of government support measures, which we were
able to capitalize on given our specialization in this end-market provided by the Cohedron Powerhouse
in our engineering and consulting segment.

We were founded in 1995 by Philip Cracco and Conny Vandendriessche along with a financial sponsor
as a Belgium-based recruiting firm. Originally called Accent, we changed our name to House of HR in
2012. Over the course of 2012 to 2014, Naxicap, a French private equity firm, acquired a majority stake
in our business, and we have expanded significantly to become a leading provider of specialized HR
solutions in multiple European markets. On November 3, 2022, Bain Capital acquired a majority stake
in the Group, with Naxicap, Conny Vandendriessche and management maintaining stakes. See “—The
_Transactions.”_

**Our Strengths**

We believe we benefit from the following key strengths:

**_Operating in highly resilient markets with favorable tailwinds and structural demand dynamics_**

The HR solutions market has historically shown quick recovery in demand following periods of
economic downturns. The general temporary staffing market, as a whole, has a long-term positive GDP
growth trajectory and tends to recover quickly after an economic downturn. Within this market,
specialized staffing companies, like us, also benefit from higher resiliency than generalist staffing
companies that rely on the low value-add mass labor market. Specialized staffing companies benefit
from lower cyclicality compared to generalist staffing companies due to specialty profiles. Specialized
staffing companies also benefit from increased penetration with clients compared to generalist staffing


-----

companies due to more clients in these specialized sectors turning to staffing solutions providers like
us to assist them with candidate searches and provide them with higher value-add solutions. The below
graph demonstrates the relative resilience of the specialist temporary staffing companies:

________________________________
Note: Specialists include Alten, Amadeus, Assystem, Page and Robert Half, and Generalists include Adecco, Manpower, Randstad.

European Union and national regulations applicable in the key countries in which we operate tend to
reinforce protection of permanent workers, which can lead companies to favor temporary work and
outsourcing solutions as employers often prefer to hire on a more temporary basis before offering an
employee a permanent contract. This trend is especially evident in recovery periods after a trough in
the economic cycle as companies seek to scale up their workforce. For example, we were able to quickly
recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with our sales fully recovering to pre-Covid 19
levels during 2021. At the same time, legislation in the countries in which we principally operate allows
for multiple temporary staffing solutions, further supporting our business model.

We believe that high job vacancy rates offer us strong protection from a potential downturn in the nearterm as there would still be significant numbers of unfilled positions even with a reduction in vacancies,
which is similar to reductions that occurred during recent downturns. We offer our clients the ability to
recruit job candidates with specific profiles for jobs that are particularly difficult to fill, including from
abroad where needed, as we draw upon an international talent pool and provide required training. We
operate in markets where fundamentals for businesses such as ours are improving over time, supported
both by macroeconomic factors and positive structural demographic dynamics. Western Europe
generally is experiencing a large, chronic and growing supply and demand gap for skilled employees,
particularly related to technical engineering, specialized consulting and specialized blue-collar labor,
obliging companies to look beyond traditional job candidate sourcing and seek the help of specialized
staffing solutions providers like us. For example, unemployment rates in Germany were at 3.5% in
2021, as compared to 8.7% in 2007. In the Netherlands and Belgium, they were at 4.0% and 6.4%,
respectively, in 2021 as compared to a recent peak of 7.4% and 8.5%, respectively, in 2014. Job
vacancies in Belgium were at their highest in the second quarter of 2022 since 2012, and in Germany
and the Netherlands were at their highest in the second and third quarters of 2022, respectively, since
2007.

The staffing industry also benefits from a number of long-term underlying trends that have supported
our industry’s historical and projected medium- to long-term growth. Demand for the types of solutions
we provide is expected to continue growing in the future due to a number of positive secular trends,
including:

- Aging populations in our target markets and increasing competition for talent;

- Technological changes to job candidates’ search for employment opportunities, including the
switch to mobile technology, that are more challenging for employers to handle in-house;


-----

- Workers increasingly prioritizing career mobility and focusing on smaller, entrepreneurial
opportunities;

- The need for workers to train or re-skill to adapt to changing work opportunities;

- The desire of companies to address issues relating to diversity, inclusion and corporate social
responsibility;

- Workers placing an increased premium on quality of life and happiness at both a personal and
professional level, and an increased preference for job flexibility, especially since the Covid19 pandemic, leading to increased job rotation;

- Financial pressures resulting in increased outsourcing and offshoring; and

- Increasing use of artificial intelligence, data mining and robotization, as well as technological
change, all of which contribute to the skill supply-demand gap in labor markets.

- Especially for freelance workers, the prospect of better economics in spite of lower job security.

As a result of these secular trends, both employers and workers increasingly turn towards flexible
staffing models, driving demand for extended workforce solutions. According to an external consultant
analysis, in Belgium, Netherlands and France, the number of workers that are part of the extended
workforce (i.e., contractors and other freelancers) has grown from 2016 to 2021 at a CAGR of 3.9%,
2.5% and 4.4%, respectively. These growth rates are above those registered in the total working
population, which over the same period has grown at a CAGR of 1.0% in Belgium, 1.3% in the
Netherlands and 0.4% in France. This is also evidenced by the growth in penetration of the extended
workforce as part of the total workforce, with penetration rates in 2021 ranging from 7.2% in France to
10.2% in the Netherlands. We believe we are well positioned to capture penetration in specialized
extended labor.

These underlying trends contribute to the complexity of job searches and encourage companies to turn
to staffing solutions providers like us to help them fulfill their staffing needs. In addition, they make it
more challenging for new market entrants to effectively compete with established providers like us. We
have strategically positioned ourselves in geographic markets that are supported by macroeconomic
factors and positive demand dynamics in order to take full advantage of favorable trends. We believe
that the fundamentals of our Addressable Market remain strong in the medium-term and we believe that
we are poised to continue growing at or above the industry average growth rate in the future due to our
business model.

**_Increasingly diversified exposure to resilient and profitable end-markets targeting highly loyal and_**
**_less price-sensitive SME clients, with a focus on scarcity-driven specialist candidates_**

Our client focus is centered on SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises that require high-touch local
service and operate in specialty niches that are in high demand. This focus supports our above market
growth and margins and provides us resilience as a result of the critical nature of the positions sought
by our clients. We believe that SMEs represent a particularly attractive client base as they are generally
more loyal customers and are less price sensitive. SMEs tend to be more reliant on each employee and
have lower workforce anticipation capabilities than large corporates, so the absence of a single worker
can be critical. As a result, when they need to hire someone, they need someone fairly quickly and place
a premium on the ability to source job candidates within their time constraints. As SMEs may have
more limited or no in-house recruiting capabilities, they are more willing to outsource many of their
staffing-related needs to providers like us who can provide a full service offering at all stages of the
recruitment lifecycle. SMEs often have limited employer branding and therefore may experience
difficulty in reaching the best job candidates without access to the talent pool of a staffing solutions
provider. SMEs also often have a faster decision-making process compared to large corporates and lack
purchasing departments, so we may face less pricing pressure from such companies. In addition, SMEs,


-----

due to the smaller size of their employee pools, are less likely to lay off workers in a downturn and
typically maintain a more consistent level of employment than larger companies during a downturn.
The stability of employee levels at SMEs was evident during the global financial crisis as, based on
information from Accent, employment volumes were resilient at small companies and demonstrated
growth from 2008 to 2016.

We have a track record of serving the attractive SME segment, with a focus on scarcity-driven specialist
candidates. We believe that the ability to find a specific candidate with the right cultural fit is important
for SMEs, since they typically have small teams and often seek a particular candidate who is not only
qualified for the job, but also matches the client’s corporate culture. Our ability to match such job
candidates results from our blend of human and digital touchpoints, with regular interaction with clients
and job candidates throughout the recruitment lifecycle (including our international recruiting
capabilities). HR staffing solutions also operate in a complex regulatory environment, and we provide
our clients with the required specific knowledge by sector, geography and even region. We believe the
ability to manage this complexity on a large scale increases the barriers to entry for the sector and
diminishes the risk for digital disruption or disintermediation.

In addition to our focus on SMEs, we focus on specialist candidates, which provides further resilience
to our business as skilled jobs are less cyclical. For example, in France, the unemployment rate for
unskilled jobs has had an approximately 8% variation between 2000 and 2020 as compared to a rate of
approximately 2% for skilled workers as demonstrated by the chart below.

Note: Based on France. Skilled works are defined as those with two years of post-high school diploma education (baccalaureate) and unskilled
workers are defined as those who hold no diploma

In particular, we focus on specialty niches that are in high demand and that support higher revenue
growth and margins than generalist staffing. We market our services under brands that relate to specific
specialized services offered by our Powerhouses or sub business-unit or brands under a Powerhouse,
which we call Boutiques. Our multiple brand approach has proven effective in attracting and retaining
clients and candidates. For example, our Facebook page of Accent currently has, in most instances,


-----

almost twice the number of followers (61.0K) than the Facebook pages of our competitors Randstad
Belgium (27.0K), RGF Staffing (Start People) (35.0K) or Adecco Belgium (39.0K) as of November
2022.

We also benefit from having diversified our business activities towards more resilient end-markets and
job candidate profiles. Our new business structure is reflective of our strategy, which is geared towards
moving away from general staffing to a more specialized staffing focus. For the year ended December
31, 2018, our business mix included more of a focus on general staffing, with 15% of our Pro Forma
Management Adjusted EBITDA coming from our general staffing segment, 46% from our engineering
and consulting segment and 39% from our specialized staffing segment (based on our consolidation
perimeter for 2018) whereas for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 53.5% of our Pro Forma
Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) was
attributable to our engineering and consulting segment and 46.5% was attributable to our specialized
talent solution segment (which includes general staffing). We also have actively increased our endmarket mix to focus on public sector, IT and telecommunications, healthcare, food and financial and
legal end-markets, which are more resilient throughout the economic cycle. The below chart shows our
revenue for the year ended December 2018 by end-market compared to our Pro Forma Management
Adjusted Revenue by end-market for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Through our business segments and brands in our core geographies, we provide HR solutions that meet
most of the critical job shortages in those markets. Our focus on niche and specialty staffing highlights
the added value we can provide to companies looking for specific job candidate profiles which are often
difficult to find, and in our experience, clients are willing to attach a premium to such services. Our
focus on niche and specialty staffing also enables us to recruit and retain qualified job candidates. Even
when we serve large corporate clients, we believe our provision of specialized staffing solutions enables
us to maintain pricing power as a result of the quality of and demand for our job candidates.


-----

We believe that our geographic footprint, branch density and our ability to recruit internationally are
challenging to replicate and are essential to fostering the client relationships and granular geographic
reach necessary to reach our targeted SME and specialty-focused clients. We maintain and have access
to a large database of job candidates to enable short matching times and have acquired in-depth endmarket experience through selective organic and external growth over many years, which facilitates our
ability to source, match and retain job candidates and clients in our key markets.

**_Outstanding performance throughout the cycle demonstrating highly resilient profile_**

We have grown our business over recent years both organically and through targeted, strategic and
value-accretive acquisitions. From 2008 to 2021, our Like-for-Like Revenue grew at a compound
annual growth rate of 7.8%. We believe that our largely consistent positive Like-for-Like Revenue
growth in each business segment and for the pro forma perimeter outperforms the market and evidences
the success of our differentiated business model. In addition, we achieved Organic Growth of 19.9% in
the year ended December 31, 2021, and 17.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our Likefor-Like Revenue growth across the various stages of the economic cycle from 2008 demonstrates the
resilience of our revenues and our ability to recover from economic downturns at a more rapid rate than
GDP. We have been able to maintain strong EBITDA margins even through challenging
macroeconomic conditions. The chart below portrays our Like-for-Like Revenue growth from 2008 to
the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 showing our organic and external growth and our
EBITDA margins, including the unaudited business unit accounts of Accent, as well as those of our
other business units, on the basis as described in the notes below.

including during the global financial crisis in 2008 and the Covid-19 pandemic, demonstrating the
resilience of our business model. The below graph illustrates our Like-for-Like Revenue growth across
the various economic cycles.

We also have a strong track record of external growth through highly accretive acquisitions in a
fragmented market. We approach our growth through acquisitions with rigorous discipline. We focus
on acquiring successful, profitable companies rather than turn-around acquisitions. Our evaluation of a
potential acquisition target includes reviewing the opportunity through the rubric of a number of
stringent requirements designed to ensure fit with our overall strategy and culture. The target must fit
an identified strategic need to expand our geographic coverage, complement a specific specialty or fill
a niche skill gap. We also seek out targets with like-minded management teams with an entrepreneurial
spirit and long-term commitment in order to ensure a strong overall cultural fit. We also evaluate the
target’s profitability, historic growth and other performance metrics, and assess whether it is a leader in
its addressable markets. Once we have identified and then acquired a target, we have a well-defined and
proven integration process that involves consolidating the target into our Group reporting system and
sharing best practices. Local management teams are given the opportunity to invest at group level or to
continue to invest at the local level. We have completed 42 transactions since 2018, comprised of bolton acquisitions with lower multiples that enable growth at the local level, as well as platform
acquisitions through which we expand our solutions and enter new specialties or markets. We have an
excellent integration track record with our targets’ EBITDA and revenue growing by approximately 8%
per annum and 10% on average after we integrated them, as demonstrated by our acquisitions of
Abylsen, Covebo, Continu, TIMEPARTNER and Redmore. See “Business—Engineering and
_Consulting” and “Business—Specialized Talent Solutions.”_

**_Reference player in target markets with proven track record of above-market performance delivering_**
**_higher margins driven by highly incentivized management team_**


-----

We occupy leading positions across the highly fragmented markets in which we operate. Many of our
operating companies are reference players within their respective specialty, benefiting from the virtuous
cycle of competitive leadership, with their track record, enabling them to capture a high percentage of
their market growth and benefiting from brand loyalty and pricing power as a result. The table below
shows our relative market positioning vis-à-vis our peers:

(1) Based on a numerical mean of revenue growth percentage of each entity. For peers based on last four to five years average, apart
from local players (based on 2019 excluding Assystem), and with respect to House of HR, based on over the cycle performance.

(2) For each peer, based on a numerical mean of latest publicly available EBITDA margin (post IFRS-16) as a percentage and with
respect to House of HR, based on the results of operation for 2021.

Based on Net Promoter Scores, we are the most recommended HR solutions provider by customers in
the Netherlands and second most recommended HR solutions provider by SME customers in Belgium.
In addition, based on Google reviews, we are the most recommended HR solutions provider by job
candidate in Belgium and second most recommended HR solutions provider by job candidates in the
Netherlands. Our clients make staffing decisions at a local level and our large footprint with high branch
density allows us to be physically present in the communities where our clients operate, meaning that
clients have a familiarity with our brand at a local level, which provides a key competitive advantage
for us.

We believe we are unique among our peers and that this is reflected in our performance compared to
certain of our competitors. Our Like-for-Like Revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 8% from 2008 to 2021 (based on our 2020 consolidation perimeter excluding avanti,
Cohedron, SOLCOM and TMI and including Solyne and Greenworking) as compared to the Organic
Growth average (weighted by business mix) of our peer benchmark, including Adecco, Randstad and
Alten, which grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% during the same period. In
addition, we have a track record of significant growth above market, with nominal GDP growing at
annual compound growth rate of approximately 1% from 2008 to 2021 (based on the nominal GDP
growth for the Eurozone) and the volume of the number of temporary workers (based on a weighted
average of publicly available information in Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands) having a
negative annual compound growth rate during the same period. We also enjoyed best-in-class
profitability compared to our specialist and generalist peers. This is demonstrated by the below chart
comparing our EBITDA margins on a total basis, for our engineering and consulting segment and for


-----

our specialized staffing solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the EBITDA
margins of some of our specialist and generalist peers for the same period.

We believe our above-market performance is driven by our strong entrepreneurial culture and local
incentivization model. We operate on a strong incentivization model with fast promotion opportunities,
including opportunities to open new branches where a manager generates new business. Our variable
bonus systems are intended to encourage growth and bonuses as we do not have bonus caps. Variable
pay can represent up to 50% of the salary package for our employees, including the management of our
business units, branch managers, sales consultants and recruitment consultants. The below chart
illustrates the potential pay for one of our account managers on a base salary of €33,000 as compared
to an account manager on a base salary of €35,000 at one of our competitors, which demonstrates the
additional opportunities provided by us.

We believe our model encourages winning behaviors from our employees, driven by an owner mindset.
We have highly invested top-level and mid-level managers, with 412 managers having reinvested
approximately 63% of the net proceeds received from the Acquisition in the new structure, which
confirms their belief in House of HR and our business model. Including new joiners, currently
approximately 500 members of management are invested in the company. Such investment encourages
employees to focus on building relationships, both with clients and candidates, which helps to support
our performance. We also typically offer an appealing value proposition to managers of the businesses
we acquire by allowing these individuals to retain autonomy over their respective entities’ operations,
including brand and identity, while allowing them to benefit from central support on complex regulatory
and compliance topics, access to our foreign sourcing network and digital platforms and access to our
financing. We also offer such managers an incentive structure tied to, where possible, both their own
company’s and our overall results. We believe that this streamlines the integration process and helps to
align the management of our acquisition targets with our central management. Together with the support
of our new sponsor, Bain Capital, we replaced our long-term incentive plan, which was settled on or
about the Acquisition Closing Date, with a new one on the Acquisition Closing Date in order to maintain
our culture of incentivization and increase employee commitment and engagement. We also believe


-----

that our long-term incentive plan allows for succession planning for key roles by incentivizing key staff
to remain with the business and by enabling potential reinvestments in the equity of House of HR going
forward.

**_Ability to pass through wage increases to customers, including through automatic contractual_**
**_mechanisms, and stable margins_**

We have the ability to pass through wage increases from inflation to customers in both our engineering
and consulting segment and our specialized talent solutions segment, which, coupled with our flexible
cost structure, has resulted in resilient gross margins. While our gross margins in both of our segments
fluctuate somewhat as a result of seasonality around holiday periods, they have remained largely stable
since January 2019 at approximately 22% to 28% (depending on Powerhouses and specialties) for our
specialized talent solutions segment and approximately 30% to 37% for our engineering and consulting
segment. Our revenues typically correlate with nominal GDP rather than real GDP due to our ability to
pass through wage increases in an inflationary environment and stable margins.

In our specialized talent solutions segment, price increases are automatically passed through to our
clients. For this segment, our contract model is centered on matching the length of our candidate’s
employment contract with us to the length of our placement contract with our client, the ultimate
employer, in order to prevent lag time between inflation of gross salary paid to the candidate and the
cost we charge to our clients, which results in an automatic pass-through of any salary increases. As
contracts expire, we renegotiate them, which has historically resulted in an ability to increase our prices
in line with wage inflation. We base our contract pricing on a candidate’s gross salary multiplied by a
coefficient factor, with the split typically being transparent to the client. Our coefficient factors tend to
remain relatively stable with slight fluctuations as a result of seasonality around holiday periods. For
example, Accent’s coefficient factor has remained relatively stable since 2020 at an average of 2.2.

The key pricing drivers for the coefficient factor are the scarcity of candidates and the value of any
additional services we offer. Key costs for us include salaries and work accident insurance. At the end
of the contract period, typically one week or one month in length, if salary increases, then we charge
the cost of the higher salary to the client. During the first half of 2022, we achieved average price
increases of approximately 5.0% (calculated as the numerical mean of the average price increases across
certain Powerhouses, weighted equally). Growth in euro-per-hour billed in our specialized talent
solutions segment is driven by increasing cost per hour paid and billed, as well as through increasing
bench costs. Our gross margin per hour billed remained highly stable at approximately 23% to 25%
(including bench costs) and approximately 29% to 30% (excluding bench costs) for each of the nine
months ended September 30, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as shown in the below chart.

-----

1 Excluding Atrium and BE-Consult given ongoing integration.

In our engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations
with clients. The contracts are typically time and material contracts with no obligations for any specific
result. Most of our candidates in our engineering and consulting segment are permanently hired by us
using employment contracts that typically have three- to six-week notice periods. We have placement
contracts with our clients that typically last nine to twelve months, which allows us to effectively
manage bench time and match our candidates with the upcoming mandates from clients. In most cases,
we plan for salary increases in advance and negotiate rate increases with our clients accordingly. Our
pricing model in our engineering and consulting segment centers on charging the client an hourly or
daily rate. Our billing rate is typically based on an hourly wage and a mark-up where the split is usually
not transparent to clients. Since 2021, we have been able to consistently increase our hourly rate in this
segment. For example, at Talent&Pro, one of our Redmore Boutiques that focuses on the finance
industry staffing, although our hourly rate fluctuated between €46.8 and €48.1 per hour during the
course of 2020, by the end of December 2021 we were able to increase it to approximately €49.6, and
have continued to increase it during the course of 2022, with an hourly rate of €53.5 as of September
2022.

Key drivers of the hourly or daily rates are skills, seniority and scarcity of candidates. Our key costs
include salary, potentially including a company car. At the end of a placement contract, renewal either
entails replacing the candidate with a new or more junior person at a new price or placing the same
candidate, who is now more senior, at a higher price. During the first half of 2022, we achieved average
price increases of approximately 6.6% (calculated as the numerical mean of the average price increases
across certain Powerhouses, weighted equally). Margin growth in our engineering and consulting
segment is driven by increasing the cost per hour paid and billed. Bench-time risk is effectively managed
by matching confirmed upcoming client assignments to candidates. Our gross margin per hour billed in
this segment also remained stable at approximately 32% to 34% (including bench costs) and
approximately 45% to 47% (excluding bench costs) for each of the nine months ended September 30,
2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.

**_Robust financial profile supports cash generation with a highly variable cost base and proven ability_**
**_to deleverage_**

Our business model has supported strong EBITDA growth and profitability. We demonstrated our
financial resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic with strong EBITDA margins of 11%, 10% and 12%
for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and 11% for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively. We have limited capital expenditure requirements (primarily related


-----

to IT investments and expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles,
primarily related to our headquarters, furniture and infrastructure for our branch network,
accommodation for foreign job candidates, company cars) of approximately 1% of revenue in each of
2019, 2020 and 2021. As our key assets are the talent we provide to meet the temporary staffing needs
of our clients, we have limited fixed assets or cash tied up in inventory. Working capital largely consists
of receivables (client billings) and payables (job candidate wages, social security, etc.) tied to individual
job candidate placements. The receivable for each job candidate placement is typically higher than the
payable with the difference roughly representing the bill-pay spread or gross margin embedded in the
client service agreement and job candidate agreement. Working capital as a percentage of sales for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2022, was 4.9% of sales, compared to 2.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The working capital dynamics and corresponding downside protection for our cash
flows are also evident in our recent performance. As volumes of job candidates reduce, for instance,
during period of economic downturns, we benefit from significant working capital inflows, which gives
us strong cash resiliency. In 2020, we experienced a positive change in working capital demonstrating
the counter-cyclical nature of our working capital profile. As a result, we experience high cash
conversion and cash flow growth, which has, in turn, supported our business growth, and has in the
past, allowed us to deleverage on a net debt basis following each of our refinancings. The following
chart shows our Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow and our Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow as a percentage of EBITDA
cash for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

We also benefit from a flexible cost structure, with approximately 95% of our costs being variable or
semi-variable allowing for highly stable gross margins through the cycle. For 2021, approximately
65.1% of our total operating expenses were variable, 31.7% were semi-variable and 3.2% were fixed
costs. Our cost of services, which represented 79.1% of our total operational expenses (cost of services
and operating expenses together) for the year ended December 31, 2021, is comprised of mostly variable
costs related to our people at work (mainly payroll, social security contributions, housing, car fleet and
subcontracting costs). Our direct costs linked to our branches are primarily semi-variable and include
staff costs, including costs of managers and recruiters, and branch expenses, such as rents, car leases
and training, marketing and communication costs. Our overheads related to corporate functions at both
an operating company and Group-level, which represented less than 5% of our total operating expenses,
consists primarily of fixed costs. Further, due to our back-to-back contract model, we experience limited
bench risk in respect of people at work. In many of our jurisdictions, we are able to match the duration
of the employment of our job candidates and their placement, allowing us to be flexible in the
deployment of our job candidate resources. As costs generally track revenue, costs of service as a
percentage of revenue, and as a result, our margins, generally remain stable during downturns, as
demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic.

**_We are well-protected from disruption by other digital players and have developed an emerging_**
**_platform for excellent proprietary digital offering_**

We have an excellent proprietary digital offering and based on interviews with market participants we
believe we are well-protected from disruption from typical digital players that focus on a low-skilled,
higher volume business. We believe we are differentiated from such market participants because our
core offering is focused on specialty staffing and focused on SMEs that require customized services,
which are much more difficult to standardize or automate.

We believe that we are a thought leader and ahead of our larger peers in many respects as a result of
our development of digital initiatives in order to both address new markets with innovative business
models and improve our own and existing operations. To complement our physical network of branches
and reach new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies that are revenuegenerating. Our NOWJOBS platform, which successfully competes in the low-skill, higher volume
segment, is primarily geared to students and other seekers of one-off temporary jobs, and is to date our
most successful digital initiative. Originally just available in Belgium where it launched in 2017, we
launched NOWJOBS in the Netherlands in 2019, in France in 2021 and in Germany in June 2022,
bringing on board big customers such as retail brands H&M and Picnic. For the year ended December
31, 2021, NOWJOBS handled approximately 1.1 billion requests and generated €54.1 million, €1.9
million and €0.2 million in revenues in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, respectively. Following
our acquisition of StaffMe in July 2022, NOWJOBS will operate under the StaffMe brand in France
given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country. In addition, we launched our SWOP
Recruiter application in May 2021, which is a free digital platform that helps Belgian SMEs with the
day-to-day management of their vacancies. The application is linked to our SWOP application, which
we launched in 2016 and further upgraded in 2020, and is now one of the largest Belgian apps to help
job seekers find a new permanent job. We launched SWOP in the Netherlands in October 2022 and plan
to launch SWOP in Germany in the near future. Our Gighouse app is a digital platform that matches
freelancers and independent job candidates with available projects at our customers. We aim to leverage
our experience as a disruptor in the market to expand successful initiatives to our broader Group.

In addition, we have also developed a number of complementary digital offerings that supplement our
core services. For example, in June 2019, we launched our MyAccent app, which allows potential job
candidates to interact via the Google Home assistant with Accent’s list of open positions. Book’u is our
planning tool, allowing customers to plan both their permanent and temporary workforce in one
solution, being in touch with this workforce to communicate when they should be available and
allowing to spot potential staffing shortages, immediately posting these shortages at their staffing
companies of choice. My Talents (Softskillz) testing has been developed together with the University
of Ghent, to test ‘who you are’ as a person and to test ‘what type of company do I want to work for.’
These tests will allow for better AI matching of jobs with candidates. Continu-Connect, which launched
in 2021 and had 756 registered contacts as of December 31, 2021, shows all available candidates in a
region for our customers. Our FYGI app brings together freelance HR recruiters with companies that
have a recruitment request. We have also other apps and platforms that assist with the recruitment and
other staffing processes, such as Dora, Ariad and CV Creator. All apps are developed taking into
account reusability across all House of HR operating companies, benefitting therefore from the
economies of scale House of HR has versus local competitors and increasing the barriers to entry for
our industry.

During 2021, we centralized all our digital assets in House of Invest, creating one platform to meet
current needs and invest in new needs as they arise. This enabled us to further invest in our digital
roadmap and internationalize our digital initiatives, bringing our digital and IT talents together to work
on multiple digital solutions. The main purpose of House of Invest is to roll out the digital initiatives
across all House of HR Powerhouses and Boutiques and to capitalize on a centralized knowledge base.
House of Invest now owns NOWJOBS, Gighouse, SWOP and SWOP Recruiter, Continu-Connect, CV
creator and My Talents (Softskillz), and holds minority ownerships in Dora and Ariad (a traditional
digital marketing staffing company) and a majority ownership in Book’u.


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from digital solutions amounted to 2.6% of total
revenue, compared to 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have continued investing in IT
in 2022 and expect to continue prioritizing the digital venue going forward. We believe our digital
offering protects us from disruptions from digital players who focus on low-skilled, high volume
business, while our platforms continue to focus on high-skilled job candidates with a focus on SMEs.

We are also continuing to innovate our existing processes by identifying areas within our business that
could benefit from increased automation and zero-paper processes, including both job candidate- and
client-facing and internal processes, such as finance, procurement and marketing and communications.
Further, we continue to digitalize our processes and create a centralized repository designed to store,
process and secure large amounts of data across our different applications, which will enhance our
access to job candidates and improve our matching capabilities. We believe the efficiencies we can
realize through this digitalization will produce cost savings while allowing us to meet the everincreasing demands of clients and job candidates.

**_Entrepreneurial and invested management team with long-term incentive culture backed by a new,_**
**_highly supportive shareholder with deep industry knowledge_**

We benefit from a strong and committed management team that is highly motivated to deliver strong
performance over the long term. We believe our successful organic and external growth has been due
in part to the way in which we have been able to incentivize our managers. For example, our organic
“cell division” expansion strategy rewards our local managers with the opportunity to create and run
individual branches, fostering loyalty and encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit that has delivered our
success to date. For our engineering and consulting branches, our variable pay structure rewards
management down to the sales and recruitment consultants with variable pay linked to key performance
indicators such as attracting, matching and retaining job candidates and clients. While keeping a highly
entrepreneurial culture at the Powerhouse and Boutique levels, all strategic decisions with a significant
impact are made at House of HR level, and our local business units share in the centralized corporate
support and institutional knowledge.

We now also benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of
our new shareholder, Bain Capital. Bain Capital has a strong track record of investing in the business
services space with over 50 current or past investments. Bain Capital has invested in businesses in the
staffing and engineering consulting services, including Quest, a leading global engineering services
provider, MSX International, a BPO company focused on technical staffing solutions and managed
services, Inetum, an IT services provider in France, and Engineering, an IT systems and services
provider in Italy, as well as other investments in the business services space, including Autodistribution
and Bravida. Following the Acquisition, our management continues to remain invested in the equity of
the Group, having reinvested approximately 63% of the net proceeds received from the Acquisition in
the Group, totaling approximately €255.0 million, or between 20% to 25% of ownership of the Group.

**Our Strategies**

We and the Sponsor have developed the following strategies:

**_Make use of our agile, decentralized operating model to further focus on organic growth by grasping_**
**_additional market share while maintaining best-in-class profitability_**

Over the years, we have been highly successful in achieving incremental organic revenue growth under
our “cell division” approach in our specialized talents solutions segment as clients are mostly SMEs
who require high touch local services. In most of our markets, we expect to continue our strategy of
embedding ourselves in local communities through an extensive branch network. While our primary
operations are in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, we have branches spread across
countries where we source job candidates. Our international recruiting network is key for our ability to
attract and retain job candidates for assignments in sectors where candidates are scarce. Our
decentralized structure places our Powerhouses and Boutiques in proximity to our primary stakeholders:


-----

our clients, our job candidates and our own employees, which allows us to gain local market knowledge,
understand local competition and remain informed of local staffing trends. In order to continue to grow,
we intend to expand our branch network where needed and to continue to leverage our success in
sourcing and retaining job candidates, focusing on those job profiles which are and will be increasingly
scarce in the market. We also believe our extensive branch network approach leads to enhanced
entrepreneurship and ownership due to the managerial responsibilities and opportunities allocated or
available to branch managers, reinforcing a key part of our values.

We also intend to continue to focus on, and leverage our positive track record in, our engineering and
consulting and specialized talent solutions segments to continue growing profitably. We have gradually
shifted our focus toward the engineering and consulting and specialized staffing model and away from
general staffing, benefiting from our growing network in the transition to deliver higher margins. The
specialized staffing and engineering and consulting segments tend to deliver higher margins than
general staffing due to the premium clients place on successful placement of the specific job candidates
that they seek. Specialization in turn aims to target those segments and skills that are more difficult to
find for our customers, which in the past has provided more stability to our revenue figures and
protected our margins, including during economic downturns. We further aim to deliver continued
improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin through efficient cost control over operating expense and
strong cash conversion with rigorous management of capital expenditures and working capital.

We believe our agile organization and increased specialization will continue to promote flexibility for
our Powerhouses and Boutiques to refine recruitment approaches and conduct day-to-day activities that
best meet their respective local business needs and enable us to offer clients tailored staffing services.
We believe this will continue to translate into higher market penetration and additional market share to
propel our organic growth, as well as our ability to effectively staff specialized jobs that drive our bestin-class profitability given the scarcity and complexity of the job profiles we match.

**_Enhance our reputation as the partner of choice for SMEs and locally managed clients_**

We intend to continue providing critical end-to-end temporary recruiting and outsourcing services that
are tailored to the needs of SMEs and other locally-managed clients. We believe that in the future these
clients, in both our engineering and consulting segment and specialized talent solutions segment, will
continue to require the assistance of providers like us primarily for temporary HR solutions as they
grapple with limited resources, lower visibility on staffing needs and greater need for outsourced HR
functions, including as a result of the complexity of labor law and associated regulations. As the partner
of choice for our SMEs and locally managed clients, we are experienced in accommodating unique and
time-sensitive client demands, including matching specialized, “mission-critical” profiles for our clients
in the engineering and consulting segment that typically last for months, or deploying a large number
of blue-collar workers at short notice for our clients in the specialized talent solutions segment that often
last for weeks or sometimes just hours as the situations require. We plan to continue focusing on being
the partner of choice for SMEs and locally managed clients by leveraging the large pool of potential
job candidates at our disposal and the deep end-market knowledge we have gathered over the years by
having boots on the ground in proximity to our clients.

**_Ensure the smooth and profitable placement of job candidates with a reliable sourcing and reskilling_**
**_platform_**

Mastering the “human” aspect of human resources is key to success in our industry, and we intend to
continue to be a leader through our focus on being able to source the right job candidate for the right
position, including through offering reskilling services. We believe that our network of international
sourcing of job candidates is vital to our success, as we are better able to bridge the large gap between
the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates, especially as the labor market
in our Addressable Market has tightened over the past few years, through having access to a wider pool
of quality job candidates than our peers. The location of our agencies (particularly in Poland, Romania,
Spain, the Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal) and the support we offer to foreign job candidates


-----

(including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance) ensures
that we are able to tap into workforces that are skilled but that are eager to seek out opportunities to
earn higher wages than those that similar work would provide in their home countries. We intend to
continue to develop our network in other countries that meet these criteria. We also plan to continue
leveraging our large sourcing network to target the best job candidates and provide them with a wide
array of positions and support, including in-house training that equips them with skillsets that match
the profiles that our clients look for, administrative support, client knowledge and even transport and
housing for foreign job candidates to make their experience as smooth as possible. Finally, we plan to
focus on preparing job candidates for what we see as the jobs of tomorrow, such as white-collar
positions in big data and information technology, that are being driven by the digitalization of the
economy or provide training in order to teach blue-collar job candidates how to use digital tools.

**_Utilize digital initiatives to reduce cost and drive revenue diversification_**

Our digital strategy is focused on maximizing the impact of digital cost reduction initiatives, outpacing
smaller competitors who have more limited investment capabilities and opening new market segments.
In the near-term, we want to leverage digital tools to complement our physical networks to attract job
candidates and clients while also spreading awareness of our brands and services. We also intend to
continue digitalizing our processes to drive efficiency. For example, SWOP, our free digital sourcing
platform that assists SMEs with day-to-day management of their vacancies, strengthens our sourcing
capability and supplements the activities of our revenue-generating business units, such as NOWJOBS,
which facilitates the actual matching of job candidates with clients.

Over the longer term, we intend to pursue a four-pillared digital strategy. First, we aim to reposition the
offices we have in urban areas into “JobShops” that are easy to reach, convenient, one-stop shops where
job candidates can be tested, get certifications and be matched with potential positions through our
digital platforms that require limited involvement of our recruiting consultants. We also are continuing
to develop niche, specialized digital platforms that are tailored to meet the specific demands of the
various markets we address. Furthermore, we intend to utilize the data that we have generated through
our large network to deliver the best possible client and job candidate service through our candidate
data platform. For example, we are currently developing Mission Akira, a data-driven tool that helps to
train our consultants on the kind of information that they should ask candidates for in order to better
prepare them for placement. We are also developing a client version of the ‘Who do I want to work for’
test, which indicates the type of job candidates that fit best with a particular team leader, and the ‘My
brains’ test which attempts to indicate the intelligence level of a job candidate within their education
level. We also plan to develop more automated processes to free up our recruiting consultants’ time for
them to focus on growing ever closer to our client and job candidate base and gather the right
information that will lead to faster and better matching.

As part of our digital strategy, we are in the process of rolling out our digital platforms internationally
to enable us to get more structured and accurate information from job candidates, so we can match them
with the right clients in a more effective and flexible manner, which we believe will help introduce
brand loyalty and help us with client and job candidates retention. For example, NOWJOBS was first
launched in Belgium in 2017, and it was subsequently launched in the Netherlands in 2019, in France
in 2021 and most recently in Germany in 2022. We also acquired StaffMe in July 2022, a French digital
platform focusing on student employment and which is primarily active in the retail, health event and
hospitality sectors, supplementing our NOWJOBS offering. Through this acquisition, we also acquired
the other companies of the StaffMe group, including the StaffMe Academy, the first training
organization for young entrepreneurs, and the Accelerator, a program of integration through selfemployment for those who are far from employment. NOWJOBS will operate under the StaffMe brand
in France given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country. We plan to continue to
develop our other digital platforms and roll them out beyond their current markets.

**_Continue to target accretive acquisition opportunities to achieve European leadership_**


-----

While our primary focus is to grow our earnings base organically and to improve both profitability and
Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow generation through our existing network and customer base, we will continue
to consider accretive and strategic platform and bolt-on acquisitions in both new and existing markets
to achieve our goal of European leadership. We do not consider acquisition opportunities aimed at
turning around a business, but only will consider opportunities that can reinforce our market positions
or expand our footprint, either in new geographical regions or niche areas in which we currently are not
present and that exhibit the following attributes: stable economies with low unemployment, high salary
level, high temporary staff penetration, a stable regulatory environment and supply and demand
mismatch for skilled labor. We will continue to focus on acquisitions of highly specialized businesses
(such as IT, legal and finance), business focusing on bottleneck jobs and engineering and consulting
services. We will also consider opportunities in digital tools that can improve the value chain or allow
us to better serve job candidates as well as clients and to develop new and complementary segments
that are also marked by labor market scarcity or that can demonstrate the prospect for high growth and
superior margins. We will continue to use our M&A assessment criteria, which requires that any
opportunity meets our own high quality standards, holds a leading position in its respective specialized
end-market, reflects a strong financial profile and represents a good cultural fit with us. While we
historically have focused on bolt-on acquisitions that can enhance our network and/or provide us with
exposure to complementary sectors of the economy, we also occasionally consider larger acquisitions
that are otherwise consistent with our investment criteria. We are also targeting, in particular, certain
new end-markets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals and new geographic markets such as the
Nordic countries and other countries, such as Austria and Switzerland.

On May 28, 2022, the Issuer entered into a share purchase agreement (as amended on November 2,
2022, the “Acquisition Agreement”), by and among, inter alios, the Issuer and the sellers named therein
(the “Sellers”) relating to the transfer by the Sellers and the acquisition by the Issuer, directly and/or
indirectly, of all of the issued and outstanding share capital of House of HR. The Acquisition was
consummated on November 3, 2022 (the “Acquisition Closing Date”).

The purchase price for the Acquisition, including the repayment of the Existing Notes and the Existing
Facilities, was €2,676.7 million (the “Purchase Price”). In addition, the Acquisition Agreement contains
certain agreed earn-outs which may subsequently become payable to the Sellers in the event that certain
conditions are met in the future, including an earn-out of up to €110.0 million depending on the level
of the Group’s EBITDA for the fiscal years 2022 and 2023.

Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, on the Acquisition Closing Date, Naxicap Partners,
Ms. Vandendriessche, House of HR’s co-founder, and certain reinvesting managers and other minority
shareholders reinvested a certain portion of their Acquisition proceeds (or rolled over all or part of the
shares they held, directly or indirectly, in House of HR), through either (i) contributions in cash, (ii)
roll-up contributions of part of the receivables they would come to hold against the purchaser (or any
of its affiliates) in the context of the Acquisition (in respect of the purchase price due to them) or (iii)
contributions in kind of their respective shares in House of HR or the Dutch management vehicle in
exchange for ordinary shares and fixed-return preferred shares issued by Villa Dutch Holdco B.V.
(“Holdco”), an indirect parent of the Issuer. See “—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure”
below. The contributions (in cash or in kind) referred to in this paragraph are collectively referred herein
as the “Shareholders’ Reinvestment.”

Although the Sellers have given certain customary representations, warranties and indemnities as to,
_inter alia, capacity, title and certain business matters in the Acquisition Agreement, the Issuer may not_
be able to enforce claims against the Sellers relating to breaches of these representations, warranties
and indemnities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not be able to enforce
_claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties that the Sellers have provided to the_
_Issuer under the Acquisition Agreement.”_

**_Sources and Uses for the Acquisition and other Transactions_**

Existing Facilities and certain other debt, and the payment of related fees and expenses and other costs
related to the Transactions consisted of proceeds from the following sources:

ordinary shares and fixed-return preferred shares issued by Holdco (the “Pari passu Shares”)
equaling approximately €596.8 million and contributed to the Issuer through intermediate
holding companies (the “Shareholder Equity Contribution”); and (ii) the Shareholders’

Vijverberg, Sira Consulting, Ambulance Zorg+, Bis People, StaffMe, LD Personalvermittlung, and FID
Service Groep (which have been included in the September 30, 2022 consolidation perimeter), we
completed the acquisition of Agium and Job Raccoon and signed a share purchase agreement to acquire
ABMI, each as described in further detail below. The total enterprise value of the 15 closed acquisitions
in 2022 is approximately €379 million, and their expected contribution to EBITDA is approximately
€50 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, based on our due diligence in respect of
these targets. In addition, the total enterprise value of the ABMI acquisition is approximately €60


-----

million and the expected additional EBITDA contribution from this target is approximately €8.2 million
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, based on our due diligence in respect of these targets.

In addition, if certain conditions are met, up to approximately €10.5 million of additional consideration
in the form of earn-outs could become payable in connection with the acquisitions of StaffMe, LD
Personalvermittlung and Job Raccoon, and up to approximately €10.0 million in connection with the
ABMI acquisition. In addition, under ABMI’s Put Option Agreement (as defined below) we may be
required to make certain payments up to an amount of approximately €5.8 million if certain events
occur, such as if we receive certain credits from the French authorities.

We funded the acquisition of Agium and Job Raccoon with cash on balance sheet, and intend to fund
the acquisition of ABMI with cash on balance sheet and cash resulting from capital increases.

For more information see “Risk Factors—Risks relating to Our Business and Industry—We have
_included certain historical financial information on entities that we acquired, which were not prepared_
_by us or reviewed by our auditors and in some instances, which were not audited at all, or which were_
_prepared on a different basis from our current IFRS financial statements, which may not be reflective_
_of our past performance or representative of our future results” and “Risk Factors—Risks relating to_
_Our Business and Industry—We may not realize the expected benefit of our past or future acquisitions_
_or we may face unforeseen costs or liabilities.”_

_Acquisitions Completed after September 30, 2022_

On October 7, 2022, we acquired Agium, a Dutch company specialized in deploying skilled
professionals to support companies in their day-to-day finance and control processes and
implementation of structure changes. Agium is expected to operate under our Redmore Powerhouse.
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Agium generated revenue and EBITDA of €20.3
million and €2.9 million, respectively, and has an enterprise value of €19.5 million, based on our due
diligence in respect of the target.

On November 14, 2022, we acquired Job Raccoon in an asset deal to supplement our TIMEPARTNER
Powerhouse. Job Raccoon is a German recruitment agency using an internet-based recruitment platform
specializing in the recruitment of blue-collar workers. At completion, there was an upfront payment for
this acquisition in an amount of €0.3 million. In addition, the purchase agreement includes an earn-out
in an amount not to exceed €0.5 million in total, which may become payable if certain condition
precedents are reached.

_Future Acquisitions_

On October 25, 2022, House of HR NV and the shareholders of ABMI signed a put option agreement
(the “Put Option Agreement”) to which a fully negotiated memorandum of understanding is attached,
to acquire the French company ABMI, a consulting and engineering services group operating mainly
in three engineering segments: (i) product design and industrialization, (ii) industrial processes and (iii)
industrial facilities (e.g., nuclear and railway infrastructures). The put option may be exercised by the
sellers upon completion of the information and consultation of the relevant employee representative
bodies to which the offer has been submitted and we are awaiting for written confirmation of approval.
The acquisition is expected to be completed in December 2022, subject to the put option being exercised
by the sellers, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Following the acquisition of
ABMI, we expect to combine ABMI with Abylsen in order to create a new Powerhouse, ABY
Engineering. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, ABMI generated revenue and EBITDA
of approximately €57.0 million and approximately €8.2 million, respectively, and has an enterprise
value of approximately €60.0 million, based on our due diligence in respect of the target.

We also have a number of other potential targets in our pipeline for the remainder of 2022 and 2023.

**_Trading Update_**

Our Like-for-Like Revenue based on the business unit accounts for the month ended October 31, 2022
increased by 13.7% to €255.3 million from €224.5 million for the month ended October 31, 2021. Our
Like-for-Like EBITDA for the month ended October 31, 2022 was €30.0 million, representing an
increase of 6.4% from €28.2 million for the same period in 2021. Our Like-for-Like Revenue increased
by 16.9% to €2,352.0 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2022, and our Like-for-Like
EBITDA increased by 11.7% to €275.0 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2022. The increase
in our Like-for-Like EBITDA and Like-for-Like Revenue was primarily due to labor scarcity and
demand-supply dynamics in the labor market. Our Like-for-Like EBITDA margin decreased to 11.8%
in October 2022 from 12.6% in October 2021, primarily due to investments in people and sales and
marketing actions to increase inflow.

senior secured basis, as described below
under “—Note Guarantees”;

                                      - be effectively subordinated to any
existing and future indebtedness or
obligation of the Issuer or of its
subsidiaries that are secured by property
or assets that do not constitute Collateral,
to the extent of the value of the property
or assets securing such obligation or
indebtedness; and

                                      - be structurally subordinated to any
existing or future indebtedness of

obligations to trade creditors) that do not
guarantee the Notes, including French
Bidco.

**Note Guarantees ....................................** The Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a
senior basis by (i) on the Issue Date, the Original

subject to and in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles and to certain material
limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the PostClosing Guarantors.

As of and for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022, the expected Post-Closing
Guarantors represented 63.8% of Like-for-Like
Revenues of House of HR, 38.0% of the
consolidated assets (excluding intercompany
eliminations) of House of HR and 89.1% of Likefor-Like EBITDA of House of HR.

Each Note Guarantee will be subject to the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement and certain
contractual and legal limitations. See
“Description _of_ _Other_ _Indebtedness—_
_Intercreditor_ _Agreement”_ _and_ _“Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations_
_on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.” By virtue_
of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation
under its Note Guarantee could be significantly
less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our_


-----

_Structure—Corporate_ _benefit,_ _financial_
_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other_
_limitations on the Note Guarantees and the_
_Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the_
_Collateral.” In addition, the Note Guarantees_
_may be released under certain circumstances._
_See “Description of the Notes—Brief Description_
_of the Notes and the Note Guarantees” and_
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of_

**Ranking of the Note Guarantees .............** Each Note Guarantee will:

                                      - rank pari passu in right of payment with
all of such Guarantor’s existing and
future debt that is not subordinated in
right of payment to its Note Guarantee,
including such Guarantor’s obligations
under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the Bridge Facility;

                                      - rank senior in right of payment to all of

Note Guarantee;

                                      - rank effectively senior to any existing
and future unsecured debt of such
Guarantor, to the extent of the value of
the Collateral that is available to satisfy
the obligations under the Note
Guarantees;

                                      - rank effectively senior to any existing
and future debt of such Guarantor
secured on a second-ranking basis by
property or assets that secure the Note
Guarantee on a first-ranking basis;

                                      - be effectively subordinated to any
existing and future debt of that Guarantor
(including obligations to trade creditors)
that is secured by property or assets that
do not constitute Collateral, to the extent
of the value of the property and assets
securing such obligations or
indebtedness; and


-----

                                      - be structurally subordinated to any
existing and future debt of such
Guarantor’s subsidiaries (including
obligations to trade creditors) that do not
guarantee the Notes.

**Collateral ..............................................** Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles and subject to certain material
limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a
first-ranking basis:

                                      - on the Issue Date, by:

(a) a Dutch law governed limited recourse share

pledge over the shares in the Issuer owned by
Midco;

(b) a Dutch law governed limited recourse

security interest agreement over structural
intercompany receivables owed by the Issuer
to Midco;

(c) a Dutch law governed share pledge over the
shares in the Original Guarantor owned by
the Issuer;

(d) a Dutch law governed security interest

agreement over material, long-term,
documented, structural intercompany
receivables owed by the Original Guarantor
to the Issuer;

(e) a Dutch law governed bank account pledge
over the Issuer’s material bank accounts in
the Netherlands;

(f) a French law governed pledge over shares in
French Bidco owned by the Issuer;

(g) a Belgian law governed share pledge over the
shares in House of HR owned by the Issuer;
and

(h) a Dutch law governed security interest
agreement over structural intercompany
receivables owed by House of HR to the
Original Guarantor ((a) through (h) together,
the “Issue Date Collateral”);

                                      - on or prior to March 3, 2023, by:

(a) share pledges granted by wholly owned
Material Subsidiaries incorporated in a
Guarantor Jurisdiction over the shares
held in each Material Subsidiary


-----

incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction;
and

(b) in respect of a Post-Closing Guarantor (if
any) (i) incorporated in England and
Wales, floating security over
substantially all assets located in its
jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to
customary “excluded assets,” including
real estate, and other customary
exclusions, materiality thresholds and
exceptions); and (ii) incorporated in the
United States, security over substantially
all assets located in its jurisdiction of
incorporation (subject to customary
“excluded asset,” including real estate,
and other customary exclusions,
materiality thresholds and exceptions),
in each case, where to do so would not
have a material adverse effect on their
ability to conduct their business and
operations, as determined by each such
Post-Closing Guarantor in its sole and
absolute discretion ((a) and (b) together,
the “Post-Closing Collateral,” and
together with the Issue Date Collateral,
the “Collateral”).

Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles, the Collateral will also
secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the Bridge Facility on a first-priority basis and
the Second Lien Facility on a second-priority
basis. The security interests may be limited by
applicable law or subject to certain defenses that
may limit their validity and enforceability. In
addition, the security interests in the Collateral
may be released under certain circumstances.
Subject to the provisions of Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be
pledged to secure future indebtedness. For more
information on the security interests granted, see
“Description of the Notes—Security” and for
more information on potential limitations to the
security interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Notes and Our Structure.”_

**Use of Proceeds ......................................** The proceeds from the Offering of the Notes will
be used to partially repay amounts drawn under
the Bridge Facility, including accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, and to pay the costs, fees and


-----

expenses incurred in connection with the
Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Additional Amounts ...............................** Any payments made by the Issuer or any
Guarantor with respect to the Notes or Note
Guarantees will be made without withholding or
deduction for taxes unless required by law. If
such withholding or deduction is required by law
in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined
in “Description of the Notes—Withholding
_Taxes”), the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as_
applicable, will pay the additional amounts
necessary so that the net amounts received by the
Holder (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Definitions”) of the Notes after the_
withholding or deduction is not less than the
amount that would have been received in the
absence of the withholding or deduction, subject
to certain exceptions. See “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

**Optional Redemption .............................** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes on
or after         , 2025, at the redemption prices
set forth under “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid_
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of redemption.

Prior to        , 2025, the Issuer may on any
one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued
under the Indenture (including any additional
Notes), using the net cash proceeds from certain
equity offerings at a redemption price equal
to        % of the principal amount of Notes so
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
date of redemption; provided that at least 50% of
the original principal amount of Notes originally
issued under the Indenture (excluding any
additional Notes) remains outstanding after each
such redemption.

Prior to       , 2025, the Issuer may redeem
up to 10% of the original principal amount of
Notes (including any additional Notes of the
same series) in each calendar year, commencing
on the Issue Date, at a redemption price equal to
103% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, up to, but excluding, the
redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption.”_


-----

In addition, prior to       , 2025, the Issuer
may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the
Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes plus the “makewhole” premium described in this Offering
Memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the date of redemption.

**Optional Redemption for tax reasons ......** In the event of certain changes in law affecting
taxation, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in
whole, but not in part, at any time, upon giving
notice, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to,
but excluding, the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control .................................** Upon the occurrence of certain change of control
triggering events, the Issuer will be required to
offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to,
but excluding, the date of the purchase. A change
of control triggering event, however, will not be
deemed to have occurred if a specified
consolidated total net leverage ratio is not
exceeded in connection with such event. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**Certain Tender Offers............................** In connection with certain tender offers for the
Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable
series of outstanding Notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and
the Issuer, or any third party making such a
tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of
the applicable series of Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or
such third party will have the right to redeem the
Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not
in part, following such purchase at a price equal
to the price offered to each other holder of Notes.
See “Description _of the Notes—Optional_
_Redemption.”_

**Certain Covenants .................................** The Indenture will limit, among other things, the
ability of the Issuer and (as applicable) its
subsidiaries to:


-----

                                      - incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness and issue certain preferred
stock;

                                      - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase
our capital stock;

                                      - make certain restricted payments;

                                      - make certain investments;

                                      - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                                      - impose restrictions on the ability of their
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make
other payments to the Issuer;

                                      - merge or consolidate with other entities,
or make certain asset sales;

                                      - enter into certain transactions with
affiliates; and

                                      - impair the security interests for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be
subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants.” Certain of the covenants_
and events of default will be suspended if and for
as long as, and the security interests in respect of
the Collateral will be released if, we achieve
investment grade ratings. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain_ _Covenants—Suspension_ _of_
_Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade_
_Status.”_

**U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations .** For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income
tax considerations of an investment in the Notes,
see “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” You_

the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax
consequences of an investment in the Notes.

**Original Issue Discount ..........................** The Notes may be issued with original issue
discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In such event, holders subject to U.S.
federal income tax generally will be required to
include such OID in gross income (as ordinary
income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to
maturity basis) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in advance of the receipt of cash
payments to which such OID is attributable and


-----

regardless of the holder’s regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
See “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—_
_Original Issue Discount.”_

**Transfer Restrictions .............................** The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not
been registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction and will
not be so registered. The Notes are subject to
restrictions on transferability and resale. See
“Transfer Restrictions.” Holders of the Notes
will not have the benefit of any exchange or
registration rights.

**No Prior Market ....................................** The Notes will be new securities for which there
is no market. Although the Initial Purchasers
have informed us that they intend to make a
market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do
so, and they may discontinue market making at
any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that an active trading market for the
Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Listing...................................................** Application will be made to list the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange. There can be no
assurance, however, that the Notes will be listed
on the Official List of the Exchange, that such
admission to trading in the Notes will be granted
or that such listing will be maintained. The
Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to
the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU on
markets in financial instruments, as amended.

_The financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 presented below was derived by adding_
_House of HR’s consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021 to its consolidated_

_information for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The summary unaudited consolidated financial_

_future date or for any future period. The as adjusted financial information of the Issuer as of and for the twelve_

**Summary Consolidated Other Financial and Pro Forma Information**

**_Organic Growth, Like-for-Like and Pro Forma Historical Information of the Company_**

We present Organic Growth in order to demonstrate our period-on-period revenue growth on an organic
basis excluding the impact of acquisitions between one financial period and the comparable prior period
by assuming no acquisitions have occurred after the start-date of the prior comparative period as noted
in the footnotes below. We present Like-for-Like Revenue and Like-for-Like EBITDA in order to
demonstrate our revenue and EBITDA growth over a number of periods by adjusting each period to
reflect all of the acquisitions that have occurred as of a particular date as though such acquisitions had
occurred on the first date of the earliest comparative period. Like-for-Like Revenue and Like-for-Like
EBITDA presented in the below tables are adjusted to reflect our consolidated perimeter including all
the acquisitions that had occurred as of September 30, 2022, as if such perimeter had been in place from
January 1, 2019. We also present Like-for-Like figures using different acquisition perimeters elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” for further
information. _Pro Forma_ Management Adjusted Revenue and _Pro Forma Management Adjusted_
EBITDA are adjusted to reflect the impact of acquisitions that occurred during that period as if they
had occurred on the first date of such period as described in footnotes 10 and 12(e) below. As a result,
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Like-for-Like Revenue and Like-for-Like EBITDA
based on our consolidated perimeter as of September 30, 2022 are, respectively, the same figures as Pro
_Forma Management Adjusted Revenue and Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA._

and “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key factors affecting our results
_of operations—Drivers of sales and pricing—Organic Growth.” The differences between the sum of the segments and the totals_
presented in the table are due to intragroup eliminations and due to revenue from the corporate segment.

(2) In respect of revenue for 2020 (compared to 2019), we have assumed that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019 and
that the divestment of GRITT Projects had taken place as of January 1, 2019.

for the specialized talent solutions segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 represent the sum of the
results of the legacy specialized staffing and general staffing segments. As a result, such information may not be directly
comparable with the information included in our 2020 Financial Statements. See “ Presentation of Financial and Other

(6) We present Like-for-Like Revenue and Like-for-Like EBITDA because we believe it enhances the comparability of our results of
operations from period to period by using the same consolidation perimeter. Like-for-Like Revenue and Like-for-Like EBITDA
are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as substitutes to other indicators of our
operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. See “ Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information” and “ Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We have included certain_
_historical financial information on entities that we acquired, which were not prepared by us or reviewed by our auditors and in_
_some instances, which were not audited at all, or which were prepared on a different basis from our current IFRS financial_
_statements, which may not be reflective of our past performance or representative of our future results.”_

(7) Like-for-Like Revenue represents revenue adjusted to reflect our consolidation perimeter as of September 30, 2022, as if such
perimeter had been in place since January 1, 2019. See “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Acquisitions, Disposals and the Comparability_
_of our Financial Statements” for a description of acquisitions that have impacted our consolidation period since January 1, 2019._

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained_
_in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before_
_purchasing the Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Group_
_faces. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently believe are_
_immaterial could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial_
_condition, cash flows, competitive position and prospects. If any of the possible events described below_
_occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, competitive position and_
_prospects could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the Issuer may not be able to pay_
_interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic_**
**_conditions._**

Demand for our staffing services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity and economic
conditions in the countries, regions and sectors in which we operate. A global economic downturn, such
as the one resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, which impacts a country or region in which we
operate may adversely affect our staffing services in that country or region, as fewer clients may seek
our job candidates for assignments. In addition, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022,
global supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical conflicts have caused an immediate impact on
global economic conditions, which has led to increased inflationary pressure in 2022, including causing
increases in the price for goods and services, which has resulted and may continue to result in shortages
in materials and services. Such shortages have resulted and may continue to result in inflationary cost
increases for labor, fuel, materials and services, and could continue to cause costs to increase. Although
we do not have direct economic activities in Russia and Ukraine and currently the conflict has not had
any material impact on our overall sales and EBITDA, it is difficult to predict the scope and extent of
any potential impact of the increasing tensions and other geopolitical conflicts could have on our
operations, especially given we source candidates from Eastern Europe. Moreover, gas and other raw
materials in relation to supply shortages are significantly impacting many industries and sectors, which
could result in our clients reconsidering their recruitment efforts of domestic and foreign talents, which
may, in turn, impact our results of operations. Furthermore, continuing increases in inflation could
impact the overall demand for and costs of our services and the margins we are able to realize on our
services, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. Inflation may also result in higher interest rates, which in turn would result
in higher interests we incur on our borrowings. While the global economy has recovered from the impact
of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, there remains considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of
the above factors and the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies which had been adopted by the
central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies in the past decade. We
cannot predict the long-term effects such factors may have on the global political and economic
conditions, including whether they may result in a severe or prolonged global economic recession.

Moreover, our revenue and results of operations are dependent on a limited number of countries in
Europe and we have material operations in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France. For the
year ended December 31, 2021, these countries accounted for 27.8%, 41.9%, 22.2% and 8.1%,
respectively, of our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue and as a result, we are particularly_
exposed to risks arising from economic conditions in these countries. For example, as the United
Kingdom (“U.K.”) represents a key export market for several of the countries in which we operate,


-----

particularly Belgium and the Netherlands, adverse trade terms between the U.K. and the countries in
which we operate following the entry into force of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on
May 1, 2021 could have an adverse effect on the economies of these countries, which could by extension
adversely affect demand for our services or our business. Moreover, there is a possibility that other
Member States, including the countries where we source our job candidates, could also withdraw from
the EU. If this materializes, it could pose further uncertainties on the application of laws and the
economies within the EU and the countries involved, including limitation on the free movement of
people, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, a downturn in the endmarkets in which we target clients could have a negative impact on the demand for our services or the
prices clients are willing to pay for our services. Moreover, an economic downturn may impact us
differently than it has in the past. Among our two business segments, specialized talent solutions has
historically been more sensitive to economic fluctuations due to the temporary and flexible staffing
element in this segment, which has led to decreases in demand for such services in connection with
economic downturns, including that experienced in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic, even if it
has historically recovered faster compared to the engineering and consulting segment.

Actions that we take to decrease our expenses during an economic downturn may not prevent a loss in
operating profit and could have a longer term impact on our operations. When demand drops or remains
low, we attempt to reduce the amount of our sales and marketing expenses and job candidates in order
to reduce our cost of services and operating expenses but such reductions may not occur as quickly as,
or be sufficient to offset the decrease in our revenue. If periods of decline are prolonged and result in a
significant decrease in the size of our in-house employees or job candidates, we may not be able to
reduce our expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our business units,
branches and brands. Furthermore, our decentralized structure can lead to increased costs, which in
times of economic downturn could lead to decreased profitability.

Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_The Covid-19 pandemic, including the resulting global economic uncertainty and the related_**
**_lockdown measures, in particular its effects in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France_**
**_where we have material operations, or other epidemics or pandemics, have had in the past, and could_**
**_have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand for our staffing services, our revenue,_**
**_operations and workforce._**

The Covid-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variants such as Delta and Omicron and related
sub-variants, and the rapidly evolving reactions of authorities, including those in Belgium, the
Netherlands, Germany and France, to contain the spread and address the impact of Covid-19 have had
significant direct and indirect effects on businesses and commerce generally, including disruptions to
supply chain, workforce, transactional activity, facility operation and production. While restrictions on
the conduct of business in many jurisdictions, including the closure of workplaces determined to be
non-essential, have eased or been lifted, there remain certain restrictions on the international, national
and local movement of people and goods, which continue to disrupt many of our clients’ business
operations and their recruitment needs. The extent and scope of such restrictions continue to be highly
uncertain and subject to change, and stricter measures could potentially be put in place in the future. A
prolonged continuance of this public health crisis could therefore have a material adverse effect,
including materially increased volatility in financial markets and significant worsening of the global,
European, Belgian, Dutch, German and French macroeconomic outlooks.

The spread of Covid-19 has led us to modify certain of our operational practices, and we may take
further actions required by authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our in-house
employees, job candidates and other stakeholders. We implemented a work-from-home policy that has
been used by most of our in-house employees. For the Group’s in-house employees who cannot work
remotely, we have implemented additional protective procedures, including equipping employees with


-----

sanitizing equipment (such as disinfectants and hand sanitizers), implementing social distancing,
staggering employees working hours as required to comply with governmental restrictions, and
increasing the frequency of cleaning in the Group’s facilities, but these measures may not prevent the
exposure of our in-house employees to Covid-19. For job candidates on assignment with a client, many
of the markets in which we operate still place certain responsibilities on us for overseeing certain health
and safety obligations for our job candidates. See “Regulation.” As a result, for certain job candidates
who have been placed in client workplaces where exposure to Covid-19 is possible, we may be subject
to risk of liability should such employees allege their workplaces failed to adequately mitigate the risk
of exposure to Covid-19. Since we also place job candidates and certain employees with our clients, it
is also possible that one of our job candidates or employees with Covid-19 could then infect other
employees at the clients’ premises, which could lead to sickness, shutdowns or late deliveries at a
client’s business. Clients may hold us liable should we not have taken the required precautionary
measures with such job candidates or employees and it could also cause reputational harm to us should
any such events occur. In addition, in order to facilitate remote working arrangements, some of our job
candidates are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems,
which could increase cybersecurity risks to our clients for which they may hold us liable. The
intersection of public health, workplace safety, employer liability and privacy laws is complex, and we
cannot predict how regulatory or liability regimes may evolve in the future as a result of the Covid-19
pandemic.

Although we have seen a full recovery of our financial performance in 2021 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, we cannot predict the impact that any future developments relating to the Covid19 pandemic may have on the demand for our staffing services and on our business, results of operations
and financial position. These developments may include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread
of Covid-19, its severity, emergence of new variants and further actions taken to contain the virus or
treat its impact, including the rate of deployment of vaccines. A number of measures taken by
governments in the early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic intended to mitigate the spread of Covid-19
caused dramatic disruptions to our clients businesses and impacted the demands for our staffing services
in 2020, in particular in the non-food retail, hotel, restaurant and cafe, aerospace, travel and tourism and
automobile industries. Future waves of Covid-19 may result in national or local governments reviving
such severe countermeasures. For example, in the spring of 2020 different degrees of lockdowns were
introduced in each of our primary geographic markets which had an immediate impact on demand for
our staffing services. Softer lockdowns were introduced again in the autumn of 2020 which also led to
a decrease in job candidates at work after we had experienced a gradual increase in the number of job
candidates at work following the initial lockdown in the spring of 2020. Governmental countermeasures
eased again in early 2021, which led to the gradual normalization of economic activities in our primary
geographic markets, recovering to pre-Covid-19 levels. This trend was carried into 2022 despite the
outbreak of the new strain of Covid-19, Omicron, in the last weeks of 2021 and at the beginning of
2022. Governments could, however, impose similar or more stringent restrictions again in the future as
they deem necessary, and this could lead to economic distress and reduced demand for our staffing
services, which could affect our results of operations. Potential future lockdown measures, such as
shutting down production facilities and offices or restricting free movement of transportation and
distribution, closing of restaurant and bar facilities, closing or reducing hospitality at events, amongst
others, could disrupt our client’s businesses or ours more significantly in the future than what has been
experienced to date, leading them to curtail their reliance on us.

Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, there were a number of government measures introduced,
including in our primary markets of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, which positively
contributed to the Group’s ability to manage cash flows during the period and manage the costs
associated with our in-house employees and job candidates. For example, we utilized temporary
unemployment measures introduced that have allowed us to retain certain in-house employees and job
candidates without bearing the full expense of their wages and salaries and have utilized certain
postponement of VAT or other tax and benefit payments. A number of these measures, however, ended
during the course of 2021, and the remaining measures expired as of July 2022. While this has, to date,
only resulted in a minor impact on our costs, we could experience additional costs and liabilities and


-----

may also find it more difficult to retain in-house employees and job candidates if demand for our staffing
services reduces or is variable due to a resurgence of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate,
without the introduction of additional government measures (or which there is no guarantee any will be
introduced). If any of the foregoing were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects and thus on our ability to fulfill
our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Inflation, changes in regulation and other macroeconomic factors may lead to increase in our_**
**_operating costs that we may not always be able to pass on to our customers, which could adversely_**
**_affect our profitability._**

Certain of our contracts with clients may provide for fixed pricing rates for the services to be provided,
a cap on pricing or other terms which we negotiate based on our assumptions regarding our clients’
required scope of services, costs that will be incurred to fulfill the scope and operational efficiencies we
expect to achieve and other estimates. As a result, while we seek to pass on our costs to our clients, this
may not be feasible in all situations. These assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate,
particularly if operating costs continue to rise in the current inflationary environment, as well as due to
other increases in our costs driven by changes in regulation, increased competition in the labor market,
changes to economic conditions, other costs beyond our control or other developments, and as a result,
our margins under these contracts may be materially adversely affected. In particular, we may be unable
to pass on increases in costs due to a change in regulation governing minimum wage requirements,
payments required to be made under social security and other benefits which could affect our
profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2021, personnel expenses and wage taxes, in aggregate,
constituted 85.1% of our cost of services. Although we seek to structure our arrangements with third
parties on a back-to-back basis with the related customer arrangements, for example, by entering into
agreements with job candidates with durations and termination rights that are coterminous with the
duration of our contracts with the relevant clients, there may be instances where we are not able to offset
or transfer such costs to our clients. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and thus on our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_The employment services sector is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully_**
**_in our markets._**

Our industry is highly competitive. This is driven by a variety of factors, including low barriers to entry
especially in localized markets, the availability of qualified job candidates, the quality and speed of
customer service, and brand loyalty. We compete in a number of our markets with large, consolidated
international staffing services providers and smaller, more localized companies.

Many of our competitors are global full-service and specialized employment services providers with
substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. For
example, our Accent Powerhouse which operates in the specialized talent solutions segment in Belgium,
faces competition from global service providers, each of which compete mainly on volume-driven
clients. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients.

We may also face increased competition from smaller, more localized staffing solutions providers. Such
firms would most likely cater to a smaller set of clients and as a result, may be able to provide more
time and attention to their clients. In particular, SME and ISEs may prefer to work with more localized
firms. Moreover, there is a risk that we may be unable to compete effectively on price with such firms
as their cost base may be lower, including regarding technological capabilities.

In addition, new and existing competitors may be aided by technology that enables them to compete
with our staffing services. The widespread adoption of sophisticated, automated job description and
candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of staffing companies obsolete.
Specifically, the increased use of the internet may continue to attract technology-oriented companies to


-----

the staffing industry. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook and online job boards
such as Google for Jobs are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect
without the assistance of a staffing company. We believe that our future success will depend largely
upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with these and other technological and digital developments
and advances. Current or future competitors could develop alternative capabilities and technologies that
are more effective, efficient, easier to use or more economical than our services. In addition, with
continuing development and increased availability of information technology, the end-markets in which
we compete may attract new competitors. If our capabilities and technologies do not keep up with
advances, become obsolete or uncompetitive, this may lead to increased costs or not being able to find
and match the right job candidates for clients, which may lead to loss of revenues and market share.

We may face competition from our clients themselves as they insource or make alternative
arrangements for some of the services we provide. SMEs and ISEs have historically accounted for a
substantial portion of our sales. As such clients grow, they may increasingly take advantage of low-cost
alternatives, including developing and using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third
party to support them in their staffing needs. Moreover, our clients, particularly our large corporate
clients, may increasingly look for off-shore or near-shore labor markets as alternative sources for
staffing as opposed to our staffing services, and such trend could accelerate as a result of the increase
in remote working as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, there is a risk that we may not be
able to maintain our existing client engagements and if we are not able to maintain or replace such
clients, this could negatively impact our business. Due to competition, we may experience reduced
margins on our services, loss of market share, and loss of clients. Our inability to compete effectively
with current or future competitors as a result of any of the foregoing and other factors could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our
ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified job candidates and_**
**_in-house employees._**

Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified job candidates who possess the skills
and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients, particularly for the specialized
positions that we place under both our engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions
segments. Given the current global labor shortage in our primary markets, we may experience an
increasingly tight labor market with low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be
unable to meet our clients’ requirements in identifying an adequate number of job candidates. We must
continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified job candidates to keep pace with
changing client needs and emerging technologies. Competition for individuals with proven specialty
skills is often intense, and we expect demand for such individuals could make it difficult to retain such
job candidates. Qualified job candidates may not be available to us in sufficient numbers or on terms of
employment acceptable to us. In addition, we may lose existing job candidates to clients, if such clients
decide to permanently retain our job candidates sent on temporary assignment, including as a result of
legislative or regulatory reform. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying
and integrating into their organizations job candidates from diverse backgrounds, and who may
represent different generations, geographical regions and skill sets. These needs may change due to
business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not
be able to identify job candidates with the required attributes, including as a result of expanding
restrictions on immigration or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or
adequate skills to meet the demand where needed. We may also face difficulties in recruiting job
candidates through our international recruitment network if such job candidates are not incentivized to
relocate and seek assignments with clients in the markets in which we operate as a result of increasing
wages in their home countries. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has led many job candidates to reevaluate their careers, work conditions and long-term professional goals, resulting in an increased rate
of employees switching jobs and transitioning between different job modes. While this has led
employers to focus more intensely than ever on employee retention and job mobility, which has created
substantial opportunities for us to offer our services, there is no guarantee that we will be able to


-----

capitalize on this trend. Employers and employees have also grown to be versatile during the Covid-19
pandemic and companies could seek to leverage flexible working arrangements to utilize their current
employees to fill their staffing needs instead of seeking our services.

Further, we are also dependent on our in-house employees to establish and maintain client relationships,
to recruit job candidates, to run our day-to-day operations and to identify internal growth and external
acquisition opportunities. A number of our Powerhouses rely on in-house employees who are specialists
in the end-markets of the clients we serve with a deep understanding of the job requirements of our
clients. Such qualified in-house employees may not continue to be available to us in sufficient numbers
or on terms or in geographic locations which are economically and strategically advantageous to us.
Moreover, we may be unable to continue to find, develop or retain suitable in-house employees who
meet our performance standards.

If we fail to recruit, train or retain qualified job candidates who meet the needs of our clients or in-house
employees who meet our performance standards, our reputation, business and financial results could be
materially adversely affected. Similarly, increases in compensation or in benefits resulting from
competition for such qualified job candidates or in-house employees may have a material adverse effect
on our current business, future prospects, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our
ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Our results of operations or ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot_**
**_successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our_**
**_services and solutions, including that of our digital platform._**

We believe our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the
development and implementation of our services and solutions. For example, rapid changes in the use
of artificial intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve,
and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the staffing industry and for our business.
There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant disruption to our business
model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively.

Additionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support
applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll and client data
analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or
evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to
changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to invest in
or develop particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business.
In particular, we have developed several digital staffing solutions in recent years, and we intend to
continue to invest in our digital initiatives. There is a risk that our digital initiatives will be unsuccessful
as we may be unable to cater these digital solutions to the needs of employers or candidates, develop
the technical aspects of these digital solutions quickly enough to keep pace with market trends or
implement them effectively. Furthermore, we operate on a best practices basis, meaning that we
implement digital initiatives more broadly among our Group once they have been tested by a
Powerhouse, which may lead to delayed implementation of, and as a result, delayed benefit from, such
initiatives. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on the appeal of our services and
solutions, or our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace and, as a
result, on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We rely on certain key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition or results of operations._**

We depend on our senior management at the Group level, as well as key personnel at each operating
company, for the implementation of our business strategy and day-to-day operations. Our senior
management’s and key personnel’s knowledge of the market, our business, our clients and our Group


-----

represents a key strength of our business model, and we believe that our experience and human capital
serve as barriers to entry to potential competitors. Accordingly, we face risks relating to our ability to
continue to attract, retain and incentivize senior management and other key personnel in our company.
If any senior management or key personnel leave, it could take time to find appropriately qualified
individuals to replace them especially considering the specialized nature of our business and the current
tight labor market. If we are unable to retain key members of our senior management team in particular
and cannot hire new qualified personnel in a timely manner, this could negatively impact the
management of our Powerhouses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

**_Maintaining and protecting our reputation and the image of our brands is important to our ability to_**
**_attract and retain clients and job candidates and any harm to our reputation and brands could have_**
**_a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

We rely on our reputation, as well as positive recognition of the brands used by our Powerhouses,
among other factors, to attract and retain clients. We believe that maintaining, protecting and enhancing
our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, useful and innovative
services to our clients and our ability to successfully match job candidates with our clients’ needs. If
clients or job candidates do not perceive our staffing services to be of high quality, our reputation could
be harmed and the value of our brands could diminish, thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our
staffing services to existing and prospective clients as well as job candidates. We also believe that our
reputation and brands may be harmed if we fail to maintain a consistently high level of customer service.
Our reputation and brand could also be negatively affected by the actions of clients or job candidates
that are inappropriate or illegal, regardless of whether such actions relate to services we provide to such
clients or arise while a job candidate is on assignment with a client if we are publicly associated with
such actions. In addition, clients or job candidates may become dissatisfied with our billing policies,
our handling of personal data or other aspects of our staffing services. If we fail to adequately address
these or other complaints, negative publicity about us or our services could diminish confidence in and
the use of our staffing services. Our image or reputation can be severely damaged even by isolated
incidents, particularly if an incident receives considerable negative publicity or results in litigation, and
such litigation may also directly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some
of these incidents may include:

- problematic in-house employee or job candidate behavior, such as social discrimination, violent
behavior and sexual harassment, or disagreements or disputes with clients, job candidates or
in-house employees;

- placing job candidates who do not, or are alleged to not, have the requisite background or
experience;

- accidents that take place both within our own premises or at client sites; or

- breaches or allegations of breaches of legal and regulatory obligations.

Other incidents that may generate negative publicity or harm our reputation or brands may arise from
events that are or may be beyond our control, such as data security breaches or fraudulent activities
associated with our records, work accidents relating to job candidates placed with our clients, litigation
and legal claims or third-party misappropriation, dilution or infringement of our intellectual property.
For example, adverse publicity relating to workplace accidents, including serious injuries or fatal
accidents, could have a negative impact on our business, including loss of existing job candidates or inhouse employees, loss of clients or regulatory action. Furthermore, negative publicity relating to the
temporary staffing industry, the use of foreign workers, the housing of foreign workers or
immigration/worker mobility more generally or the staffing industry more generally, whether or not
directly or indirectly related to any specific events arising from our own operations, could harm our
reputation through association, particularly if such negative publicity references us as an operator in


-----

such industry or makes any of our clients or job candidates reluctant to use our services as a result. For
example, in the past, we received negative publicity and were subject to litigation related to the failure
of a third party to provide adequate housing arrangements for job candidates who were recruited through
our international recruitment network. In addition, our German subsidiary SOLCOM has faced negative
publicity in the past in connection with a dissatisfied former shareholder. Failure to address, or
appearing to fail to address, these and other issues could erode client confidence in our reputation or the
brands of our Powerhouses. Restoring our reputation may be costly and difficult to achieve. Negative
publicity or negative public opinion may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract clients or job
candidates, or increase the costs of attracting and maintaining our client and job candidate base, the loss
of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We could incur liabilities or our reputation could be damaged from improper disclosure or loss of_**
**_sensitive or confidential company, employee, associate, job candidate or client data, including_**
**_personal data, or from other difficulties faced in the operation of technical infrastructure._**

In connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit certain personal data,
including personnel and payment information, about our in-house employees, clients, associates and
job candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally identifiable and sensitive. In
engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology and systems and those of thirdparty vendors we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems, mobile
technologies and social media. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally
identifiable or sensitive data or other operational failures may occur through a variety of methods. These
include, but are not limited to, systems failures, in-house employee negligence, fraud or
misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our inhouse employees, vendors or third parties, or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime
and/or state-sponsored organizations.

Computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general
hacking have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and could occur on our
systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts by third parties to fraudulently induce our
in-house employees or job candidates to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or
systems.

An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical
failure could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity,
regulatory enforcement actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of
revenue. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to
our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results;
however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.

Furthermore, we are subject to specific regulations regarding the use of personal data. Those regulations
generally impose certain requirements on the Group in respect of the collection, retention, use and
processing of such personal information. Specifically in the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation
(“GDPR”) came into force and has applied directly to the legislation of all EU Member States since
May 25, 2018, replacing historical EU data privacy laws, and implements more stringent operational
requirements for processors and controllers of personal data. Moreover, there are a large amount of socalled opening clauses, which could lead to differences between implementations of the GDPR in
European Union Member States. The implementation of these requirements of the GDPR is a burden
on the Group’s legal and compliance functions, in particular for international data transfers as they
occur in our business. The task to meet all the GDPR requirements is relatively complex. Therefore, it
is possible that we may be found to fail to meet certain requirements of the GDPR and its
implementations by the Member States. In case we are found to infringe provisions set out in the GDPR,
sanctions may be imposed. Our failure to implement the GDPR (including the implementing rules of
the EU Member States) could affect our reputation and relationships with our clients, or result in


-----

regulatory action against us for the infringement of data protection rules, any of the foregoing could
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. The GDPR
imposes administrative fines for data protection compliance violations of up to a maximum of €20
million or 4% of the company’s global annual turnover.

If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws or contractual obligations, or suffer a security
breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations
and this could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we seek to ensure that
procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the relevant data protection regulations by our inhouse employees and job candidates and any third-party service providers, and also implement security
measures to help prevent cyber theft, we nonetheless are exposed to the risk that this data could be
wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, stolen or processed in breach of data protection legislation.
Managing these risks have become more difficult in connection with working-from-home policies that
we adopted in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic and exposes us to additional risk for which
additional work, licenses and expertise is needed to detect and prevent the occurrences from happening.
Ransomware and cyber risks have increased in general during the Covid-19 pandemic and have also
required us to invest in even more strict back-up procedures, leading to higher operating costs for all of
its information technologies. In addition, concerns regarding our practices with regard to the collection,
use, disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in
negative publicity and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and thus on our
ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Any significant disruption in or cyber-attacks on our information technology systems, computer_**
**_systems or software or in the systems operated by third parties that we utilize for such services could_**
**_damage our reputation and result in a loss of clients or job candidates._**

Our brand, reputation and ability to support our in-house employees, attract and retain clients and job
candidates depends upon the reliable performance of our or our third-party suppliers’ servers, network,
cloud infrastructure, physical infrastructure, network infrastructure and content delivery processes (“IT
systems”). Like many businesses, we and our third-party suppliers have experienced in the past, and
may experience in the future, system disruptions that impact our IT systems. Any disruptions, outages
or delays in our IT systems, including as a result of fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure,
physical or electronic break-ins, earthquakes, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other events or
disruptions, could affect the availability of our services and prevent or inhibit the ability of our in-house
employees, clients or job candidates to access and utilize our systems or services. Moreover, we and
our third-party suppliers may not be able to anticipate evolving techniques used to effect security
breaches (which change frequently and may not be known to us until launched), or prevent attacks by
hackers, including phishing, ransomware attacks or other cyber-attacks, or prevent breaches due to
employee error or malfeasance, in a timely manner, or at all. Cyber-attacks have become far more
prevalent in recent years, potentially leading to unauthorized access to, misuse or disclosure of,
unavailability of, or the theft or manipulation of confidential and proprietary information, including
information regarding our clients and job candidates, as well as loss of access to, or destruction of, data
on our or third-party systems.

The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our IT systems or could cause
them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to
compensate for losses that may occur. An IT system failure at one site could result in reduced
functionality and productivity for our in-house employees, clients or job candidates, and a total failure
of our IT systems could cause our IT systems to be inaccessible by some or all of our in-house
employees, clients or job candidates. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems
with our IT systems could harm our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on its business,
results of operations and financial condition and thus our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes
and the Note Guarantees.


-----

**_We may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that_**
**_we will achieve our objectives._**

An important element of our strategies is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing
and employment services through the utilization of digital initiatives and the introduction of new endmarkets through acquisitions. The development of such solutions is often unique and presents costs,
risks and complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be unprofitable if we are
not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in implementing these solutions. For example, we
may fail to structure and utilize our solutions in a manner that properly compensates us for the IT
development costs associated with such innovations.

With respect to acquisitions, we regularly review and pursue opportunities for strategic growth through
acquisitions, including as a way to expand to new geographical areas and new market sectors. We may
face difficulties in identifying suitable target businesses or consummating a transaction on terms that
are favorable to us. In addition, we may be unable to realize expected strategic benefits, growth,
diversification of our end-markets or other financial benefits from such acquisitions in the timeframe
we anticipate or at all. Moreover, we may be unable to identify, negotiate or finance acquisitions or
other strategic initiatives, successfully or at favorable terms in the future. Any future joint ventures or
acquisitions of businesses, technologies, services or products might require us to obtain additional
equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. The parties to the
agreements will not consummate the transactions until the conditions are fulfilled, which could take
several months and, in exceptional circumstances, significantly longer. Accordingly, the parties may
not be able to complete the transactions in a timely fashion or at all.

Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we
cannot guarantee the successful implementation of our business strategies. Additionally, our strategies
may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment
of our existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results
initially expected, we may be unable to recover our investment or this may otherwise have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to
fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We have included certain historical financial information on entities that we acquired, which were_**
**_not prepared by us or reviewed by our auditors and in some instances, which were not audited at all,_**
**_or which were prepared on a different basis from our current IFRS financial statements, which may_**
**_not be reflective of our past performance or representative of our future results._**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have presented certain historical financial metrics of our business
unit accounts’ revenues and EBITDA, including figures on a pro forma basis from 2008 to the twelve
months ended September 30, 2022 in part to demonstrate the impact of the 2009 financial crisis on our
historical results of operations and to adjust for the impact of acquisitions we have done in the past as
well as certain non-recurring and extraordinary items. The pro forma historical figures set out in this
Offering Memorandum have been computed by adding the revenues of all of our acquired entities to
our historical statutory accounts for the applicable periods to present our total revenues, as if they had
been operating as a consolidated group at the relevant date. The historical financial metrics for the
acquired entities have been obtained from their individual accounts and are therefore not comparable to
our historical financial information. Some of these accounts may not have been prepared in accordance
with statutory requirements or the accounting policies used by these acquired entities may differ in
substantial respects from the manner in which we have prepared our accounts. For example, ABMI’s
statutory accounts are prepared on a French GAAP basis. This financial information may not reflect
what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Group operated as a
consolidated group or reporting segment during the periods presented. A number of estimates,
judgments and assumptions were made for the purpose of allocating those items that were not directly
attributable and/or separately identifiable. Furthermore, our historical financial information does not
necessarily indicate what our results of operations, had they existed with our current consolidation


-----

perimeter, would have been had we been a consolidated entity in the past, how our financial condition
will be in the future or how our operations might respond in the future to events similar to those
experienced by us in the past. We have also included certain financial figures of certain of our
competitors in this Offering Memorandum. The historical financial information of our historical
statutory accounts, our business units’ accounts and the financial reporting of certain of our competitors,
have been presented for illustrative purposes and those of our competitors are not necessarily
comparable and are not prepared on the same basis.

**_We may not realize the expected benefit of our past or future acquisitions or we may face unforeseen_**
**_costs or liabilities._**

In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and significant platform
acquisitions, and we intend to continue this combination in the future. Recent acquisitions during the
periods presented in the Financial Statements include several bolt-on and asset acquisitions in 2020,
2021 and 2022, and the acquisitions of new Powerhouses at the Group, including Cohedron in 2021 and
TMI and SOLCOM in 2022.

Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected
benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. These risks include, but
are not limited to:

- diversion of management’s time and attention from daily operations to the integration of newly
acquired operations;

- the possibility of not being able to retain key staff members and clients from the companies we
acquire;

- difficulties in conforming the acquired company’s accounting, books and records, internal
controls, and procedures and policies to ours;

- retaining the loyalty and business of the clients of acquired businesses;

- challenges arising from a lack of familiarity with new markets with differing commercial and
social norms and customs which may adversely impact our strategic goals or require us to adapt
our business model for and other regulatory frameworks;

- compliance with foreign legal and regulatory systems;

- difficulties integrating technologies and maintaining uniform standards;

- unforeseen legal, regulatory, anti-trust, pension liabilities, other contractual matters or other
issues;

- difficulties in maintaining timeliness and quality of service; and

- unanticipated costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities.

There can be no guarantee that we will be able to discover or fully assess any or all potential costs or
liabilities associated with any future acquisition.

Furthermore, we have in the past and expect in the future to operate and acquire businesses in countries
or markets where we are not currently present, with different regulatory systems and different operating
cultures, which may exacerbate the risks identified above. In addition, acquisitions are also subject to
the risk of overvaluation of the target and thus to the payment of consideration greater than the targets’
actual value to our business. We may also be unable to evaluate the scale of a potential acquisition,
which may result in being unable to allocate proper resources to execute the acquisition, while our
acquisition model expects we may acquire new business units which will have a great deal of autonomy.


-----

Even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses, we may not be able
to realize the potential cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements that were anticipated from
the acquisition, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we expect. Additionally, the costs of
achieving these benefits may be higher than, and the timing may differ from, what we expect.

Our failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies of past or future acquisitions could result in the
lack of implementation and achievement of our growth strategy may prevent us from obtaining the
advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We rely on search engine optimization, undertake digital advertising campaigns and utilize social_**
**_media and other online platforms to acquire new job candidates and clients, which may not be_**
**_successful or cost-effective._**

We rely on Internet search engines, such as Google, to direct traffic to our Powerhouses’ websites,
including our Powerhouses’ mobile websites. Search engines frequently update and change the logic
that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search, such that the purchased or
algorithmic placement of links to our websites may be negatively affected. Moreover, a search or metasearch engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing a
website to place lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms or results
in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of our websites, or if
competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization, search engine
marketing or other traffic-generating arrangements in a negative manner, it may lead to the loss of
existing job candidates or clients or hamper our ability to attract new job candidates or clients. In
addition, certain meta-search companies have added or intend to add various forms of functionality to
their sites. To the extent such functionality is promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings, this
may reduce the amount of traffic to our websites.

We also attract job candidates as well as new clients through paid marketing channels. In order to
maintain our current revenues and grow our business, we need to continually optimize advertising
campaigns, and paid search engine optimization aimed at acquiring new job candidates and clients.
Social media and online job boards have been an effective way for us to reach passive job seeker
candidates and our success in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to promote our
staffing services on third-party websites, such as Facebook, Google for Jobs and Indeed.com to whom
we pay fees to advertise. If one of the advertisers or social media platforms to which we direct online
advertising expenditures, use to promote our services or locate potential clients, were to increase their
fees, change their interface or experience disruptions in service, we may be required to incur additional
advertising expenses to acquire job candidates and clients. Furthermore, if any significant third-party
websites or platforms on which we advertise, promote our services or locate potential clients were to
lose their market position or otherwise fall out of favor with consumers or other factors cause their user
bases to stop growing or shrink, we may need to identify alternative channels for advertising and
promoting our staffing services, which could consume substantial resources and may not be effective,
or available at all. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition or result of operations and thus our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Note Guarantees.

**_Given that many of our job candidates are employees on indefinite term contracts, an_**
**_underutilization of such job candidates or any significant increase in staff costs or other direct costs_**
**_may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and_**
**_thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

Our Powerhouses regularly place medium to highly skilled job candidates who are engineers,
technicians or other white-collar consultants with clients on a medium-term to long-term basis, and the
job candidates in most of our engineering and consulting segment Powerhouses are employees with


-----

indefinite term contracts on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. In addition,
due to regulatory requirements, our job candidates in Germany are also our employees with indefinite
term contracts and on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. In light of the
above, the utilization of such job candidates (i.e., the time that can be billed to a client assignment) has
a significant impact on the generation of our revenue. If such job candidates are underutilized, we will
not be generating revenue, but we will continue to incur costs for these job candidates. Accordingly,
the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a client assignment, or “bench time,”
has an impact on our profitability.

The degree to which we are able to utilize and manage our job candidates is affected by a number of
factors, including:

- our ability to forecast demand for our services and to recruit, maintain and deploy job
candidates in alignment with demand, including job candidates with the right mix of skills and
experience to support client demand;

- our ability to transition job candidates from completed client engagements to new assignments
and to hire, assimilate and deploy new job candidates;

- our ability to manage retention;

- our ability to engage and motivate our job candidates and their level of productivity; and

- performance, including through seeking out new clients engagements or extending existing
clients engagements.

A number of these factors have been more difficult to manage as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Although our business activities have been restored to or surpassed pre-Covid-19 levels, a number of
our clients may still be uncertain of their staffing needs or hesitant to renew assignments for job
candidates as the Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way how job candidates approach working. The
war in Ukraine and the potential economic impact, as well as the global inflation and supply chain
shortage have also caused uncertainties on how companies fill their staffing requirements. Furthermore,
while temporary unemployment government measures implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic
allowed us to manage certain of our costs that come from underutilized job candidates, a number of
these measures, however, ended during the course of 2021, and the remaining measures expired as of
July 2022. Moreover, the significant economic volatility in today’s market, despite the recovery in GDP
growth for our geographical market following the Covid-19 pandemic, may lead to a reduction in the
funding and/or willingness of customers to engage us for our services, which could in turn lead to an
increase in underutilized job candidates.

Increased direct costs (resulting from salary inflation for existing or new job candidates or an increase
in headcount for our job candidates as part of our growth strategy or otherwise) without a corresponding
increase in revenue could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit. While it is important for us
to manage our additional client assignments or higher priced job candidate costs to maintain our gross
margin, a failure to increase pay in line with our competitors could restrict our ability to attract new job
candidates and retain existing job candidates, which could impact the quality of the services we provide
to clients and our ability to win new or to maintain existing client relationships.

If our costs increase at a higher rate than our revenue, whether due to factors that lead to less revenue
(including as a result of our job candidates being underutilized) or factors that lead to increased costs,
we may not be as competitive and profitability will be impacted. As a result, a material underutilization
of our job candidates or an increase in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Our interim results fluctuate as a result of seasonality in our business._**


-----

Our revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations in many of the end-markets in which we operate. We
have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience fluctuations in our results of
operations due to seasonal demand in our current end-markets. Seasonality varies depending on a
number of different factors and can impact our Powerhouses and our two business segments differently.
The underlying end-markets we serve are subject to various drivers that impact overall industry demand
and therefore demand from our clients for staffing. For example, the construction industry may
experience inclement weather or other causes on a worksite, which can impact demand for job
candidates. As a result of the mix of services we provide, seasonal work can also cause a peak in demand
during a specific period, such as the weeks leading up to Christmas and Easter, around harvest time in
the food production sector or around holiday periods such as the Christmas holidays and summer
holidays. Historically, as a general matter, our revenue fluctuates, with higher levels of revenue
typically being received in the second half of the year just after the summer holidays, which is then
sustained for a period before decreasing again in December due to Christmas holidays. We also present
certain unaudited monthly revenue and _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA financial information in this_
Offering Memorandum for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 derived from management
accounts, which typically display more seasonality and may be subject to adjustment at quarter-end,
and therefore investors should exercise caution when placing reliance thereon.

Moreover, we also experience seasonality with regard to our working capital requirements. We
generally experience larger working capital requirements in the first half of the year due to increased
holiday pay, bonus pay and tax payments. While our working capital requirements are generally lower
in the second half of the year, our working capital requirements also experience an increase at the end
of the year for end-of year bonuses and holiday pay, particularly as certain of our businesses institute
mandatory holiday at the end of the year. Furthermore, our results during 2020 were also impacted by
the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected the traditional seasonality patterns experienced by the Group
with respect to revenue and with respect to working capital (with a number of governments granting
postponements to certain tax or other expenses and providing grants for certain unemployment support
that temporarily decreased the Group’s working capital needs) compared to previous years.

**_Weaknesses and deficiencies in our controls generally or over financial reporting may prevent us_**
**_from managing our growth effectively, reporting our financial results accurately or result in a_**
**_material misstatement of such results._**

The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our controls. Controls over
financial reporting have inherent limitations, including human error or inaccuracies in recording
information or transferring information into systems, the possibility that controls could be circumvented
or become inadequate because of changed conditions, a lack of requisite personnel, lack of segregated
duties or controls, fraud or because of our decentralized structure across smaller business units. Because
of these inherent limitations, controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements or fraud. In addition, our organizational structure may make it difficult to implement
changes across business units in a consistent manner, including those required for internal control, other
controls and compliance. We could also face difficulties in bringing the controls, accounting procedures
and policies of the companies that we acquire up to the standard of our controls and procedures in time
for the reporting cycle following an acquisition, which could lead to inaccuracies or misstatements in
our financial reporting. If we cannot maintain or execute adequate controls over financial reporting or
implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the
financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to
our reputation, fail to meet our reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report
on our business or our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. Any of
the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We face risks associated with the collection of trade receivables and certain counterparty risk._**


-----

Trade receivables constitute a significant portion of our assets and are therefore a major business
investment. As of December 31, 2021 and as of September 30, 2022, trade receivables constituted
11.6% and 13.8%, respectively, of our total assets. Successful control of the trade receivables process
demands the development of appropriate credit, collection, and financing policies. In addition, we are
exposed to credit risk, meaning the risk that our clients and other counter-parties may be unable to fulfill
their payment obligations. Macroeconomic conditions have a significant influence on credit risk, as in
an economic downturn more clients tend to fall into default, which could be magnified for us as a result
of our exposure to SME and ISE clients, which may have less ability to raise capital from other sources
during a downturn. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate, a number of
businesses, particularly small businesses, have been supported by government measures. It cannot be
excluded that as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues or once these government measures
expire, such businesses, including our clients supported by such measures, may face cash flow shortages
or bankruptcy, which could impact our ability to collect trade receivables in a timely manner or at all,
particularly for those receivables which would not be covered by the Group’s credit insurance, which
has a maximum liability amount of up to €250.0 million and is held by all of our Powerhouses, except
for Cohedron and TMI. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly,
then our cash flow and profitability may suffer.

We are also exposed to counterparty risk with respect to certain credit insurance maintained by certain
of our business units, swap agreements we have entered into in respect of interest payments as well as
factoring agreements (for which our Group retains a credit risk and late payments risk). Financial
services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or
other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about the financial stability of
one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to
market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses and defaults. Many of these transactions expose us to credit
risk in the event of a default by one or more of our counterparties. If we fail to maintain a solid
collections policy or to manage our credit risk or if there were such an economic downturn in the
markets in which we operated or an impact on the financial services markets including our
counterparties, such a failure or event could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

**_Our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all the risks we face and, if we are no longer_**
**_covered by our existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable_**
**_terms or at all._**

Our policy is to maintain directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident, credit, general
professional liability, workers’ compensation (for Belgian entities only), motor third party liability,
travel, property damage and cyber insurance and additional insurance covering our main insurable risks
to the extent such insurance coverage is available for reasonable premiums. We may, however, become
subject to liability against which we have not been insured, cannot insure or are insufficiently insured,
such as employment practices liability, which could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition or results of operations. For example, to the extent any claims arise during a job
candidate’s assignment with a client which we expected the clients’ insurance to cover and it does not,
we may face uninsured losses in connection with any such events. In addition, we may not be able to
enter into new insurance agreements on commercially acceptable terms and conditions in the future.
For example, our business units in Belgium are required to insure occupational accidents through
specifically licensed private insurance companies, as a consequence of the Law of April 10, 1971 and
subsequent Royal Decrees. Furthermore, following the outbreak of Covid-19 in the markets in which
we operate, a number of insurance companies have increased or may attempt to raise insurance prices,
which we may not be able to fully recover by passing along these increased expenses in our negotiations
of client contracts and fees for our job candidates’ services. Given the nature of our operations, which
typically results in us placing our job candidates on our payroll while they are on assignment, we are
required to insure a significant number of persons. Since 2021, a variable premium rate has been applied
to our work accident insurance, with a base premium rate of 2.918%, a mid-case rate of 3.064% and


-----

worst-case rate of 3.097%, depending on the number of work accidents we have. This premium is
calculated based on the gross salary mass of our temporary workers. For 2021, we estimate that the
mid-case rate will apply, although the base premium rate could potentially still apply depending on the
recovery process of the individuals involved in work accidents, which would have a significant impact
on the calculation of the final compensation to be paid out and therefore impact the premium rate that
will be applied to us. We also estimate that the mid-case rate will apply for 2022, and at the moment
we are on course for the base premium rate; however, this expectation could change drastically
depending on any further occurrences of work accident in the remainder of 2022. The materialization
of any of these risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Changes in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect demand for our services._**

From time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils,
regulatory agencies, governments and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment
protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted by staffing services, particularly
temporary staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of staffing
arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some
locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups, or regulatory agencies, or
alternatively due to increased use of and preference for online job platforms and other digital
intermediaries which results in decreased demand for our services from clients, we could experience a
decline in revenue. For example, temporary staffing is generally impermissible in Germany without a
valid permit from the relevant authorities, and there can be no guarantee that regulations in our other
primary markets will not change in the future to prohibit the same. Also, new legislation has come into
effect in the Netherlands requiring employment housing to remain available for four weeks following
the end of employment of foreign workers, which has also led to an increased focus on separation
between employment providers and housing providers. While this separation is not currently legally
required, we expect it will be enforced in the future. Notwithstanding the above, there is currently no
clear indication as to the extent of what the required separation will be, and we cannot be certain at this
time whether a complete separation, or a full ban on the provision of housing to temporary workers by
employment agencies, will be legally required in the future and how that would impact the demand for
our services. In addition, the use of foreign workers by the staffing industry is also criticized and may
receive significant political, media or other attention from time to time. To the extent that this decreases
demand for our staffing requires, this could also result in a decline in revenue for the Group.

In particular, demand for our services from government and public sector clients related to the Covid19 pandemic may decrease over time. On July 20, 2021, we acquired Cohedron, which primarily advises
public authorities and municipalities and is currently a Powerhouse in our engineering and consulting
segment. We have increased business from services rendered to the government and public sector clients
during the Covid-19 pandemic due to, among other developments, work related to government support
measures, such as the TOZO scheme, as well as concerns related to the widespread personal debt issue
of the citizens in the Netherlands. The Covid-19 pandemic-related services and other work for
government and public sector clients has contributed to our revenue over the past year. It is unknown
to what extent business with such clients may decrease as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic lessen
or change over time. Demand for our services from government and public sector clients may also fall
as clients adapt to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and their needs evolve. We will continue to
monitor the situation, but the future impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects on the needs of
our clients are impossible to fully predict, and there can be no assurance that our increased business in
the government and public sector will be sustained.

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We may have to incur significant charges for impairment of goodwill or other material intangible or_**
**_tangible non-current and current assets._**

As of September 30, 2022, goodwill represented €1.2 billion or 49.5% of our total assets, and our noncurrent assets amounted to €1.9 billion and our current assets amounted to €603.1 million. As required
by IFRS, we test material assets annually for impairment. We have not experienced any material
impairments of goodwill during the three years ended December 31, 2021. We performed an
impairment test during the second quarter of 2022 given the rising interest rate in the current market,
which we consider to be an impairment indicator. Goodwill impairment in relation to the GRITT
Powerhouse was identified, as the recoverable amount was €40.9 million compared to the carrying value
of €54.2 million. We performed another impairment test during the third quarter of 2022 due to further
increases in interest rates, and identified no additional impairments. We therefore recorded a goodwill
impairment of €13.3 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2022, as we consider this change
to have a long-term impact. If we have any indication that the value of any of our material assets could
decline, including indicators such as an economic downturn, the ongoing impact of the Covid-19
pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its consequential economic impact or certain business
decisions, this results in an impairment test that could result in impairments of goodwill or of other
current or non-current assets, and if any such impairments were substantial, this would negatively
impact our operating profit. Any significant charge for impairment in the future could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition or result of operations and thus our ability to fulfill
our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

In addition, following the Transactions, we will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition
method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations). The application of purchase
accounting may result in significantly different carrying values for goodwill, intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment. Due to these and other potential adjustments, future financial statements
for the Group could be materially different and may not be comparable to our Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including but not limited to, risk of impairment of
goodwill and intangible and tangible assets, increased depreciation and amortization expenses over the
remaining lives of the acquired assets and recognition of temporary differences at the acquisition date.
None of the financial information in this Offering Memorandum have been adjusted to reflect the impact
of any changes to the financial statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Comparability of the Financial Statements.”_

**_Risks relating to template contracts and forms may have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under_**
**_the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

We maintain contractual relationships with a large number of clients across the jurisdictions in which
our business units operate. In order to efficiently manage these contractual relationships at each of our
business units, we employ general terms and conditions and standard templates in our contracts and
forms. Furthermore, certain of our business units work with a number of large corporate clients and are
sometimes required to adhere to their standard terms and conditions. As a result of the foregoing, we
are exposed to legal risks whenever such contracts contain drafting errors, execution errors (including
unsigned agreements), lack sufficient detail on the nature of our liability to the client, require
customized terms and conditions, or require additional analysis as to legal sufficiency. Such general
terms and conditions, standard contracts and forms used and signed by us may not comply with all the
applicable legal requirements at all times. Moreover, as our in-house employees receive incentivelinked pay, they could agree to non-standard terms in a bid to sign on new clients which may expose us
to additional liabilities. In addition, certain agreements with our clients contain indemnifications and
hold harmless obligations in favor of our clients. We are not always able to contractually exclude or
limit such potential claims and certain of our contracts therefore bear the risk of uncapped liability,
including certain agreements with our large corporate clients. There can be no assurance that we will
not experience these problems in the future, that the insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted


-----

against us or that we may not incur fines or other losses if any such problems should arise. Any of the
foregoing may result in claims for compensation, unexpected liabilities for the Group or other legal
consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_A significant portion of our revenue is derived from SME and ISE clients and we could be negatively_**
**_impacted by the costs associated by providing such service or adverse market conditions or other_**
**_factors that affect our SME and ISE clients._**

Our client portfolio is mainly composed of SMEs and ISEs, which have historically accounted for a
substantial portion of our sales. Key challenges we face in providing services to the SME and ISE
market include:

- serving as the expert in staffing needs to organizations that often lack internal HR resources
and ensuring our services meet their needs in terms of support, flexible decision making and
excellence in customer service;

- devoting resources to advise our SME and ISE clients on compliance with applicable labor
regulations, including health and safety requirements;

- investing in client relationships takes time and staffing assignments with SMEs and ISEs may
require more of such investment since typical average staffing needs may be for only one to
two job candidates at a time; and

- devoting significant resources to developing services tailored to their needs, standards and
specific requirements.

Furthermore, an economic downturn in the end-markets in which our SME and ISE clients operate
could have a negative impact on the demand for our services or the prices such clients are willing to
pay for our services. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the results of operations
and financial viability of SMEs and ISEs as many have had their trading interrupted due to lockdowns
and typically businesses of such size have difficulty accessing debt and equity financing. Although
certain government programs have been established to assist SMEs and ISEs, we can provide no
assurance that these schemes will be sufficient and a number of them have been, or may be in the future
discontinued, and as a result many SMEs and ISEs may be in danger of closing. Therefore, while
lockdown measures have lifted or eased, many of our SME and ISE clients may still be facing
significant difficulties in recovering from the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The current inflationary environment may also pose further financial pressure on our SME and ISE
clients as they may be less likely to be able to pass-through higher operational costs to their customers,
which may impact their demand for our services or the prices they are willing to pay us.

As a result, our focus on SMEs and ISEs could result in additional costs to the Group as compared to
our peers that are less focused on the SME and ISE market. Conditions or developments that affect
SMEs and ISEs in particular, which may be related to macroeconomic factors, including inflation,
regulatory developments, consumer trends or other factors leading to a material decline in SMEs’ and
ISEs’ demand for staffing services could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**Risks Relating to Legal Matters and the Regulatory Environment**

**_We are subject to extensive laws and regulations which may adversely affect our ability to conduct_**
**_our business and may reduce our future earnings._**

In many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Belgium and Germany, the employment services
industry is heavily regulated. These laws and regulations sometimes limit the size and growth of


-----

employment services industries in these countries. Some of the laws and regulations impact directly our
profitability; for example, the 2008 EU Directive of Temporary Agency Work seeks to guarantee those
working through staffing solutions providers equal pay and conditions with employees in the same
business who perform the same job duties, which led to an increase in our cost of services. Some other
laws and regulations restrict our sector expansion; for example, the use of staffing services by staffing
solutions providers in the local construction end-market is prohibited in Germany. Furthermore, in April
2017, Germany enacted legislation introducing equal pay for temporary workers as well as restricting
the length of temporary employment to 18 months, which led to a downturn in our business and an
adverse impact to our operating results due to the overtaking of temporary workers by clients, and which
legislation has continued to have an impact in subsequent periods. While we have systems and processes
in place to monitor our compliance with such laws, it is possible such systems could fail which could
have a negative impact on our financial results or reputation.

In addition, substantial changes to Dutch law governing temporary staffing came into effect from
January 1, 2020. These changes to regulation had some impact on our business, as they resulted in the
costs for temporary work increasing. For example, there are increased social security charges for
temporary staffing agencies in their capacity as employer, and we expect a formal separation between
employment providers and housing providers will be legally required in the future. Furthermore, payroll
employees will be entitled to all terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions, and
a temporary employment clause and the additional flexibility to enter into fixed term employment
agreements that are traditionally allowed are no longer applicable to payroll employees. As a result of
these regulations coming into effect in 2020, our cost of services has increased, but we also
simultaneously increased our sales prices for our job candidates’ services. While to date we have been
able to pass on the majority of these increases in costs to our clients through higher fees charged for our
services, this nevertheless leads to an increased cost for our services at clients, which may lead to clients
questioning the relatively higher cost of temporary/flexible staffing versus hiring permanent employees,
thus reducing their demand for our services. The impact of these changes cannot yet be fully ascertained
as it is still evolving following the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and while companies have
demonstrated increased demand for hiring flexibility in the current market, many of them have also
become more focused on cost savings, leading to less use of temporary work.

In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our job
candidates. For example, as a consequence of certain legal restrictions, certain deductions are not
allowed if the net salary paid to job candidates falls below minimum wage as a result. For these nondeductible costs, we send invoices to the workers. If workers do not pay their invoices and return to
their country of origin, we are left with the costs. Furthermore, changes in zoning regulations or their
interpretation could result in increased costs in order to house our job candidates. Covid-19 related
government measures relating to quarantine regulations and separate housing requirements for job
candidates at certain of our Powerhouses have also resulted in increased housing costs for job
candidates. Additionally, trade unions may use the political process to target our industry in an effort to
increase the regulatory burden and expenses associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing
workforce solutions. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our practices may
result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in our business. Furthermore, many countries are
also expanding restrictions on immigration and have introduced substantial penalties that may be
imposed on staffing solutions providers and their client for employing foreign workers without
necessary work and residence permits. As a result, there is a risk that we may incur greater expense in
connection with restrictions imposed on recruiting foreign workers.

In addition, the countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things:

- create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we
currently provide;

- require that new or additional benefits be paid to our job candidates;


-----

- increase payroll related costs such as general and medical insurance, workers’ compensation;

- require us to comply with additional social laws, including in relation to collective bargaining
procedures;

- require us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services;

- limit the circumstances under which temporary staff may be employed;

- reclassify the status or categorization of our job candidates under applicable social laws which
would require us to comply with additional requirements, including payment of additional
welfare benefits; or

- increase taxes such as sales or value-added taxes.

In some countries, we are able to utilize laws, regulations or governmental measures that incentivize
work and employment through governmental support programs, subsidies or other specific measures
which help generate demand for our staffing services and provide opportunities for us to place job
candidates or to be reimbursed for certain of their wages or salary costs by placing them in work. These
governmental programs include those supporting shift work, night work, students and training, amongst
others. If these programs are discontinued, there may be less demand for our staffing services. In
addition, should we or the administrator responsible for such programs determine as a result of reviews,
control procedures or otherwise that any of our job candidates or the work opportunity do not meet the
eligibility criteria for such programs after we have placed them, we may not be eligible for any subsidies
for such job candidates’ wages or salaries or we could be required to reimburse the government for any
subsidies that were already received, which could have a negative impact on our profits. Furthermore,
we also benefitted from temporary government measures introduced as a result of the Covid-19
pandemic, which have since expired and such expiration resulted in limited increased costs to the Group.

Any future regulations or interpretations from administrations thereof may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations because they may make it more
difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services (such as by increasing
employment taxes), particularly if we cannot pass on increases in costs to our clients. For example, on
December 17, 2020, the Dutch government approved a new law that aims to curb nitrogen emission,
which has had an impact on the Dutch agricultural sector given the country’s large amount of livestock,
and, in turn, caused the demand of our job candidates in this sector to fluctuate. Belgium has also passed
similar nitrogen emission-related legislation, which could have an adverse impact on our business there
as well. In addition, on April 21, 2021, the European Commission presented a proposal for a Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), which would amend the existing reporting requirements
of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and encourage corporate spending towards sustainable
activities across the EU. The European Council approved the CSRD on November 28, 2022 and the
application of the regulation is expected to take place in four stages, the first of which will require
companies that already fall under the CSRD to complete their first CSRD reporting on the financial
year 2024, with expected reporting deadlines in 2025. We expect that we will be required to comply
with the CSRD. We cannot guarantee how the new Dutch nitrogen regulation, the CSRD or any other
existing or potential environmental regulations will impact our governance structure and our day-today business activities. Future changes to regulations may have more stringent requirements that could
increase our cost of operations or impact the demand of our services, which may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and in turn impact our ability to fulfill
our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Potential vaccine mandates adopted in our primary markets could have a material adverse impact on_**
**_our business and results of operations._**

The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked debates around how to increase vaccine uptake around the globe,
and while at the moment none of the governments in our primary markets has imposed vaccine


-----

mandates, the European Commission has been encouraging its member states to step up in their
vaccination campaigns and address vaccine hesitancy. It is unclear at the moment whether there will be
any vaccine mandates imposed in our primary markets, and it is extremely difficult to predict the impact
that a vaccine mandate will have on us or on our job candidates should any such mandate be imposed.
Any vaccine requirement or vaccine mandate, if implemented, may result in employee attrition;
likewise, any failure to implement a vaccine requirement or mandate may also result in employee
attrition or resistance to returning to onsite work, either of which could materially and adversely affect
our business and results of operations.

**_Our staffing business is required to maintain and comply with a number of permits, licenses or_**
**_certifications, and our failure to maintain or comply with such authorizations may result in the loss_**
**_of our licenses, our existing clients or may hamper our ability to attract new clients._**

In some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including Belgium and Germany, our temporary
staffing business requires a variety of permits and licenses. Our business may be adversely affected if
we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable
regulations or requirements occur. In the event of non-compliance, our existing permits and licenses
may be revoked or we may be subject to a fine, and re-application for such permits and licenses may be
prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. For example, we are currently being
investigated by Belgian authorities for allegedly providing residential housing units that do not meet
the required quality of living standards. On October 31, 2022, the court of first instance ruled in our
favor, but the prosecutor has appealed and we expect the court of appeal to hear the case in 2023.
Although we believe any potential financial fines resulting from such investigations would not be
material to our overall business, such investigation could lead to a potential review and change of status
of our temporary worker agency license. Should the status of our license change, some of our clients
might prefer not to work with us until our license is restored to its previous status. Certain of our licenses
are also subject to periodic renewal. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not
obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

We also maintain various client quality certifications which authorize certain of our Powerhouses, such
as, among others, Abylsen, GRITT and Redmore, to supply services to our clients. A failure to renew
these quality certifications in future audits may cause us to lose existing clients and threaten our ability
to attract new clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

**_Breaches of the health and safety laws may adversely affect our business, financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

Our clients operate in a variety of end-markets in which our clients and our business units are often
subject to a number of increasingly stringent health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, our job
candidates working in these end-markets, including, in particular the construction, infrastructure and
defense sectors, may be subject to accidents at work, some of which have in the past and could in the
future, result in injuries, including severe ones causing disability or even death. In certain of the
jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be liable to our job candidates for damages or subject to
regulatory action as a result of unsafe working conditions at the client’s premises. We could also be
liable toward our job candidates or subject to regulatory action or loss of our license to the extent we
do not meet legal requirements with respect to such placement, for example submitting job candidates
to a medical examination for applicable placements in advance of the job candidate beginning work.
Furthermore, any failures of such standards by our clients or ourselves that generate adverse publicity
could have a negative impact on our reputation and our ability to attract future business, result in the
loss of existing job candidates affected by any such behavior or otherwise harm our business or
operations. In circumstances where a liability arises as a result of the actions of a client, we may be


-----

unable to recuperate or bring a claim in respect of any sums that we have paid in connection with the
relevant claim. Any failure to comply with the existing, or any future, standards applicable to our clients
may result in civil claims, criminal liability, regulatory action and penalties against us or our directors
or managers. For example, the labor inspectorate in Belgium is currently conducting an investigation
into one of our Powerhouses in Belgium for alleged criminal negligence in respect of health and safety
legislation relating to a fatal accident of a temporary worker on customer premises. Should we be found
liable, we could face fines, temporary or permanent restrictions on engaging in certain activities, and
temporary or permanent closures of one or more sites. Any such action could also lead to liability for
our directors or managers, which could, in turn, damage our reputation and impact our ability to
participate in public tenders for this Powerhouse. Any failure to prevent a health or safety risk from
occurring and causing damage or loss may materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial
condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and
the Note Guarantees.

**_Legal, regulatory or other adversarial action, including employment-related claims, could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our business._**

At any given time, we may be a party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising in the
ordinary course of business. These may include possible claims by clients or regulatory bodies against
us relating to:

- classification of temporary workers;

- employment of undocumented workers;

- failing to verify job candidates’ backgrounds and qualifications;

- job candidates’ misconduct or negligence; or

- fraudulent or criminal job candidate activities or misuse of client proprietary information.

We may also be subject to claims by job candidates or regulatory bodies (including in relation to actions
of our clients or any third parties that we hire). Some of these may include claims relating to:

- violations of labor laws such as minimum wage requirements:

- discrimination and harassment;

- wrongful termination or denial of employment;

- violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;

- violation of social laws, such as provision of adequate housing for foreign workers; or

- payment of workers’ compensation claims or other health and safety related claims.

In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we bring claims or may be pursuing other legal or
regulatory remedies. We are involved in contractual relationships with our clients and other third parties
that may cause us from time to time, by court order or by unilateral action, to enforce our contractual
rights against these parties. These claims may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged
losses, civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief. If any such claim is ultimately resolved
unfavorably, and we are required to bear all or a portion of the costs arising from such proceedings, we
may not receive compensation we were expecting, be required to incur additional expenses may be less
effective at enforcing our agreements in the future.

For example, the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of one of our Powerhouses in France,
who we dismissed for cause, brought two claims against us alleging that he is entitled for additional


-----

monetary payment for certain shares that he owned in the French Powerhouse of which he was CEO
and for certain shares he owned in House of HR. Although we believe that he is not entitled to such
additional payment as a result of him having been dismissed for cause, should he prevail in his claim,
our maximum potential exposure is €15.0 million. A decision is expected during the course of the first
quarter of 2023. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” In addition, SOLCOM has been a subject in
investigations by customs authorities in relation to suspected de-facto employment of freelancers. The
investigations were closed in 2021, and while it was concluded that no criminal offenses were
committed and none of the freelancers were deemed employees, we paid a total of €4.0 million to the
German pension insurance and the public prosecutor’s office in 2021 to minimize procedural costs.
Accent was also challenged in 2017 by the Belgian tax authorities for an alleged tax fraud relating to a
Luxembourgish construction in for activities prior to 2014, which Accent ultimately settled with the
Belgian tax authorities. Furthermore, there is currently a pending case before the European Court of
Justice regarding certain German staffing legislations, which stems from a law suit against
TIMEPARTNER concerning a labor law violation, which TIMEPARTNER previously won in two
instances. All parties involved in this case have provided statements, and we believe that the court may
take six to 14 months to issue a decision. We may be subject to other litigation and disputes, claims and
complaints, including adversarial actions, by clients, in-house employees, suppliers, insurers and others
in the ordinary course of business, which may have a material impact on our results of operations,
liquidity, capital resources or financial position.

Significant claims or a substantial number of small claims may be expensive to defend, may divert the
time and focus of management away from our operations and may result in our having to pay monetary
damages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees. In addition, adverse legal publicity or substantial litigation against us could negatively
impact our reputation, even if we are not found liable, which could also have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Our business may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights_**
**_on which our business depends or if we are subject to claims of intellectual property infringement._**

Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our
proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property, including the value of our brands. We rely
upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements and
patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely on certain
license agreements from third parties to utilize software or other intellectual property used within our
businesses. For example, certain of our business units rely on proprietary software that we have
developed internally or acquired, such as NOWJOBS, SWOP, Book’u, CV Creator, MyTests, Dora,
MyTools and Gighouse, as part of our digital initiatives strategy. Our intellectual property rights may
not prevent competitors from independently developing services and solutions similar to ours or from
using similar software to ours. In certain jurisdictions, such as Belgium, we also rely on a favorable tax
regime on copyright incomes to attract creative software developers. In Belgium, an ongoing reform
will make the favorable tax regime subject to stricter conditions. This may affect our ability to attract
or keep software developers. Furthermore, the steps we take may not be adequate to prevent or deter
infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former in-house
employees or other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and
the Note Guarantees.

We can also not be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights
of third parties. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement,
misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld.


-----

Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us,
may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets or proprietary
technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement or misappropriation of the rights of others
and to determine the scope and validity of our or others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights. We
may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be subject to monetary
liability and injunctive or equitable relief, which may prevent our use of others’ intellectual property or
proprietary rights if we are not able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Any
failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and other relevant_**
**_laws and regulations, and our compliance systems may not be sufficient to adequately prevent or_**
**_detect legal, financial and operational risks._**

We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to, among other things, prevention of bribery
and corruption, money laundering and illegal employment, as well as compliance requirement in
relation to data protection and minimum wage regulations, as well as trade and economic sanctions on
certain countries, persons, groups and/or entities, projects and/or activities. We are reliant on the
compliance of our in-house employees, job candidates and clients with applicable laws and compliance
policies implemented by us. There can be no assurance, however, that our in-house employees, job
candidates and clients will not commit criminal, unlawful or unethical acts, or that our compliance and
risk management will be sufficient to prevent or detect any breaches of relevant laws and regulations.
Any such acts or breaches of law could result in whistle-blower complaints, adverse media coverage,
civil and criminal investigations or other penalties and damages, which could cause considerable
damage to our reputation, thereby negatively affecting our business, financial condition or results of
operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We may not be able to detect and prevent fraud or other misconduct committed by our employees,_**
**_representatives, agents, customers or other third parties._**

We may be exposed to fraud or other misconduct committed by our employees, representatives, agents,
customers or other third parties that could affect our reputation and subject us to litigation, financial
losses and sanctions imposed by governmental authorities. Such misconduct could include hiding
unauthorized or unlawful activities, resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks of losses, improperly
using or disclosing confidential information, misappropriating funds, engaging in misrepresentation or
fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise improper activities or otherwise failing to comply with applicable
laws or our internal policies and procedures.

Our internal control procedures are designed to monitor our operations and ensure overall compliance.
Such internal control procedures, however, may be unable to identify all instances of noncompliance or
suspicious transactions in a timely manner, if at all. Furthermore, it is not always possible to detect and
prevent fraud and other misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect such activities
may not be effective. There is no assurance that fraud or other misconduct will not occur in the future.
If such fraud or other misconduct does occur, it may result in negative publicity for us.

**_Changes in the interpretation of tax laws, changes to tax rates, the introduction of new tax legislation_**
**_or challenges to our tax position may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes_**
**_and the Note Guarantees._**

We are subject to income and other taxes in various jurisdictions. The tax bases and rates of these
jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic, political and other conditions. Revisions to tax
legislation or to its interpretation (whether with prospective or retrospective effect) may also affect our
results, and significant judgment is required in determining our provision for taxes. Furthermore,
political, media or other attention may result in increased examination of our structures by tax or other


-----

authorities. Our tax liabilities and effective tax rate are affected by changes in earnings in countries with
differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the
respective tax laws and changes in our business.

In addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our
provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include
transfer pricing and reporting relating to intercompany transactions. We often rely on generally
available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the
relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. We are routinely subject
to tax examinations by the tax authorities and in the past have been required to pay adjustments as a
result of the findings of such examinations, including for additional social security payments for job
candidates. In such audits, our interpretation of tax legislation may be challenged and tax authorities in
various jurisdictions may disagree with, and subsequently challenge, the amount of profits taxed in such
jurisdictions. In certain of our jurisdictions, we may also be subject to criminal penalties if the tax
authorities find us to be in contravention of the applicable legislation. Although we believe our estimates
are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of any such audits and related litigation could be different from
any of our provisions for taxes and may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. The
occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_The Sponsor’s opportunity to conduct due diligence with respect to House of HR was limited, and its_**
**_due diligence may not have revealed all facts that may be relevant in connection with the Acquisition._**

Before making investments, the Sponsor conducts due diligence that it deems reasonable and
appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The objectives of the
due diligence process are to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and
circumstances relevant to a specific asset, to identify possible risks associated with such asset and to
prepare a framework that may be used from the date of the acquisition of such asset to drive operational
achievement and value creation in such asset. When conducting due diligence, the Sponsor typically
evaluates a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in
determining whether or not to proceed with an investment.

Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence
process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due
diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsor relies on resources available
to it, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third
party investigations. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and
other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive
practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions.

There may be liabilities that the Sponsor failed or was unable to discover in the course of performing
due diligence investigations into House of HR and its affiliates in connection with the Acquisition, in
particular given the timing constraints for, and the materiality thresholds that have been applied in the
context of, the due diligence investigations. Following the Acquisition, the Sponsor may learn of
additional information about House of HR and its affiliates that adversely affects it, such as unknown
or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities,
individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position
and results of operations.

The Sponsor’s due diligence investigation may not have revealed or highlighted all relevant facts
(including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or
helpful in evaluating the merits of investing in the House of HR. There can be no certainty that the
Sponsor’s due diligence investigations will result in the investment in House of HR being successful or


-----

that the actual financial performance of such investment will not fall short of the financial projections
the Sponsor used when evaluating that investment.

**_The Acquisition may entitle certain of House of HR’s customers and business partners to terminate_**
**_their agreements with House of HR as a result of change of control provisions._**

Certain of the agreements entered into by House of HR include change of control provisions. The
Acquisition may constitute a change of control under such agreements. On the Acquisition Closing
Date, counterparties to these agreements may have become entitled to terminate their agreements with
House of HR as a result of the Acquisition. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination
rights, which could have an adverse effect on House of HR’s business, financial position and results of
operations.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties that_**
**_the Sellers have provided to the Issuer under the Acquisition Agreement._**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Sellers have given certain customary representations and
warranties in the Acquisition Agreement related to capacity, title and certain business matters.
Nonetheless, third parties could seek to hold the Issuer responsible for any of the liabilities the Sellers
have agreed to retain, and the Issuer may not be able to enforce any claims against the Sellers relating
to breaches of these representations and warranties. The Sellers’ liability under the Acquisition
Agreement is very limited. Moreover, even if the Issuer is able to eventually recover any losses resulting
from a breach of these representations and warranties, the Issuer may temporarily be required to bear
these losses itself.

**Risks Related to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our significant amount of debt and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our_**
**_business, financial position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations_**
**_under the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

We have a significant amount of debt and debt service obligations. As of September 30, 2022, after
giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total as adjusted indebtedness (including lease
liabilities, net of sublease receivables, amounting to €160.3 million) in a nominal amount of €2,022.3
million, of which €1,549.1 million is senior secured indebtedness consisting of the Notes and drawings
under the Senior Term Facilities and the Bridge Facility. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Other
_Indebtedness,” and “Description of the Notes.” We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to_
exist for the foreseeable future.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have
important consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for the Issuer and its subsidiaries to satisfy their respective obligations
with respect to the Notes, the Facilities, the Bridge Facility and other debt and liabilities we
may incur;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash
flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, or other general
corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;


-----

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged;

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital
expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and
increasing the cost of any future borrowings;

- limiting our ability to obtain additional capacity for issuance of bid, advance payment,
performance and warranty guarantees for operative business purposes and increasing the cost
of any future guarantee issuances; and

- tax implications arising from the Transactions, tax deductibility of interest costs thereon, an
increase in our effective tax rate and tax jurisdictions involved.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes, the Facilities and the Bridge Facility.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our_**
**_debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We have the
ability to borrow up to €250.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and up to €125.0 million
under our Delayed Draw Term Facility (of which €114.1 million were drawn as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum), which will be secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis. The Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility
Agreement permit, and the Indenture will permit, the incurrence of additional debt, including additional
debt that may be secured on the Collateral. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge
Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement permit, and the Indenture will permit, us
to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur
indebtedness that may be secured on the assets comprising in the Collateral or that benefits from security
interests over assets that do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be
structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the
Notes or such debt is secured by liens that do not secure the Notes to the extent of the value of such
property and assets securing such debt. Moreover, we will be permitted to incur other debt that matures
prior to the Notes. Although the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility
Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement contain, and the Indenture will contain, restrictions
on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could
be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If the Issuer and its subsidiaries
increase their existing debt levels, the related risks would increase. In addition, the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement
do not prevent, and the Indenture will not prevent, us from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our obligations
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.


-----

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will_**
**_depend on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes_**
**_and the Note Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no business operations other than management of the equity
interests it holds in its subsidiaries. The Issuer is dependent upon the cash flow from its operating
subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including
its obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Given the Group’s international operations, it
has a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute
to our Group’s results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend
on the profitability and cash flows of their subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to
declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if
applicable. The Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under
applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in
respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability
of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject
such payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between
several entities of the Group may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted
to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In
particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited
to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective
debt when due. The subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation
to make payments with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees.

While the Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to
significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable
law.

**_We are, and following the Offering will continue to be, subject to restrictive covenants that limit our_**
**_operating and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien
Facility Agreement contain, and the Indenture will contain, covenants which impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments and investments;

- transfer or sell assets;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

- create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us;


-----

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of
_the Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we will be subject could limit our ability to_
finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and
activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the
Second Lien Facility Agreement require us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while amounts
under the Facilities and the Bridge Facility remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain
circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
require us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remains
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior
_Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the Senior Secured_
Credit Facilities Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you
that we will meet such financial ratio, which could result in a draw stop under the Revolving Credit
Facility. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement could result in an
event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement
and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, respectively. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of
default that is continuing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility
Agreement or the Second Lien Facility Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period and any other
limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the
relevant Facilities and the Bridge Facility, as applicable, and elect to declare all amounts outstanding
under the Facilities and/or the Bridge Facility, as applicable, together with accrued interest, immediately
due and payable. In addition, a default under the Facilities or the Bridge Facility could lead to an event
of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration
provisions, including the Indenture and the Second Lien Facility with respect to an event of default and
acceleration under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. If our creditors, including the
creditors under the Facilities or the Bridge Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot
assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those
amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make
payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our
creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which_**
**_we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our
obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Bridge Facility, the Second Lien Facility and
the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans, will depend on our future
performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success of our
business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and
other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our
control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that
currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing
will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the
Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding


-----

amount under the Facilities or the Bridge Facility. At the maturity of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
(including the Revolving Credit Facility, which matures six months before the Notes), the Bridge
Facility (with an initial maturity of November 3, 2023 that automatically extends to November 3, 2029
as long as certain events of default are not continuing), the Notes or any other debt that we may incur,
if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt
obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our
indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our
obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or
all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our
credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms
of our debt, including the Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Bridge Facility and the Second
Lien Facility, limit or will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these
alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply
with more onerous covenant or other terms, which could further restrict our business, financial position
and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose
of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such
sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash
to meet our obligations.

**_The Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Bridge Facility and the Second Lien Facility bear interest_**
**_at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash_**
**_flow._**

Debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Second Lien Facility bears interest at a variable
rate based on (as applicable) the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) for loan denominated in
Euro, the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”) for loans denominated in Sterling and
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) for loans denominated in US Dollars, respectively (in
each case, subject to a zero floor if less than zero), plus in each case, the applicable margin. Prior to the
Conversion Date (as defined under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Bridge Facility Agreement”),
loans under the Bridge Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR plus
an applicable margin (subject to a zero floor if less than zero). These interest rates could rise
significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing
cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes.
None of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement, the Second
Lien Facility Agreement or the Indenture contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion
of our floating rate debt.

Although we have entered into and maintain, and we intend to enter into additional, hedging
arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will
continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks,
including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging


-----

arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. If one or more of our counterparties falls into
bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become
worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging
agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.

**_EURIBOR or other benchmarks may be discontinued or change in the future._**

Various interest rate benchmarks (including EURIBOR) are the subject of recent national and
international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective,
including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011) and the cessation of the
publication of Sterling LIBOR rates and certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates after December 31,
2021, while others are still to be implemented.

These reforms and other pressures may cause EURIBOR, SONIA, SOFR or other such benchmarks to
disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or
otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain
benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors
should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant
interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level
of the published rate, including to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile
than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears
interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR, SONIA, or SOFR (or any of their successors
or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement (prior to the Conversion Date) and/or the Second
Lien Facility Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our
obligations which have not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest
applicable to such obligations may be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions,
specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations, although such provisions, if they are
dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as
intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant
time).

**_The interests of the Sponsor may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

As of the Acquisition Closing Date (excluding the impact of the ABMI acquisition), the Sponsor
indirectly held approximately 55.0% of the share capital of the Issuer and House of HR. As a result, our
shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and
capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes
to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. Our
shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders,
particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example,
the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Our Sponsor is in the business
of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete
directly or indirectly with us. Our Sponsor may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are
complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to
us. In addition, our shareholders have held, hold or may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the
Group. Our shareholders and their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing divestitures
(including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would
result in changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions
that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might
involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.


-----

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure**

**_The Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral and not all of the Guarantors will_**
**_initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Original Guarantor. Subject to and in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, we expect that the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior
secured basis by either the Post-Closing Guarantors on or prior to March 3, 2023. Such Post-Closing
Guarantors are expected to be incorporated in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. As of and for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the expected Post-Closing Guarantors represented 63.8%
of Like-for-Like Revenues of House of HR, 38.0% of the consolidated assets (excluding intercompany
eliminations) of House of HR and 89.1% of Like-for-Like EBITDA of House of HR. Further, on the
Issue Date, and until March 3, 2023, the Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further
described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in procuring such liens and/or such additional Note Guarantees within the time periods
specified. The Note Guarantees and the security interests will be limited to the same extent as those
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Bridge Facility and otherwise as set forth under “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests,” which limitations could be significant. See also “—Corporate_
_benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees_
_and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the_
_Collateral.”_

**_If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms_**
**_of the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to_**
**_certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the_**
**_Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are_**
**_entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement
of the Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after
certain events, including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turnedover amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging
the super senior obligations (including, among others, (following the designation of the Revolving
Credit Facility as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness that may
be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such
amounts toward discharging the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may
not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities are
greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of the Collateral
will, after all obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata
in repayment of the Senior Term Facilities, the Bridge Facility, the Notes (unless the Revolving Credit
Facility has been designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement) the Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the
Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes
will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims
of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets_**
**_could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Transaction Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
other security providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and


-----

collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets.
So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the other security providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by
the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling,
factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will be secured on a first-ranking basis
with security interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Senior Credit
Facilities and the Bridge Facility on a first-ranking basis and the Second Lien Facility on a secondranking basis. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the
Second Lien Facility Agreement permit, and the Indenture will permit, additional indebtedness to be
secured on the Collateral in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided
for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders
of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Prior to the Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement (such date of designation (if any), the “Designation Date”), the Security
Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that
consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior
lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors
in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which
aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority
Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security
Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then, in certain cases, creditors holding more than
50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total
Topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless
instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities
at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance
with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent
the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six
months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made
a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to purse within
three months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the
Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, if (i) the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the
Security Agent to pursue and (ii) (x) the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that
to delay issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement
proceeds and (y) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with
the enforcement principles and necessary or desirable to enhance the prospects of achieving the
enforcement objectives before the Security Agent has received any enforcement instructions from the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act in accordance
with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.


-----

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency
event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) and is continuing, the
Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any requirement to first consult with any junior creditors)
or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided
such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior
Creditors.

The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right,
power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate
indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it by a member of
the Group. In connection with any enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may
request security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any
loss, liability or expense (including legal fees).

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes (such
as indebtedness incurred as an additional facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement),
the voting interest of holders of the Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with
the amount of indebtedness we incur.

Creditors of any future Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests
of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue
their remedies under the Transaction Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous
for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the
shares of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such
entities securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes
will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Transaction Security
Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Transaction Security Documents,
except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes,
you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the
Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a
default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will be granted as_**
**_security for the Notes, future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure_**
**_the Notes and it may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral and the Collateral may be_**
**_reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

Holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets underlying the security
interests granted in favor of holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In the event
of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral following an event of default, the
proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been, or will be,
made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend
on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern,
regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the
condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.


-----

In addition, the Collateral will secure the Facilities and the Bridge Facility and may secure certain future
indebtedness of the Group. Not all of our assets will secure the Notes and the Indenture will allow the
Issuer and its subsidiaries to secure certain indebtedness (which may be structurally senior to the Notes
and the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that do not secure
the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and
the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will not
benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other
unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and their restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or
assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes.

While the Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional
security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of
future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations will be subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and certain important exemptions and carve-outs. The Agreed Security Principles that will
be set forth in the Indenture will include a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes
to be granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security
Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any security provided being
limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. See “Description of the
_Notes—Security.” Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the security or_
guarantees provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors.

The shares and other Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such collateral may
not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure
you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the
liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate include restrictions
on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to
operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be
prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby
decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Transaction Security Documents,
enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions,
governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such
consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result,
enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur, and the value of the
Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible
that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by
such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note
Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the
obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no
remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of
these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the
value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay
all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the
sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s
and the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of
the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties
enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Transaction
Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the
Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture or incur additional indebtedness,
including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, holders of such Notes or


-----

lenders of such debt would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered
hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the_**
**_Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance_**
**_periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or
voidance periods for such Note Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting
of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or
voidance periods in particular, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted
in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt.
The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment
each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted
or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period
applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to
enforce and/or it may be subject to recovery. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of
further subsidiaries as additional guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant
assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees thereof or the Collateral_**
**_across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Netherlands. The entities expected to provide Notes
Guarantees are organized under the laws of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The Collateral will
include the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of those jurisdictions, and
certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of their
subsidiaries in respect of debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency,
administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights
under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and
administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to
effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature
of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United
States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the
ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The
application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what
extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your
rights under the Note Guarantees and the Transaction Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit
any amounts that you may receive.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to_**
**_the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted_**
**_by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees thereof will not be granted directly to the
holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any
independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Transaction Security Documents or to
exercise any rights or powers arising under the Transaction Security Documents except through the
Security Agent, including as may be provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you


-----

will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes
will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral will be
subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over such
Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation
of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may
apply. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and
perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent
(“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes
under or in connection with the Indenture (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other
security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the
Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the
same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall
discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall
discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure
the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled
to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent.
Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.
In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions
and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct
are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the
Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.
See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with
respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of
these liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of
the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the
Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security
interest in the same Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor any of the Agents or the Security Agent will be
under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of,
any such liens, and none of the Trustee, the Agents or the Security Agent have any obligation to monitor
the acquisition of additional property or rights by the Issuer or the Guarantors or the perfection of any
security interest. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically without your_**
**_consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically,
including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the
asset sale covenant of the Indenture and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more restricted
subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an


-----

unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such
subsidiary and any Note Guarantees by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to
certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of
the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary
or of its subsidiaries.

Under various circumstances, the Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released, including pursuant
to the provisions described under “Description of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown.”

**_The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors,_**
**_including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any)
of non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of
such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity
or the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor
subsidiary of the Issuer (including French Bidco, which is a borrower under our Facility B and will not
provide a Note Guarantee) becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise
wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal
of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect
shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including
depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of
the Issuer. In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-Guarantor
subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default
under the Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indenture will not contain any
limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, which may be incurred
by these subsidiaries.

**_The insolvency laws of the Netherlands and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to_**
**_you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are_**
**_familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined below),_**
**_including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On the Issue Date or on or prior to March 3, 2023, as applicable, our obligations under the Notes will
be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by security interests over the relevant Collateral
(the “Security Interests”). The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Netherlands, and the Guarantors
are organized under the laws of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. With respect to the Issuer and
any Guarantor organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the “center of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union
Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is
situated. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in certain of the Group’s
subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany and security
interests in certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of
the Group’s subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of


-----

the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is
not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance
and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained
in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the
enforceability of a Note Guarantee against any of the Guarantors and the enforceability of the Security
Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee
if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer,
conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and
principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency
statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany
obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers
or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court if it makes certain findings, to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the
Security Interests provided by such security provider;

- direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note
Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund
for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is
found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise
set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.
In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security
Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not
constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.
The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Transaction Security
Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would
apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each of the Guarantors or security
providers under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests, as applicable. There is also the possibility
that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability
may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance
_and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued, or the Security
Interests created, the relevant Guarantor or security provider:

- issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering,
delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over
others, or created such security after its insolvency;

- issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent
business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed
equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note


-----

Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security
provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note
Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were
incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or
on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the
Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for
other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the
Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or
believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they
would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider
generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee
or created any Security Interest if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due;

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute; or

- its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern
prognosis.

Although we believe that the Issuer and the other Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving
effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in
determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note
Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of
valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date,
or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was
insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments
to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note
Guarantees and Security Interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral._**

The Original Guarantor and the entities that are expected to provide a Note Guarantee are organized
under the laws of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Enforcement of the obligations under a Note
Guarantee against, and/or any security provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject
to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and
defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note
Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under
the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or
Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of


-----

such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or
such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or
thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such
subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal
liability.

The Note Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e.,
a GmbH & Co. KG) for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect
shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such
GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore
are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Note
Guarantees provided by a GmbH will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation
language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document under which any Note Guarantee is
granted) and that are or will be contained in the Transaction Security Documents, respectively, designed
to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general
statutory laws. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG.

Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH or any other entity incorporated/established
under the laws of Germany may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 BGB and would therefore not
be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security
interest, among others, the third party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance
(kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third party creditors of the GmbH.

As a result, the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or
Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual
enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or
Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their
creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy or
insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that
the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided.
To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would
be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security
provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and
Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst
the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes
will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Note Guarantees and security.

See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be,
registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be
offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore
transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These
restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the
Notes to ensure that all offers, and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply
with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”


-----

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable.

Interests in the global notes representing the Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in
definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry
interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered
owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will be the registered holders of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of
principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes
will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry
interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect
participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the
Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to
the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely
on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and if investors are not participants
in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, they must rely on the procedures of the participant
through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes
under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right
to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent
it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor
to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests,
they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures to
be implemented through Euroclear and/or Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_**
**_will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar
securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions
that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption
may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after
completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market making
activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market making activity will be subject to


-----

limitations imposed by the Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there
may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not
be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized or incorporated outside the United States, and their
business is substantially conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of
the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside
of, the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain
New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect
service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the
Guarantors. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their
subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States,
you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of
recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject
to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i)
judgments of United States courts obtained against the Issuer and the Guarantors and the directors and
executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such
foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state
securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters, with
Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. For further information see “Service of Process and Enforcement
_of Civil Liabilities.”_

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under_**
**_certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection_**
**_with a tender offer, even if certain holders of the Notes do not consent to the tender offer._**

If a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) occurs, the Issuer may be required
to make an offer to purchase all the outstanding Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the date of purchase. In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the
Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the
Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not
be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control would entitle each
lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the
Second Lien Facility Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of
amounts outstanding to it under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility
Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, respectively, and could trigger put rights,
mandatory prepayments or accelerations under other existing or future financing arrangements of the
Group. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would
constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility
Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers,
recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such
corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do,


-----

may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture. Furthermore, the occurrence of
certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will be deemed
not to be a change of control if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is met. See “Description of
_the Notes—Change of Control.”_

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the
Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or
such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in
part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established_**
**_meaning under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain_**
**_that a change of control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, the Issuer
will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The definition of “change
of control” in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to any person. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly
established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject
transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be
a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of
“all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of
control has occurred and whether the relevant Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes.

**_We may dispose of certain assets or capital stock of entities in the Group._**

We may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, or other transactions that, in
our judgment, would be beneficial to us, even if such transactions might involve risks to you as
noteholders. For example, pursuant to the asset disposition covenant and other provisions of the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement, the Second Lien Facility
Agreement and the Indenture, we may, under certain circumstances, sell, convey, transfer or otherwise
dispose of material assets of the Group and, if meeting certain leverage ratios on an as adjusted basis or
otherwise having restricted payments capacity, distribute some or all of the proceeds therefrom to our
shareholders. Such a transaction would not constitute a change of control or a default under the terms
of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”
Additionally, we may issue, sell transfer or otherwise dispose of the capital stock of entities in the Group
for purposes of taking a dividend or distribution that would benefit us but not benefit you as the
noteholders.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described in “Description
_of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the_
terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”)) will
automatically operate so that, among other things, the references to the Issuer and Restricted
Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) (and all related provisions)
shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Notes—IPO Debt
_Pushdown”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown_
Entity would be released from its obligations under the Indenture.


-----

Such modifications to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place
after such modifications (the “New Notes”). If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain
or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a
deemed exchange could be treated as issued with OID. In such event, U.S. Holders (as defined under
“Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would
generally be required to include the OID in their income (as ordinary income) as it accrues, in advance
of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of whether the New
Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional
payments, as further described under “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income
_Tax Considerations—Additional Payments,” would be made at the time of the modification. U.S._
Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating
to potential modifications of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown, including the U.S.
federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if any.

It is also possible that the IPO Debt Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other
than U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes issued
under such Indenture receive any two of the following ratings: Baa3 or higher from Moody’s, BBB- or
higher from S&P or BBB- or higher from Fitch, and no default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time as such Notes are no longer rated
investment grade by either rating agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes.
See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of
_Investment Grade Status.” At any time when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among_
other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness
without restriction, each of which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be
no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if
achieved will be maintained.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating
agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given
period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating
agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal
at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may
adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value
and trading of the Notes.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that the Notes will become or remain
listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the
Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer


-----

may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange does not imply that a public offering of any of the Notes in
the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man has been authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the
liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized
listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing of the Notes on the Official
List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange or the delisting of the Notes from the
Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s
ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign currency exchange as a result of investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the
Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes
in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over
which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in
the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a
U.S. dollar basis. Investments in the notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences
as a result of foreign exchange gains, if any.

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the TIA (as defined below)._**

The Indenture will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended (the “TIA”) and will not incorporate or include and will not be subject to any of the
provisions of the TIA. Consequently, the holders of Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided
under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting
preferential collections by the Trustee or conflicting interests of the Trustee. See “Description of the
_Notes.”_

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater than or equal
to a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will be considered to be issued with OID for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest
on a note, a U.S. Holder (as defined under “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations”) generally would be required to include such OID in gross income (as_
ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant yield basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in advance
of the receipt of cash payments to which such income is attributable and regardless of the holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain Taxation Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations--Original Issue Discount.”_

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Acquisition**

On May 28, 2022, the Issuer entered into the Acquisition Agreement, by and among, inter alios, the
Issuer and the Sellers relating to the transfer by the Sellers and the acquisition by the Issuer, directly
and/or indirectly, of all of the issued and outstanding share capital of House of HR. The Acquisition
was consummated on November 3, 2022.

The Purchase Price for the Acquisition, including the repayment of the Existing Notes and the Existing
Facilities, was €2,676.7 million. In addition, the Acquisition Agreement contains certain agreed earnouts which may subsequently become payable to the Sellers in the event that certain conditions are met
in the future, including an earn-out of up to €110.0 million depending on the level of the Group’s
EBITDA for the fiscal years 2022 and 2023.

Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, on the Acquisition Closing Date, Naxicap Partners,
Ms. Vandendriessche, House of HR’s co-founder, and certain reinvesting managers and other minority
shareholders reinvested a certain portion of their Acquisition proceeds (or rolled over all or part of the
shares they held, directly or indirectly, in House of HR), through either (i) contributions in cash, (ii)
roll-up contributions of part of the receivables they would come to hold against the purchaser (or any
of its affiliates) in the context of the Acquisition (in respect of the purchase price due to them) or (iii)
contributions in kind of their respective shares in House of HR or the Dutch management vehicle in
exchange for ordinary shares and fixed-return preferred shares issued by Holdco, an indirect parent of
the Issuer. See “—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” below. The contributions (in cash or
in kind) referred to in this paragraph are collectively referred herein as the “Shareholders’
Reinvestment.”

Although the Sellers have given certain customary representations, warranties and indemnities as to,
_inter alia, capacity, title and certain business matters in the Acquisition Agreement, the Issuer may not_
be able to enforce claims against the Sellers relating to breaches of these representations, warranties
and indemnities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not be able to enforce
_claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties that the Sellers have provided to the_
_Issuer under the Acquisition Agreement.”_

**_Sources and Uses for the Acquisition and other Transactions_**

The funding sources for the Acquisition, the repayment or refinancing of the Existing Notes, the
Existing Facilities and certain other debt, and the payment of related fees and expenses and other costs
related to the Transactions consisted of proceeds from the following sources:

  - equity contributions from Bain Capital and other co-investors in the form of subscription to
ordinary shares and fixed-return preferred shares issued by Holdco (the “Pari passu Shares”)
equaling approximately €596.8 million and contributed to the Issuer through intermediate
holding companies (the “Shareholder Equity Contribution”); and (ii) the Shareholders’
Reinvestment and investment from new managers of approximately €488.2 million, which
includes approximately €4.8 million of rollover equity in Topco from strategic minorities; and

  - drawings under Facility B in an aggregate amount of €1,020.0 million and (ii) drawings under
the Second Lien Facility in an aggregate amount of €310.0 million; and

  - drawings under the Bridge Facility in the aggregate amount of €415.0 million, which will be
refinanced using the proceeds from the offering of the Notes (see “—The Refinancing” below).

In addition, on the Acquisition Closing Date, we drew €114.1 million under the Delayed Draw Term
Facility for general corporate purposes, including to finance or refinance amounts used in connection
with recently completed acquisitions and to finance the acquisition of ABMI which is expected to


-----

complete in December 2022, subject to the put option being exercised by the sellers, regulatory
approvals and customary closing conditions. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisitions.”

The notional sources and uses necessary to (i) consummate the Transactions, including the Acquisition
but excluding the Offering, (ii) repay the Existing Notes and the Existing Facilities, (iii) finance or
refinance amounts used in connection with certain acquisitions closed in 2022, (iv) finance the
acquisition of ABMI which is expected to complete in December 2022, subject to the put option being
exercised by the sellers, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and (v) pay fees and
expenses in connection with the foregoing transactions are shown in the table below. Certain amounts
presented have been estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Actual amounts may vary
from estimated amounts based on several factors, including actual cash amounts available to the Issuer
and/or House of HR, the actual purchase price from the ABMI acquisition (including the actual amount
of indebtedness outstanding and actual amount of cash available to ABMI at completion of the ABMI
acquisition) and any differences between estimated and actual fees and expenses. Any changes in these
amounts may be funded through other cash sources available to the Group. This table should be read in
conjunction with “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds.”

**Sources of Funds** **(€ million)** **Uses of Funds** **(€ million)**

used to partially refinance amounts drawn under the Bridge Facility and pay related fees and expenses. See “ —The Refinancing”
and “ Description of Other Indebtedness.”

(2) Represents the aggregate principal amount drawn under Facility B.

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount drawn under the Delayed Draw Term Facility on the Acquisition Closing Date for
general corporate purposes, including to finance, refinance or refund amounts used by House of HR to fund certain acquisitions
completed in 2022 and pay certain fees related to the drawings under the Delayed Draw Term Facility. See “ Summary—Recent
_Developments—Acquisitions.”_

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount drawn under the Second Lien Facility.

(5) Represents (i) the Shareholder Equity Contribution from Bain Capital and other co-investors to the Issuer in the form of subscription

and (ii) approximately €18.1 million of expected equity reinvestments provided by Omnes, ABMI and Abylsen managers to be
provided on or about the date of completion of the ABMI acquisition. See “ The Transactions.”

(6) Represents (i) amounts used to fund the agreed consideration paid to the Sellers on the Acquisition Closing Date (excluding any

of €142.4 million, and including €4.8 million rollover equity from minorities) pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, (ii) the
prepayment and cancellation, or redemption in full, of net amounts under the Existing Notes and the Existing Facilities, including
early redemption premium and other fees, and (iii) the funding, financing, refinancing or refunding of amounts paid in connection
with certain recently completed acquisitions of House of HR (see “ Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisitions”).

(7) Represents the estimated consideration payable for the acquisition of ABMI (including the repayment of certain existing debt of
ABMI outstanding on the date of completion of the ABMI acquisition), as adjusted for our estimates of certain notified cash leakage
items and certain other adjustments required under the purchase agreement. Actual consideration paid for the ABMI acquisition
may vary due to various factors, including, among others, the date of consummation of the acquisition, the amount of cash available
at ABMI, the amount of accrued interest and the amount of any prepayment premium on existing debt of ABMI as of the closing
date and any adjustments to the cash consideration paid pursuant to the purchase agreement on the closing date. The acquisition of
ABMI is expected to complete in December 2022 but remains subject to the put option being exercised by the sellers, regulatory
approvals and customary closing conditions. See “ Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisitions—Future Acquisitions.”

(8) Represents the estimated amount of cash available to the Issuer and/or House of HR following the Acquisition Closing Date for

professional fees. Certain of these fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are
subject to change. Additional fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering and the Refinancing are excluded from
this amount. See “ Use of Proceeds.”

**_The Refinancing_**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Issuer entered into the Bridge Facility Agreement, which
provides for the Bridge Facility in an aggregate principal amount of €415.0 million. The Issuer used the
proceeds from the Bridge Facility, the Shareholder Equity Contribution and drawings under the Senior
Term Facilities and the Second Lien Facility as described above under “—The Acquisition—Sources
_and Uses for the Acquisition and other Transactions.”_

We estimate that the proceeds from the Offering will be €300.0 million. The proceeds from the Offering
will be used by the Issuer for the Refinancing, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the
Offering and the Refinancing. See “Use of Proceeds.” Following the Refinancing, €115.0 million will
remain outstanding under the Bridge Facility.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby is €300.0 million. The proceeds from the
Offering, together with cash on hand, will be used to partially repay the indebtedness incurred under
the Bridge Facility, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to pay fees and expenses in
connection with the Offering and the Refinancing.

The following table sets forth the estimated sources of funds and uses of proceeds in connection with
the Offering. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including
the amount of accrued and unpaid interest under the Bridge Facility on the date of repayment and
differences in the actual amount of fees and expenses compared to our estimates.

The table below should be read in conjunction with “Capitalization” and “The Transactions.”

an assumed date of repayment.

(3) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Offering and the Refinancing, including legal and advisory and other
fees, transaction costs and professional expenses. These fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum and are subject to change. Refinancing costs exclude (i) fees and expenses related to funding the Bridge Facility,
(ii) accrued but unpaid interest on the Bridge Facility, (iii) additional expenses in connection with Transactions other than the

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth, in each case, as of September 30, 2022, the consolidated cash and cash
equivalents and the consolidated capitalization of:

(i) House of HR and its subsidiaries on a historical basis derived from our Unaudited Interim

(1) Historical cash and cash equivalents include €21.0 million of restricted cash comprised of deposits subject to regulatory restrictions
in the Netherlands (system of G-accounts containing amounts for taxes to be paid on salaries) or relate to deposits for
buildings/branches and are therefore not available for general use by the other entities within the Group. Historical cash and cash
equivalents reflects cash and cash equivalents of House of HR as of September 30, 2022. As adjusted cash and cash equivalents as
of September 30, 2022 represents cash of the Issuer adjusted for (i) the Acquisition of House of HR and the other Transactions,
including the (a) repayment of the Existing Notes and the Existing Facilities and (b) payment of estimated fees and expenses in
connection with the Transactions including the Offering and the Refinancing (but excluding approximately €3.8 million of
estimated accrued and unpaid interest on the Bridge Facility to, but excluding, an assumed date of repayment), (ii) additional cash
from (a) the Shareholder Equity Contribution made available on the Acquisition Closing Date and (b) expected equity
reinvestments provided by Omnes, ABMI and Abylsen managers to be provided on or about the date of completion of the ABMI

**Overview**

We are a leading provider of HR solutions in key European staffing markets, offering end-to-end
temporary recruiting and outsourcing services. We supply specialized and niche staffing to primarily
small and medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) clients in a diversified range of end-markets. We offer and
tailor our services to the staffing needs of our clients through our engineering and consulting segment
and specialized talent solutions segment, which are comprised of a well-developed portfolio of ten
specialized business units, which we call Powerhouses, across various countries. We also offer digital
recruiting through our dedicated platforms, using our digital tools, including, NOWJOBS, SWOP and
Gighouse app, targeting low-skilled, high-volume markets with significant roll-out potential.

Since our founding, we have expanded from a presence in only Belgium to more than 10 countries in
Europe. Corresponding to our geographic expansion, we have also become more diversified in the endmarkets we serve, primarily through our acquisitions in recent years, which provide us with staffing
capabilities in additional areas such as pharmaceutical, healthcare, life sciences, government and public
administration and technology. As of September 30, 2022, we had 72,296 job candidates at work and
approximately 40,858 productive people at work (meaning the number of our job candidates adjusted
to reflect a 38 hour per week workweek) and 4,734 in-house full-time equivalent employees. For the
twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we had 31,456 unique clients, our Pro Forma Management
Adjusted Revenue was €2,770.0 million and our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA was_
€330.5 million.

Our engineering and consulting segment represents 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022. This segment supplies staffing of highly-skilled professionals, such as engineering
consultants and financial and insurance specialists, to fill specialized roles in a variety of end-markets,
such as financial, industrial, logistics, infrastructure, public administration and construction, and, more
recently, fast-evolving and highly resilient sectors such as energy, telecommunications,
pharmaceuticals and technology. This segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu Professionals,
Redmore, GRITT, Cohedron and SOLCOM Powerhouses and has the broadest geographic footprint,
with its primary operations in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The engineering and
consulting segment assists clients in the search and selection of the right candidate, including for interim
management and secondments, and such temporary client assignments generally last for months. The
below chart illustrates in blue the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for
our engineering and consulting segment.


-----

Our specialized talent solutions segment represents 46.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022. This segment supplies specialized staffing of high-demand mid-skilled workers
for specialized positions, such as clerical positions, carpenters, nurses and machine engineers, as well
as blue-collar workers to companies in certain sectors, including construction, retail, finance, food,
healthcare and construction. This segment is comprised of our Accent, Covebo, TIMEPARTNER and
TMI Powerhouses, with their primary operations in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as
branches in countries that form part of their international recruiting networks, which currently operate
principally for this segment though we are planning to expand them for our engineering and consulting
segment. These international branches provide us with the capability to source foreign candidates to
bridge the large gap between the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates,
especially as the labor market in our Addressable Markets has tightened over the past few years. The
Specialized Talent Solution segment generally delivers job candidates through temporary agencies to
clients in a fast and flexible way when they are shorthanded, with duration of job placements typically
lasting for weeks, but they could also last hours or months depending on the needs of our clients. The
below chart illustrates in pink the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for
our Specialized Talent Solution segment.

We serve as an intermediary between job candidates and their ultimate employer by matching up
candidates that are looking to find a job, gain experience or find variety or flexibility with our clients
that are looking for specialist skills, flexible employee arrangements, time and cost efficiencies or to
cover peaks or sourcing for particular projects. We source and screen candidates, provide candidate
matching services and present candidates to the client. We also assist with the hiring of the candidates
by customers, client and candidate retention, provide timesheet, invoicing and payroll services, and
regularly follow up with clients. We aim to help our clients at all stages of the recruiting process to
relieve their management from the burden of having to seek appropriate job candidates for available
positions. To ensure that we are able to tap into skilled workforces, we offer career coaching to job
candidates in order to help them find career paths that align with their professional goals, and we provide
in-house training to equip them to match the job profiles in which they are interested or that are scarce
in the market to increase job candidates’ employability. We also offer support to foreign job candidates,
including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance.

We enter into employment contracts with the candidates and pay their salaries. We enter into placement
contracts with our clients and bill our clients for our services. Our bill-pay spread is a key driver of our
profitability and supports our industry-leading gross margins. We maximize bill-pay spread as a result
of candidate scarcity, our niche focus, our SME and local customer focus, our premium service offering,
our excellence in marketing candidates to jobs and non-solicitation or minimum fee/period protection
for candidates in respect of clients. We have strong pricing power driven by contractual dynamics that
ensure pass-through of salary increases. Our specialized talent solutions segment benefits from
contractual dynamics which allow for an automatic pass-through to clients of price increases, and our
business model also allows for limited bench risk because staffing contracts are back-to-back. In our


-----

engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with
our clients, and we effectively manage to keep our bench time low by matching confirmed upcoming
client assignments to candidates. The business model of these two segments has enabled us to establish
a track record of margin stability even during challenging economic conditions such as the Covid-19
pandemic and in the inflationary environment in 2022.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we generated 27.6%, 39.8%, 26.0% and 5.5% of our
_Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France,_
respectively. We have branches in the countries where we source job candidates, including Poland,
Romania, Spain, Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal. As of September 30, 2022, we had a network
of 742 branches and 18 recruitment offices. To complement our physical network of branches and reach
new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies, including our SWOP
application, our SWOP Recruiter application and our NOWJOBS platform. We have increased our
focus on developing digital support growth initiatives for our primary operations to enable us to reach
additional job candidates or serve new end-markets in a fully digital manner.

We support businesses by providing flexible staffing solutions that are used throughout all stages of the
economic cycle, resulting in our resilience during economic downturns. While the economy is strong,
the job market tightens meaning that our clients need help sourcing candidates. As markets soften,
companies typically shift to a more temporary workforce and need staffing solutions and flexibility.
When markets reach the bottom of the cycle, temporary staffing suffers but then is characterized by a
quick recovery as temporary employment tends to recover faster than permanent employment. For
example, during the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, our business recovered from the early losses in
approximately three to six weeks. We also have a highly variable cost base and the ability to pass on
wage inflation, which supports the stability of our gross margins. For example, our Like-for-Like
Revenue growth (based on the December 31, 2021 perimeter) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 fluctuated
significantly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and were 2%, (9)% and 19%, respectively,
but we were able to maintain a gross margin of approximately 28% throughout this period. Flexible
staffing solutions proved instrumental in the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic,
resulting in a full recovery of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the Covid-19
pandemic, the retail, food retail and hospitality sectors were severely impacted across all our key
markets due to lockdowns and other restrictive measures, which led to a significant reduction in our
staffing activities in these sectors. Certain sectors, such as logistics and education, however, proved to
be less sensitive to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, and clients in these sectors continued to seek
our services, particularly for high-skilled, specialized roles. In addition, demand for staffing services
from municipalities and government agencies during the Covid-19 pandemic increased due to, among
other developments, work related to the administration of government support measures, which we were
able to capitalize on given our specialization in this end-market provided by the Cohedron Powerhouse
in our engineering and consulting segment.

We were founded in 1995 by Philip Cracco and Conny Vandendriessche along with a financial sponsor
as a Belgium-based recruiting firm. Originally called Accent, we changed our name to House of HR in
2012. Over the course of 2012 to 2014, Naxicap, a French private equity firm, acquired a majority stake
in our business, and we have expanded significantly to become a leading provider of specialized HR
solutions in multiple European markets. On November 3, 2022, Bain Capital acquired a majority stake
in the Group, with Naxicap, Conny Vandendriessche and management maintaining stakes. See “The
_Transactions.”_

**Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

**_Acquisitions, Disposals and the Comparability of our Financial Statements_**

During the periods under review, our growth and expansion has accelerated through platform
acquisitions, such as those of Cohedron B.V. (“Cohedron”) in 2021 and TMI and SOLCOM in the first
quarter of 2022, which became new Powerhouses of our Group, as well as bolt-on acquisitions, which


-----

we refer to as Boutiques, that strengthen or complement the position of our Powerhouses and contribute
to our international recruiting network. Our M&A capital expenditure were €39.4 million, €16.6 million
and €190.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and was €303.5 million for

and approximately €8.2 million, respectively, and has an enterprise value of approximately
€60.0 million, based on our due diligence in respect of the target.


-----

- On November 14, 2022, we acquired Job Raccoon in an asset deal to supplement our
TIMEPARTNER Powerhouse. Job Raccoon is a German recruitment agency using an internetbased recruitment platform specializing in the recruitment of blue-collar workers. At
completion, there was an upfront payment for this acquisition in an amount of €0.3 million. In
addition, the purchase agreement includes an earn-out in an amount not to exceed €0.5 million
in total, which may become payable if certain condition precedents are reached.

Additionally, in the period under review the Group completed one material disposal:

- On June 23, 2020, we entered into a share and receivable transfer agreement to sell GRITT
Projects as its business model was not aligned with the Group’s overall strategy and was not
delivering the expected performance. The Group, via its subsidiaries GRITT NV and LogiTechnic NV held 100% of the shares in GRITT Projects NV. The sale of GRITT Projects NV
entailed (i) a capital increase done by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV of €3.2 million; (ii)
the sale of the shares held by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV, against EUR 1 closing price;
and (iii) the price supplement of €0.4 million. As a result, a total loss of €19.6 million was
recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020.

See note 3.1 to each of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

We also have a number of other potential targets in our pipeline for 2022: we have submitted one nonbinding offer, we are currently reviewing the investment memorandum for one target and we have made
non-committal contact for several other targets. We have also lost out on nine potential acquisition
opportunities in 2022. These offers are in line with our strategy to further invest in niche staffing, focus
on digital and expand also in the engineering and consulting segment. The offers are in line with past
acquisitions in terms of size and profitability. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisitions.”

Our acquisitions have resulted in increased revenue and increased geographical coverage, as well as
improved diversification of our services and the number of clients and end-markets that we serve. On
account of the number of acquisitions that we have undertaken and intend to continue to undertake, our
results of operations from period to period may not be comparable.

Acquisitions, which include the acquisition of majority stakes in equity investments or joint ventures
that were previously not accounted for as part of our consolidation perimeter, affect our results of
operations on inclusion in our consolidation perimeter. For example, during the year ended December
31, 2019, we accounted for Book’u as an associate; however, on May 19, 2020, we acquired a majority
stake in Book’u, and as a result, a full consolidation has been recorded for Book’u in the year ended
December 31, 2020. In addition, as acquired businesses are consolidated from the date of their
acquisition, the full impact of an acquisition is only reflected in our consolidated income statement and
statement of cash flows in the subsequent financial year.

Our cost of services, selling expenses and other general and administrative expenses have typically
increased in proportion to the size of the acquisitions we have undertaken. Certain acquisitions,
however, have created opportunities for margin improvements, particularly where such acquisitions
have shifted the services mix we offer from more general to more specialized, or where such
acquisitions have been in our engineering and consulting services segment, since more specialized job
candidates are typically in greater demand and can thus result in our Group having greater pricing power
when placing job candidates.

Because of the number of acquisitions we have undertaken and the nature of the businesses we acquire,
we carry a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2022, goodwill
represented €1.2 billion or 49.5% of our total assets. Our goodwill is reduced by any accumulated
impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. If an impairment
charge were made, we may record significant charges in our income statement under IFRS. For


-----

example, we performed an impairment test during the second quarter of 2022 given the rising interest
rate in the current market, which we consider to be an impairment indicator. Goodwill impairment in
relation to the GRITT Powerhouse was identified, as the recoverable amount was €40.9 million
compared to the carrying value of €54.2 million. We performed another impairment test during the third
quarter of 2022 due to further increases in interest rates, and identified no additional impairments. We
therefore recorded a goodwill impairment of €13.3 million for the nine months ending September 30,
2022, as we consider this change to have a long-term impact. Our margin based on current goodwill
impairment tests appears to be sufficient to avoid any material impairment risk in the near future. We
have historically financed acquisitions through a combination of borrowings, equity and excess cash
generated within the Group. We structure our acquisitions to include, from time to time, contingent and
deferred considerations that are included in the cost of the business combination at the fair value on the
date of the acquisitions. Apart from a number of earn-outs for which the remaining price to be paid by
us to sellers is currently estimated to be approximately €19.9 million if conditions precedent are reached,
we do not have any material financial or legal claims under the stock purchase agreements for the
acquisitions during the period under review. If the ABMI acquisition closes, an additional estimated
earn-out of €10.0 million may become payable if certain conditions precedents are reached. In addition,
under ABMI’s Put Option Agreement, we may be required to make certain payments up to an amount
of approximately €5.8 million if certain events occur, such as if we receive certain credits from the
French authorities.

We expect to continue to pursue smaller, margin-accretive, complementary bolt-on acquisitions, which
will become our Boutiques following the acquisitions, mainly in our existing markets, and we also
occasionally consider larger acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our investment criteria. We
will continue to focus on acquisitions of highly specialized businesses (such as IT, legal and finance),
business focusing on bottleneck jobs and engineering and consulting services, as well as new
geographic. We are also targeting, in particular, certain new end-markets such as healthcare and
pharmaceuticals and new geographic markets such as the Nordic countries and other countries, such as
Austria and Switzerland. For further discussion regarding our acquisitions strategy, please refer to
“Business—Our Strategies—Continue to target accretive acquisition opportunities to achieve
_European leadership.”_

**_Changes in Segment Reporting Beginning in 2021_**

We had historically structured our business across three segments: engineering and consulting,
specialized staffing and general staffing. In the first quarter of 2021, we integrated our legacy
specialized staffing and general staffing segments into the current specialized talent solutions segment,
and we have been presenting our results in two segments since then to reflect the integration.

This change in segment reporting better reflects our strategy towards becoming further specialized in
the human resources solutions market, as well as allows us to more clearly present our portfolio of
services to our client base.

Our financial information disclosed in this Offering Memorandum is presented under this new dual
segment structure for the periods under review. Our financial information for the specialized talent
solutions segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 represent the sum of the
results of the legacy specialized staffing and general staffing segments. As a result, such information
may not be directly comparable with the information included in our 2020 Financial Statements.

See note 6 to our 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

**_Our Interim Results Fluctuate as a result of Seasonality in our Business_**

Our revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations in many of the end-markets in which we operate. We
have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience, fluctuations in our results of
operations due to seasonal demand in our current end-markets. Seasonality means that our results vary


-----

from quarter to quarter, and therefore the results of one quarter may not be indicative of results for the
full year. Seasonality varies depending on a number of different factors and can impact our two staffing
segments differently. The underlying end-markets we serve are subject to various drivers that impact
overall end-market demand and therefore demand from our clients for staffing. For example, the
construction end-market may experience inclement weather on a worksite, which can decrease demand
for our job candidates. As a result of the mix of services we provide, seasonal work can also cause peaks
in demand during a specific period, such as around harvest time in the food production sector or around
holiday periods, such as the Christmas holidays, Easter and summer holidays, especially for the
businesses that are active in the event, hospitality and food sectors. Historically as a general matter, our
revenue fluctuates, with higher levels of revenue typically generated in the second quarter of the year,
then decreases during the summer holidays and increases again in the second half of the year beginning
just after the summer holidays, which then lasts for a sustained period before decreasing again in
December due to Christmas holidays. Due to this seasonality effect, we do not expect our Unaudited
Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to be reflective of the results we anticipate for
the full year to which they apply. The 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements were
additionally impacted by Covid-19, which impacted the traditional seasonality patterns experienced by
the Group with respect to revenue and working capital (with a number of governments granting
postponements to certain tax or other expenses and providing grants for certain unemployment support
that temporarily decreased the Group’s working capital needs) compared to previous years, though the
working capital dynamics of our business are such we are largely able to match payables with
receivables for job candidates at work at SMEs, which provides us with some counter cyclicality.

Moreover, we also experience seasonality with regard to our working capital requirements. We
generally experience larger working capital requirements in the first half of the year due to increased
holiday pay, bonus pay and tax payments. While our working capital requirements are generally lower
in the second half of the year, our working capital requirements also experience an increase at the end
of the year for end-of year bonuses and holiday pay, particularly as certain of our businesses institute
mandatory holidays at the end of the year.

For additional information see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our
_interim results fluctuate as a result of seasonality in our business.”_

**_Impact of Covid-19_**

Concomitant with its global and market-wide impact, Covid-19 and its subsequent new variants
negatively affected our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly in 2020. Our
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by 8.2% as compared to that for the year
ended December 31, 2019. See “Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations— Impact of Covid_19 and our Response” for further details on this impact. As a result, the comparability of our financial_
statements as of and for the year ended December 30, 2020 when compared to future periods may be
more limited.

**_Impact of the Transactions_**

The Acquisition was completed on November 3, 2022. See “Summary—The Transactions.”
Consequently, our consolidated financial information following the Transactions will not be fully
comparable with our historical consolidated financial information due to, among other things, (i) the
application of purchase accounting from the date of acquisition in connection with the Acquisition, (ii)
changes to depreciation and amortization expenses, among other things, that may result from the
purchase accounting of the Acquisition, (iii) additional interest expense associated with the financing
of the Transactions (after taking into account the refinancing of certain of our existing debt), (iv) the
acquisition by French Bidco of 70.8% of the share capital of Nowjobs France II SAS from a subsidiary
of House of HR and 100% of the share capital of ABY Engineering SAS, and the acquisition by ABY
Engineering SAS of 99.97% of the share capital of NewCo Abylsen SAS from a subsidiary of House
of HR and (v) changes to the level of consolidation of our results in the future. See “Presentation of

**Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations have been affected in the periods under review, and are expected to continue
to be affected, by various key factors relating to our business and industry, which we describe below.

**_General economic conditions_**

Economic and trading conditions in the countries in which we operate, or which we plan to enter, have
impacted our business in the past and will likely impact our business going forward in various ways.
While our business has historically generally been able to mitigate the fluctuations of the business cycle
due to a flexible cost structure, economic downturns can lead to a decrease in demand for our services.
Similarly, growth in national and international economies (i.e., GDP growth), particularly in the sectors
in which we specialize, can lead to increased demand for our services. Among our two business
segments, specialized talent solutions has historically, due to the temporary and flexible staffing
element in this segment, been more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which has led to decreases in
demand for such services in connection with economic downturns, but has often exhibited an early
resurgence after a recession as companies often reach for this resource as they invest in the growth of
their operations. Conversely, our engineering and consulting segment has historically been more
“defensive,” and as a result may show the effects of economic fluctuations less intensely and may take
longer after any economic downturn to recover. We have observed this same pattern in both 2020 and
2021, as the temporary and flexible staffing activities of the specialized talent segment had by the end
of 2020 returned to levels comparable to, and in 2021 surpassed, those seen in 2019, as measured by
weekly productive job candidates, outpacing the activity level of that for the engineering and consulting
segment during the same period. For most of our Boutiques, “productive job candidates” are defined as
job candidates working at the customer premises, expressed in full-time equivalents for the time they
are on client assignments.

The Covid-19 pandemic impacted the demand for our staffing services in 2020, and any resurgence of
Covid-19 or emergence of new variants or other pandemics could lead to potential future impact. At the
same time, there were a number of government initiatives introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic
that positively contributed to the Group’s ability to manage cash flows. A number of these measures,
however, ended in the course of 2021 or will end in the near future. Historically, following periods of
crisis the Group has demonstrated an ability to rebound, in part based on its decentralized structure,
allowing for flexible decision-making based on local needs and legislation, including revisions to
incentive-based structures to adapt to the changing environment. Management believes that the Group’s
strong geographical, segment and sector diversification has allowed it to smooth the impact and
recovery across the business as demonstrated by the positive EBITDA it recorded every month
throughout the Covid-19 crisis. Economic activities in our primary geographic markets normalized and
recovered to pre-Covid-19 levels in 2021 and this trend was carried into 2022. Despite the outbreak of
the new strain of Covid-19 virus Omicron in the last weeks of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022, we
are recording a higher number of productive job candidates at work each of the weeks in 2022 to date
as compared to 2019, 2020 and 2021.

The outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022 has caused an immediate impact on global
economic conditions, and the uncertain resolution of this conflict could result in protracted and severe
damage to the global economy. Although we do not have direct economic activities in Russia and
Ukraine, it is difficult to predict the scope and extent of any potential impacts the war could have on
our operations, especially given we source candidates from Eastern Europe. The war has also caused
supply shortage of, and therefore increased prices of, gas, energy and other raw materials, further
disrupted the global supply chain, which had already been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and
added to inflation, all of which are significantly impacting many companies, industries and sectors
directly and indirectly, resulting in us incurring increased operating costs and our clients reconsidering


-----

their recruitment efforts of domestic and foreign talents, which may, in turn, impact our results of
operations. Some customers, mainly those in Germany, have ended their requests for flexible staffing
solutions due to the shortage of goods or the challenges of exporting goods to Ukraine and Russia. At
the same time, the labor cost inflation as a result of the overall inflation is expected to lead to higher
costs of labor in relation to both our in-house employees and our people at work, which in turn will lead
to an increase in the Group’s operating costs, especially in Belgium where labor cost inflation is linked
to consumer price index increases. Such impact is not as significant to our specialized talent solutions
segment, as the cost of people at work within this segment can be passed through almost immediately
to the majority of our clients; however, this does not always apply to our engineering and consulting
segment as the contracts we enter into with our clients in this segment do not typically include automatic
wage pass-through provisions. Notwithstanding the above, we are generally able to pass through the
increased costs due to labor shortage and inflation to our clients.

In addition to these general trends, our results of operations have been impacted and we expect will
continue to be impacted by certain other key macroeconomic conditions, such as the changing
demographic mix as the number of people retiring outpaces the number of people entering the labor
force, unemployment rates and staffing penetration, in the geographic markets in which we operate.
Low unemployment rates often indicate a shortage of available workers in an economy, which can
increase the demand for our job candidates, whom we often recruit from other countries and
increasingly through our digital initiatives in an effort to establish a steady inflow. Furthermore,
increases in staffing penetration can indicate a greater prevalence or acceptance of temporary staffing
in an economy, which increases the market for our services. We generally operate in geographic markets
that are characterized by high average salaries, low unemployment and which are well developed and
mature in the temporary staffing and consulting fields. As a result of these trends, the demand for our
services has increased significantly over the last decade.

For further information relating to the outlook for the staffing solutions industry in our main
geographical markets, see “Industry and Market Data.”

Macroeconomic trends within each of our primary markets also contribute to the performance of our
operations in each of these countries:

_Belgium_

Data from the European Commission shows that annual real GDP growth in Belgium was 2.1%, (5.7)%
and 6.2% in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Belgium has also continued to experience a tightening
in the labor market as the population ages and there are fewer local workers to take the place of retirees.
Furthermore, Belgium has also been experiencing high employment rates due to employment
outgrowing the active population. Unemployment in Belgium has gone from 7.5% in 2007 to 6.4% in
2021, according to data from the World Bank. Staffing penetration has also increased in response to
this tightening of the labor market and decrease in unemployment. In the near term, while growth
saturation of employment will likely slow our growth in Belgium in the private sector, the opening of
certain public sector opportunities may offset this slowdown to a certain degree.

Management believes that the impact of potential client default is limited. As an illustration, the
historical rate of insolvencies (as a percentage of company stock) in Belgium from 2007 to 2016, based
on third party market data, has ranged between 0.5% to a maximum of 2.2% for small and medium
sized firms and below 0.5% for larger firms with over 250 employees, including during the financial
crisis of 2008-2009. Accordingly, bad debt provisions as a percentage of sales in Accent have ranged
steadily between 0% to 0.3% of sales, on an LTM basis, from 2017 through September 30, 2022.

_The Netherlands_

Data from the European Commission shows that annual real GDP growth was 2.0%, (3.8)% and 5.0%
in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively, in the Netherlands. As is the case elsewhere, GDP growth in the


-----

Netherlands affects us primarily through its effect on the end-markets in which our clients operate. Our
engineering and consulting and specialized staffing segments in the Netherlands are affected by growth
in the construction and engineering markets, which in turn are driven by overall domestic economic
growth. Long-term demographic and economic trends are also driving a demand for construction
workers. After a downturn from 2009 until 2012, the Dutch construction end-market has been growing
significantly due in part to general economic resurgence, low interest rates, as well an increase in
environmentally-focused project or larger infrastructure projects. These trends contribute to demand for
job candidates with specialties and skills that operate in the construction end-market.

The Netherlands also has a number of jobs that are driven by regulatory developments in addition to
GDP fluctuations. For example, demand for job candidates in the financial services sector is impacted
by the growth in financial regulation. This impacts demand for our services, due to the fact that, within
our engineering and consulting segment, our Powerhouse Redmore provides job candidates with
technical, specialized skills to the financial sector. This also happens in the public and government
sector, an end-market that our Powerhouse Cohedron addresses.

The Netherlands, similarly to Belgium, has historically had low unemployment rates which impacts our
business positively. Between 2007 and 2014, the unemployment rate in the Netherlands rose from 4.2%
to 7.4%, but then decreased to 4.0% in 2021 (according to data from the World Bank). This low
unemployment rate has led to fewer local individuals going into the strenuous working conditions of
the logistics workforce, which has supported demand for our job candidates, including our foreign job
candidates, who have experience in this sector and can meet demand for such jobs.

_Germany_

Data from the European Commission shows that annual real GDP growth in Germany was 1.1%, (4.6)%
and 2.9% in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In Germany, our general staffing activity is GDPsensitive and exposes us more directly to fluctuations in GDP and economic change. As GDP slows,
market value grows at a slower pace and the number of hours worked by an individual decreases. Lowskilled, mainly blue-collar workers are, however, in structural shortage in Germany, which provides
opportunities for our services.

Unemployment in Germany between 2007 and 2021 fell from 8.7% to 3.5% (according to data from
the World Bank). Companies are, therefore, expected to continue to address staff shortages through
temporary staffing. Moreover, we believe that generally lower-skilled workers do not travel as much,
which can lead to significantly localized shortages in demand. Some companies, including ours,
overcome this barrier through sourcing in Eastern Europe where lower skilled workers are willing to
travel. Decreasing unemployment and shortages of low-skilled blue-collar workers has driven an
increased reliance on temp workers leading to an increase in demand for our services.

Finally, the staffing industry specifically was impacted by certain German regulatory reforms, including
the Act on Staffing (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz) (“AÜG”), which has been substantially amended
over the years, most recently in 2017. The focus of the 2017 amendment was to strengthen permanent
employment; as a result, a maximum period for temporary staffing has been introduced and formal
requirements have been tightened up as has the equal pay principle. Providing staffing services in the
construction industry in Germany is also generally prohibited by law, although it is possible for a
staffing solutions provider who is active in the construction industry to obtain a specific permit.
Additionally, beginning in 2021 the German government has generally forbidden staffing companies to
work in the meat industry as a result of the sanitary crisis in 2020. See “—Changes in regulation—
_Temporary Employment Regulations.”_

_France_

Data from the European Commission shows that annual real GDP growth in France was 1.8%, (7.9)%
and 7.0% in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In France, we only provide engineering consulting


-----

under our engineering and consulting segment, which has historically been insulated to a significant
degree from GDP fluctuations.

The unemployment rate in France has increased from 7.7% to 8.1% between 2007 and 2021 (according
to data from the World Bank), which is higher than the other countries in which we work. As we operate
in a specialized sector in France, the structurally high unemployment in France, however, has not
impacted demand for our services in a material manner, nor do we expect it to do so in the future.

_Brexit_

On January 1, 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement entered into force provisionally and
entered into force on May 1, 2021. Despite the implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation
Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how the agreement will affect relations between
the United Kingdom and the European Union. Significant political and economic uncertainty remains
about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially in practice from the terms before
withdrawal. Lack of clarity about future laws and regulations in the United Kingdom as the United
Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate could depress economic
activity and restrict our access to capital. The economic outlook could be further adversely affected by:
(i) the risk arising from changes in laws and regulations in the U.K.; (ii) the risk that movements in the
pound sterling exchange rates related to Brexit could damage competitiveness or profitability; (iii) the
risk that goods moving between the U.K. and any member of the EU will be subject to duties and tariffs;
and (iv) the risk that goods moving between the U.K. and any member of the EU will be subject to
additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and
departure.

As the U.K. represents a key export market for several of the countries in which we operate, particularly
Belgium and the Netherlands, adverse trade terms between the U.K. and the countries in which we
operate could have an adverse effect on the economies of these countries, which could by extension
adversely affect our business.

Furthermore, Brexit has limited the ability of individuals from various foreign countries to work in the
U.K., which increased the supply of job candidates in several of the countries in which we operate, but
we believe that this trend has not significantly impacted our Gross Margin.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our results of operations could be
_materially adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions.”_

**_Changes in regulation_**

While the markets in which we operate tend to be fairly stable from a legal and regulatory perspective,
from time to time there are changes that may impact the performance of our business. Our industry is
extensively regulated by regulatory authorities in each of the countries in which we operate and at an
EU level. These regulations impact how we structure our employment agreements with job candidates
and our service agreements with clients. See “Regulation.” During the period under review, certain
changes in the regulatory frameworks, particularly the new legislations on payroll that took effect in the
Netherlands from January 1, 2020 which, among other things, mandated that payroll employees are
entitled to all terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions, impacted our results
of operations.

_Temporary Employment Regulation_

Regulations around temporary employment can impact the clients and opportunities that are available
to us. For example, as from the 2017 to 2018 period, the Belgian region of Flanders and the Belgian
federal government authorized temporary employment in the public sector for periods of up to twelve
months, which has provided additional opportunities to place temporary employees within these sectors.
While this practice is still not permitted in the Belgian region of Wallonia, if in the future and to the


-----

extent that this region adopts a similar policy, it could further increase our ability to provide our services
in that region.

Moreover, regulations can affect the duration of our services. In Germany, since the last reform of the
AÜG in April 2017, the assignment period of temporary workers was limited to 18 months (with
exceptions) after which the employee either needs to be let go from the company where they were
working or accepted on to the general payroll of that company. As a result, as our job candidates
approach the end of their assignment period they will either need to be replaced, which can be difficult
during times of scarcity of qualified job candidates, or are taken over by the client resulting in lower
volumes for us. Furthermore, wages and benefits of temporary workers are aligned to those of the
employees of the company after nine months of uninterrupted assignment (through the “EqualPay”
mechanism), but must be paid by the staffing solutions provider, which increases the administrative
burden on us. In addition, beginning in 2021 the German government has generally forbidden staffing
companies to work in the meat industry as a result of the sanitary crisis in 2020.

In the Netherlands, there have been low-wage benefits regulations (“LIV”) which create subsidies for
the employment of low-wage workers since January 2017. This law is aimed at incentivizing employers
to hire employees who have a vulnerable position in the labor market. A review of these incentives,
however, resulted in cuts to the maximum compensation to the normal LIV in 2020, which resulted in
lower subsidies obtained in 2020 as compared to prior years, especially in Covebo, despite comparable
turnover. In November 2022, this law was further revised and it was decided that, only for 2022, the
LIV benefit for 2022 will be increased retroactively, while the LIV benefit for 2023 will be remain at
the normal level and the LIV benefit for 2024 will be reduced. If the planned pension reform goes ahead
in 2025, the LIV will end in 2024. Moreover, under the Wet Aanpak Schijnconstructies (“WAS”)
regulation, cost related to workers, can be withheld from workers’ wages only if the wage remains
above net minimum wage (since January 2016). However, deductions are still allowed below minimum
wage for pension and healthcare insurance. All other deductions are not allowed if the net salary then
becomes below minimum wage. For these non-deducted costs, we send invoices to the workers. If
workers do not pay their invoices and return to their country of origin, we are left with the costs. This
regulation has no impact for the clients.

Significant Dutch law changes came into effect with respect to temporary agency work and payrolling,
among others. From January 1, 2020, the Balanced Labor Market Act (Wet Arbeidsmarkt in balans)
(“WAB”) came into effect. For example, there will be increased social security charges for temporary
staffing agencies in their capacity as employer. Furthermore, payroll employees will be entitled to all
terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions. These regulations came into effect
in 2020 and our cost of services has increased, but simultaneously also our sales prices increased. We
currently see that we have been able to pass on the majority of these increases in costs to our clients
through higher fees charged for our services.

Furthermore, new legislation has come into effect requiring employment housing to remain available
for four weeks following the end of employment of foreign workers. Currently, the majority of foreign
workers leave employment housing immediately following the end of their employment, or during the
weekend thereafter. Foreign workers that do remain in employment housing are required to pay weekly
rent, and we send them weekly invoices. There is increasing attention in the Netherlands on separation
between employment providers and housing providers. While this separation is not currently legally
required, our Covebo Powerhouse has already implemented relevant measures to address it. We expect
a contractual separation will be enforced in the future; however, there is currently no clear indication as
to the extent of what the required separation will be, and we cannot be certain at this time whether a
complete separation, or a full ban on the provision of housing to temporary workers by employment
agencies, will be legally required in the future.

For a further discussion of the regulatory framework in which we conduct our business in our principal
geographic end-markets, see “Regulation.”


-----

_Tax Regulation_

Changes in tax law can impact our current and future tax liabilities, and can also lead to reversals of
certain deferred tax income balances. For example, the Belgian Corporate Income Tax regime has been
modified by the Belgian Government by means of the Corporate Income Tax Reform Act of December
25, 2017 (Official Gazette of December 29, 2017). As a result of the reform, we remeasured our deferred
income tax balances. Deferred income tax expected to be reversed in the year to December 31, 2021
and December 31, 2020 has been measured using the effective rate that will apply in Belgium for the
period (29.58%). Deferred income tax expected to be reversed beyond December 31, 2021 has been
measured with an effective rate of 25%.

Further, the Dutch corporate income tax rates and brackets have been modified. As of January 1, 2022,
the Netherlands levies Dutch corporate income tax at a rate of 15% with respect to taxable profits up to
€395,000 and 25.8% with respect to taxable profits in excess of that amount.

_Financial regulation_

While regulations on banking, insurance and the financial industry as a whole only have an indirect
material effect on our business, recent regulatory developments in the financial industry between 2016
and 2019, including the updates to the financial supervision amendment Act, the Packaged Retail and
Insurance-based Investment Products regulation, the Capital Markets Union, the International Financial
Reporting Standards, final documents on the Reform of Basel III (“Basel IV”), Customer DD/Know
your Customer regulations, the Uniform Calculation Method-Uniform pension calculation, and the new
EU Directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision
(“IORP II”), have created a heightened need for specialized employees, which can create additional
demand for our job candidates who focus on compliance and legal matters in the financial industry.

_ESG Regulation_

On April 21, 2021, the European Commission adopted a proposal for the CSRD, which would amend
the existing reporting requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and encourage corporate
spending towards sustainable activities across the EU. The European Council approved the CSRD on
November 28, 2022 and the application of the regulation is expected to take place in four stages, the
first of which will require companies that already fall under the CSRD to complete their first CSRD
reporting on the financial year 2024, with expected reporting deadlines in 2025. We expect that we will
be required to comply with the CSRD. We cannot guarantee how the CSRD will impact our governance
structure and our day-to-day business activities. We have a formalized ESG charter to guide us on
achieving our targeted ESG KPIs and complying with relevant ESG regulations. See “Business—
_Environmental, Social and Governance” for information on our ESG initiatives._

**_Drivers of sales and pricing_**

_Organic Growth_

In addition to the sales growth created through the acquisitions discussed above (see “—Factors
_Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Acquisitions, Disposals and the_
_Comparability of our Financial Statements”), our sales are impacted by the Organic Growth of our_
business. We measure Organic Growth by analyzing revenue growth between one financial period and
the comparable prior period, excluding the impact of acquisitions on revenue as follows:

- in respect of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (compared against the nine
months ended September 30, 2021), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue
by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2021;


-----

- in respect of revenue for 2021 (compared against 2020), we have excluded the impact of
acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2020;
and

- in respect of revenue for 2020 (compared against 2019), we have excluded the impact of
acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019
or that divestments have taken place as of January 1, 2019.

The key drivers of the Organic Growth of our business are:

- increasing our geographic footprint by opening new branches with our “cell division” approach;

- continuing our growth in stronghold sectors and niches;

- winning new contracts with clients;

- expanding our work with existing clients;

- sourcing additional job candidates that can fill scarce assignments held by our clients;

- increasing candidate sourcing through international recruitment;

- digitalization;

- expanding into new business lines; and

- pricing growth.

We seek to minimize the financial risk of new offices by focusing on securing new sales in a geographic
region before committing to additional costs of a new office there. Historically, we have successfully
hired additional sales employees onto our payroll to win new contracts with clients; our Powerhouse
Continu Professionals has notably employed this approach successfully. Furthermore, our business
integration in Germany and the expansion of our business through the opening of new branches of our
existing Powerhouses in 2022 have accelerated our Organic Growth. When doing bolt-on acquisitions
in new but matching sectors, we have successfully expanded these services to existing branches, as
proven by Continu Professionals with the acquisition of mténv.

Moreover, our Organic Growth is impacted by our ability to improve the utilization of job candidates
and reduce our bench time, see “—Gross Margin—Bench time/Utilization,” increasing our sales in time
and material contracts over any given period.

Our ability to expand our business geographically by opening offices in new locations also functions as
an incentive to reward employees who have demonstrated strong results and initiative and would be
well-suited to lead new offices. We typically open new offices when we receive a significant number
of requests from existing clients or prospective clients to provide services in new locations or when we
see increasing demand for our services coming from a specific region. Expansion through opening new
offices has positively impacted and is expected to continue to impact our operating profits.

_Staffing volume_

The key drivers of staffing volume in any given market are the macro-economic and sector specific
growth, and the labor tightness, see “—General economic conditions” discussed above and the
regulatory environment, see “—Changes in regulation” above.

**_Pricing_**


-----

The substantial majority of our service agreements are structured to give us the ability to pass-through
wage increases from inflation to customers in both of our segments. See “Business—Our Strengths—
_Ability to pass through wage increases to customers, including through automatic contractual_
_mechanisms, and stable margins.”_

In the specialized talent solutions segment, which accounted for 46.5% of our Pro Forma Management
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022, price increases are automatically passed through to our clients. For this segment,
our contract model is centered on matching the length of our candidate’s employment contract with us
to the length of our placement contract with our client, the ultimate employer, in order to limit bench
time risk and prevent lag time between inflation of gross salary paid to the candidate and the cost we
charge to our clients, which results in an automatic pass-through of any salary increases. Under these
types of contracts, the utilization risk of the job candidates in between contracts is reduced. In Germany,
temporary workers are, however, required to be on the temporary employment company’s payroll,
which creates bench time risk for us with regard to our temporary job candidates in our specialized
talent solutions segment. In many cases, bench time is limited, as temporary workers’ contracts can
usually be terminated in, on average, two weeks’ notice given during the time of the job candidate’s
last assignment, unless we decide to retain them. At the end of our contracts, we renegotiate them, which
has historically resulted in an ability to increase our prices in line with wage inflation. Our revenues
typically correlate with nominal GDP rather than real GDP due to our stables margins and ability to
pass through wage increases in an inflationary environment. We base our contract pricing on a
candidate’s gross salary multiplied by a coefficient factor, with the split typically being transparent to
the client. The key pricing drivers for the coefficient factor are the scarcity of candidates and the value
of any additional services we offer. Key costs for us include salaries and work accident insurance. At
the end of the contract period, typically one week or one month in length, if the salary increases, then
we charge the cost of the higher salary to the client. In the specialized talent solutions segment,
regulations in Belgium and the Netherlands require that job candidates through our services are paid
the same as local or company-sourced workers, while this applies in Germany only after a job candidate
has worked for the employer for a certain period of time. The following chart illustrates our revenue
per billed hour for the specialized talent solutions segment.

In our engineering and consulting segment, which accounted for 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with clients. The
contracts are typically time and material contracts, which means we are compensated for the time that
our job candidates spend with a client on assignment, and have no obligations for any specific result.
Most of our candidates in our engineering and consulting segment are permanently hired by us on
employment contracts that typically have three- to six-week notice periods and we have placement
contracts with our clients that typically last nine to twelve months, which allows us to effectively
manage bench time and match our candidates with the upcoming mandates from clients. In most cases,
we plan for salary increases in advance and negotiate rate increases with our clients accordingly. Our
pricing model in our engineering and consulting segment centers on charging the client an hourly or


-----

daily rate. Our billing rate is typically based on an hourly wage and a mark-up where the split is usually
not transparent to clients. Key drivers of the hourly or daily rates are skills, seniority and scarcity of
candidates. Our key costs include salary, potentially including a company car. At the end of a placement
contract, renewal either entails replacing the candidate with a new or more junior person at a new price
or by placing the same candidate, at a more senior level with a higher salary. Margin growth in our
engineering and consulting segment is driven by increasing the cost per hour paid and billed. The hourly
and daily pricing model for engineering and consulting positions generally produces higher Gross
Margins than factor pricing based on the job candidates’ gross salaries. In our engineering and
consulting segment, there is a higher risk of bench time than in our specialized talent solutions segment,
as a result of our job candidates being on our payroll but not being used on a paid job assignment. As
their employer, we are still responsible for their costs even if they are not generating money for our
operations. To mitigate the bench time risk, we carefully monitor our job candidates that are our
employees with indefinite term contracts and seek to minimize their bench time by lining up
assignments to transition to once a current one is complete, or by terminating employment agreements
as appropriate should transition to another assignment be not feasible or desirable. The following chart
illustrates our revenue per billed hour for the engineering and consulting segment.

We also perform a limited amount of work under search and selection contracts in both of our business
segments through our Accent (through the Ctrl-F brand), Redmore (through the Ctrl-F brand),
TIMEPARTNER, Continu Professionals, Covebo, GRITT and TMI Powerhouses. This can be done
either by the Powerhouses themselves or through one of their Boutiques. Unlike for other types of
contracts, the full amount of the commissions typically remains with us as it is not subject to cost of
services or other deductions. In such arrangements, we do not benefit from a share of the on-going
revenue during the duration of the employment as we do in other contracts.

We also perform certain amount of work placing freelancers. In the case of freelancers, rather than
receiving a salary from us, the freelancers submit invoices to us for the services they have provided to
the relevant client. Freelancers produce smaller Gross Margins for us as they are generally more
experienced and are therefore more expensive to hire, but this is partially compensated by the fact that
freelancers present no bench risk for us.

**_Competition_**

Our results of operations are impacted by the levels of competition that we experience in each of the
markets in which we operate and in any new markets that we may enter. We compete with other firms
offering HR solutions to both clients and job candidates to varying degrees in each of the geographical
markets and staffing segments in which we operate. Competition for both of these groups is based on a
variety of factors, and such competition has intensified following the Covid-19 pandemic due to the
general labor shortage. Competitive factors in obtaining and retaining clients can include the ability to
find job candidates with the appropriate skills and/or experience, brand awareness, quality, speed of
client service, proximity to the client and particularly in relation to temporary staffing services, and
price. Competitive factors in obtaining and retaining job candidates can include wages, quality of
engagement, number of hours of work available, responsiveness to work schedules, job content and
type of project, personal validation of the job candidates and brand image.


-----

On large contracts, which are more common in temporary staffing services under our specialized talent
solutions segment, there is often pressure on pricing due to the increased competitiveness in the
industry. There is often less pricing pressure in our engineering and consulting segment, due to the
scarcity of candidates to fill certain roles. As a result, this segment and the higher margins associated
with these fields are becoming increasingly attractive to firms in the industry.

In certain of our key geographic markets, such as the Netherlands, the specialized HR solutions market
is relatively mature with comparatively established pricing. Across all four of our key geographic
markets the industry is fragmented. In individual markets and specialist sectors, we compete with
smaller, more localized or more specialized firms. As a result of the trend towards consolidation in the
specialized HR solutions industry, we also compete with larger full-service and specialized competitors
in the international, national, regional and local markets. In addition, some current and prospective
clients, particularly among larger corporates, may elect not to fill their staffing requirements from
outside sources, and may instead hire independent contractors directly on a temporary basis or provide
similar services internally. Many clients use more than one staffing services provider, and the majority
of client relationships are non-exclusive.

Websites, search engines and online job boards, such as Google for Jobs, monsterboard.nl and Indeed
are improving their matching capabilities, potentially affecting part of our business. Pricing,
promotional and marketing actions of our competitors may also impact our business, such that our price
levels could be impacted or that we need to invest more in marketing and advertising to obtain the right
candidates.

For a further discussion of our competitors in each of our divisions, see “Industry and Market Data.”

**_Cost of Services, Selling Expenses and Other Expenses_**

The following table presents our cost of services, selling expenses and other general and administrative
expenses for the periods indicated, as well as the percentage of revenue they comprised in each
respective period. These costs and expenses represented our most significant operating costs and
expenses during the period under review and are expected to continue to be our primary ones in the
future.

_Cost of Services_

Cost of services comprises costs directly attributable to revenue, which mainly relate to costs associated
with our job candidates, such as their wages and salaries, social security charges, training costs, other
benefits (including housing expenses, car leases, mobility costs, vouchers for meals and other
incentives, such as reimbursements to job candidates for utilizing environmentally friendly
transportation solutions as well as other benefits for job candidates), and costs associated with
freelancers. A small portion of these costs relates to material costs for projects performed in GRITT
Projects, which was divested in 2020. Our job candidates’ wages and salaries, social security and other
benefits amounted to our largest cost of services during the period under review. The principal factor
that affects these costs is the number of job candidates that we employ. As a result, these costs increase


-----

as we add additional job candidates either through growing our business organically or through
acquisitions. Our overall number of job candidates, however, may not be representative of our expected
cost of services since these costs will be impacted by the level of compensation each job candidate
receives, which is in turn linked to inflation, specializations, qualifications and positions filled by each
job candidate.

During the period of Covid-19, which had a particularly severe impact on the global economy in 2020,
attracting foreign nationals entailed additional costs, given restrictions on crossing borders and
additional quarantine measures and isolation requirements which led to increased numbers of days of
unproductivity, with the result of increased housing expenses, hygienic and sanitary costs and provision
of groceries for candidates arriving from abroad. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cost of
services decreased by 7.8%, from €1,288.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,188.2
million. This was in parallel with an 8.2% decrease in revenue during the same period, from €1,738.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,596.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2020. This illustrates the largely variable nature of our cost base, as Accent, Continu Professionals and
Covebo mainly employ workers whose contracts can be terminated immediately, or who can be put on
the bench without cost, as well as freelancers. For workers with less flexible conditions, typically
because they are on our payroll with an indefinite term contract, such as the specialists employed by
GRITT, Abylsen and TIMEPARTNER (including AERO and IBB) under permanent contracts and
whose costs of services are therefore semi-variable, we were able to rely on economic unemployment
measures to decrease the related costs. In some cases, even when companies could terminate contracts
immediately, they chose not to do so and instead opted to rely on certain government economic
unemployment initiatives so they could scale up quickly when the Covid-19 restrictive measures eased.
These companies also employ freelancers, for whom costs are fully variable. Such additional costs
reduced in 2021 as lockdown measures eased, which consequentially also led to a higher level of
staffing activities compared to 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our cost of services
increased by 26.6%, from €1,188.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €1,504.3 million.
This was in parallel with a 28.4% increase in revenue during the same period, from €1,596.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €2,050.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Given the nature of our operations, which typically results in us placing our job candidates on our
payroll while they are on assignment, we are required to insure a significant number of persons against
work accidents, which impacts our cost of services. Since 2021, a variable premium rate has been
applied to our work accident insurance, with a base premium rate of 2.918%, a mid-case rate of 3.064%
and worst-case rate of 3.097%, depending on the number of work accidents we have. This premium is
calculated based on the gross salary mass of our temporary workers. Such cost will be partly offset by
customer compensations and efforts to lower accident occurrence and further offset by other cost
reductions, following efficiencies realized in other departmental costs within Accent.

Ransomware and other cyber risks have increased in general during Covid-19 and also require us to
invest in a higher standard of back-up procedures as work from home and remote working practices
predominate, especially in relation to compliance with data protection laws, avoidance of
misappropriation and cyber theft, leading to higher operating costs for our information technologies, as
additional work, licenses and expertise is needed to detect and prevent adverse occurrences. This also
increased our cost of services since 2020.

_Gross Margin_

Our Gross Margin represents our gross profit (our revenue less our cost of services) divided by our
revenue. Our Gross Margin was 25.9%, 25.6% and 26.6% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020
and 2021, and 26.0% and 26.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

There are two primary drivers of our Gross Margin: the bill-pay spread and the bench time/utilization
of our job candidates (particularly our job candidates in our engineering and consulting segment):


-----

- _Bill-pay spread: We will typically enter into an employment agreement with the job candidate_
(often for the duration of an assignment or longer in the case of certain business units) and we
will enter into a placement contract or project contract with the client. We then bill the client
for the services performed by the job candidate who are on time and material contracts and pay
the salary of the job candidate. The percentage difference between what we bill our clients and
what we pay as salary to the job candidates is referred to as the “bill-pay spread” and it is the
key driver of our profitability.

- _Bench time/Utilization: Job candidates in most of our engineering and consulting business units_
as well as our job candidates in Germany are our permanent employees on our payroll whether
or not they are on assignment with a client. As a result, our engineering and consulting segment
in particular carefully monitors the end date of all job candidates’ assignments and aims to line
up the next assignment before their current ones come to an end. This monitoring seeks to
minimize “bench time,” which is the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed
to a client assignment. Our bench time for 2021 was approximately 0.3%. By minimizing a job
candidate’s bench time, we aim to ensure the job candidate is being utilized on a project that
requires his or her skill set, so there is a match between what we bill the client for the job
candidate’s services and what we pay the job candidate. New assignments also ensure future
career development of the job candidate. Furthermore, the impact of utilization upon our Gross
Margin will also depend on the mix of job candidates whose utilization is impacted, with the
more specialized job candidates typically performing work under contracts with higher bill-pay
spreads as a result of their scarcity and specialization. As most of our contracts are on a time
and materials basis, increased utilization rates will typically improve our Gross Margin.

The Covid-19 pandemic has presented an additional impact on our Gross Margin as a result of various
local government measures providing partial compensation for temporary unemployment, such as
furlough schemes. In certain cases, for example in France, we retained job candidates on our payroll
but the government measures did not provide full compensation for such candidates; therefore, the
company responsible for the candidate still had to pay a portion of the compensation. In addition, in
certain cases we also retained job candidates on our payroll in order to accommodate our customers
more quickly when the isolation measures were over, without having to wait for additional hires. For
some companies that typically have higher bench time, we saw a reduction in their bench time as a
result of placing job candidates on government economic unemployment initiatives.

Due to the difference in Gross Margin between our various segments, our segment mix, and within each
segment, our industry, sector or candidate mix can affect our overall Gross Margin. For example, in
Accent, the construction end-market generates a higher Gross Margin than the hospitality end-market,
and student candidates generate a lower Gross Margin compared to the experienced candidates. Below
is the revenue split between our two business segments for the years ending December 31, 2019, 2020
and 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022.

-----

Additionally, the difference in Gross Margin between various types of contracts can also affect our
overall Gross Margin. For example, our search and selection services are based on commissions earned
for job candidates sourced for clients. We receive less revenue from such services because we only
locate the candidate and then receive a search and selection commission, rather than a contract with the
client that also includes such job candidate’s wages or salary, social security and other benefits to be
paid out and administered by us. Such contracts tend to provide a higher Gross Margin of approximately
100% since there are no subsequent costs to deduct from the commissions received.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling expenses comprise the wages and salaries (including variable pay), social security charges and
other benefits (such as accommodation expenses) for in-house employees responsible for operational
activities at our branches, as well as advertising and marketing (including internal marketing),
amortization of customer relationships and brand names that were originally valued in the context of
various business combinations and other selling expenses. Selling expenses are primarily impacted by
the number of in-house employees we employ. As a result, selling expenses will increase when we grow
our operations and the number of in-house employees that we have who manage the recruiting lifecycle
and oversee the sourcing, selection and placement of our job candidates on assignment. In 2020, the
Covid-19 pandemic also resulted in an increase in such selling expenses. In particular, in Accent we
paid a one-time additional bonus to members of our commercial team during the second and third
quarters of 2020, in recognition of extraordinary continuing contributions during the Covid-19 period.
As the impact of Covid-19 lessened in 2021, selling expenses increased primarily in correspondence
with revenue.

_Other general and administrative expenses_

Other general and administrative expenses comprise personnel and accommodation expenses of head
offices, IT expenses, depreciation expenses largely relating to charges on capitalized buildings, cars and
software, and other general and administrative expenses at the headquarters level, as well as share-based
payments. During the period under review, our share-based payments consisted of several ratchet
schemes offered to key management at different acquired Powerhouses (Abylsen, Covebo, Continu
Professional, TIMEPARTNER and GRITT) (“ratchet schemes”) and our former long-term incentive
plan at the level of shareholders of House of HR (“long-term incentive plan”), which we settled in
connection with the Acquisition. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, we recognized €4.6 million, €3.9 million and
€1.5 million, respectively, in share-based payments connected to option grants made under our longterm incentive plan launched in 2018. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized
€3.7 million in share-based payments connected to option grants made under the same long-term
incentive plan. See note 19 to each of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 21 to
our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information. On the Acquisition Closing Date, we established the structure
for a management equity participation program pursuant to which certain managers of the Group are
able to acquire, subscribe for or otherwise receive MIP Securities. See “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions—Management Incentive Plan.”_

**_Impact of Covid-19 and our Response_**

Concomitant with its global and market-wide impact, the Covid-19 pandemic negatively affected our
business, results of operations and financial condition in 2020. Our revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2020, decreased by 8.2%, from €1,738.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
to €1,596.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of Covid-19.

In response to this unprecedented situation, we modified certain of our operational practices and
changed how we communicate both internally and with customers; we implemented additional
protective procedures; and we accessed temporary government measures that were advantageous to us.


-----

In respect of sales in our markets, our response included keeping branches open to the extent possible,
such that the large majority of our branch network continues to exist post-lockdowns, as management
sought to preserve stability in terms of access to customers. Temporary Unemployment measures were
utilized in order to retain experienced and trained staff members, while we undertook various initiatives
and loyalty programs for staff of platforms and operating companies, including motivational training.
We also awarded special bonuses in respect of extraordinary efforts with new customers, and for
boosting sales in the initial months after the first lock-down. In particular, in Accent, special regional
growth bonuses, which were structured to allow for increased collaboration on a region-wide basis, and
speed bonuses, for those offices that were the first to return to financial performance in line with 2019
figures, were awarded.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we managed our costs of services, where possible, by placing
consultants or temporary workers on temporary unemployment or similar schemes (depending on
available government assistance in each of our markets) in order to keep our workforce intact to the
extent possible, so as to be able to place these candidates back on customer assignment once customers
resumed hiring. In Continu Professionals, consultants were also kept on the payroll, and were kept on
the bench so as to allow them to return to work after the virus’s first wave. This approach paid off during
the summer, when the large majority of people on the bench were back at work with a customer.

We also reduced expenses by placing internal staff on temporary unemployment where we deemed
appropriate, such as in branches that were inactive because the sector had closed (such as the retail nonfood and hotel, retail and café (“horeca”) segments). In Accent, we placed internal staff on temporary
unemployment on March 18, 2020, the first day this was allowed by the authorities. In Abylsen, internal
staff were not put on temporary unemployment, thereby permitting them to remain close to those
consultants that were still at the customer, allowing us to continue to detect further opportunities with
those customers that were still active during the first lock-down.

We reduced marketing expenses and other expenses to the minimum required in 2020, while retooling
in an effort to draw interest, such as webinars we organized for customers to explain the impact of
government measures. Management also reduced capital expenditures compared to recent prior years
in order to protect cash levels during the Covid-19 pandemic and as a precautionary measure also drew
on its Existing Revolving Credit Facility in March 2020, which was subsequently repaid in June 2020.

Our sales fully recovered during 2021, achieving above pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels, mostly due to
the economic recovery and the overall digitalization trends that are expected to continue going forward.
With global economy having been revived in 2021, there is a talent crunch as companies are looking to
fill positions that were cut in 2020 due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, the Covid19 pandemic has led to many job candidates re-evaluating their careers, work conditions and long-term
professional goals, resulting in an increased rate of employees switching jobs and transitioning between
different job modes. This has led employers to focus more intensely than ever on employee retention
and job mobility, which has created substantial opportunities for us to offer our services.

In response to the evolving market trends, we are increasingly more focused on the bottleneck
professions and specialized jobs, and our M&A strategy is strengthening our capability to capitalize on
such trends. For example, our acquisitions of TMI and Cohedron helped us to expand and compete in
the healthcare and public sectors. Also, Accent partnered with a regional public employment service,
the VDAB (the Flemish Institution for Employment Mediation and Training), to participate in
CareerFlow, a government-initiated project in Belgium that facilitates job mobility between employers
and provides alternatives to employees. Through this project, employees can temporarily or
permanently work for different employers, which allows them to develop skill sets that would best
match their professional goals. This creates a benefit for both employers and job candidates, as
employers have a larger and more diverse talent pool to tap into for their various staffing needs, while
job candidates have a better chance to stay employed and more flexibility in shaping their careers.


-----

Although the spread of the new strain of Covid-19, Omicron, in the last weeks of 2021 and at the
beginning of 2022 did not visibly impact our recovery in terms of sales, increased sickness and isolation
measures did put pressure on our Gross Margin. Furthermore, we are navigating a new market landscape
as the expectations and preferences of employers and job candidates have changed drastically during
the Covid-19 pandemic. There is no clear indication whether there will be an ongoing resurgence in the
spread of Covid-19 in our primary markets in the future, and together with the war in Ukraine, we are
experiencing increased costs of labor, services and raw materials as a result of inflation and are facing
the prospect of another recession. We generally have the ability to, however, pass through wage
increases from inflation to customers in both our engineering and consulting segment and our
specialized talent solutions segment, which, coupled with our flexible cost structure, has resulted in
resilient Gross Margins. Our revenues typically correlate with nominal GDP rather than real GDP due
to our stable margins and ability to pass through wage increases in an inflationary environment.

**Staffing Solutions Industry Trends**

In addition to the key factors above, there are also certain trends that could play a significant role in our
results of operations in the future as these trends become more prevalent or as our operations in such
areas develop and grow. See also “Industry—Staffing Solutions Secular Industry Drivers.” These
include: aging population; technological changes; career mobility and the need to reskill; diversity,
inclusion and corporate social responsibility; increased premium on quality of life; and outsourcing and
offshoring.

**_Aging populations_**

As the population of our target markets ages and workers exit the labor pool, there has been an increase
in competition among employers to fill the gaps left behind. This has left an opening for staffing
intermediaries, especially those like us that have a proven track record of identifying and matching the
right candidates to the right jobs, to fill these vacant positions with qualified talent. Additionally, a
scarcity of talent for certain roles is driving wages up, which in turn can increase the pricing power of
staffing firms for the solutions and staffing we provide.

**_Technological changes_**

In recent years, candidates are increasingly turning to online job boards when seeking out a position,
particularly through traffic generated by mobile devices. At the same time, clients expect more efficient
services at a lower cost that can only be delivered through the use of digital tools. We have also seen
an increase in the number of passive job seekers who apply through targeted advertisements on social
media when they were not actively searching for a position at the time. The market has also experienced
the development of new platforms, such as Uber Works in the United States, which however announced
in May 2020 the closure of their operations in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to their official
press release. Such platforms may be considered competitors, since they sometimes are able to attract
people directly to be employed for them via freelance or independent status. Nevertheless, such
platforms lack a human touch in the services they provide, and authorities in different countries monitor
fair treatment of workers by these platforms and are looking to ensure that there is no unfair competition
with other forms of labor. Such monitoring is especially common in the EU, where regulation and labor
unions are stronger than in other countries.

**_Career mobility and the need to re-skill_**

Millennial workers, especially highly skilled ones, are increasingly mobile and seeking a varied career
path, driving the need for re-skilling. This re-skilling can be provided through both formal and on-thejob training that is typically provided as part of temporary work agreements.

**_Diversity, inclusion and corporate social responsibility_**


-----

As the diversity trend becomes mainstream across clients, service providers have an opportunity to
provide increasing value to their clients by tapping into broad, international pools of candidates.

**_Increased premium on quality of life_**

It is increasingly difficult to find qualified candidates to fill some roles that offer long hours and difficult
conditions, as younger generations of workers are placing a fairly large premium on happiness in their
personal and professional lives. This has contributed to a supply-and-demand gap in certain end-markets
and as a result, staffing solutions providers with the ability to source and place candidates successfully,
are in greater demand.

**_Outsourcing and offshoring_**

Financial pressures on companies, especially the SMEs, have incentivized them to outsource many of
their non-core functions. Further, due to accelerated business rhythms, companies are increasingly
looking to obtain immediately available resources. This has led to an increased need for temporary
staffing and outsourced support that can be provided rapidly on short notice.

**_Better economics_**

Especially for freelance workers, the prospect of better economics in spite of lower job security has
been a driver of demand in the recent years.

**Description of Certain Income Statement Line Items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue consists of the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the services rendered
during the year to third parties. We mainly derive revenue from the transfer of services over time and
at a point in time in our engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions segments.

We mainly generate revenue from offering HR staffing solutions to our clients. The duration of these
HR staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two years (without minimum
volumes attached to these contracts).

In a small number of cases, we also provide solutions to customers active in larger project-oriented
businesses (such as the telecommunications or the construction end-markets) where apart from staffing,
specific deliverables also have to be provided. Such engagements may take one week up to two to three
months. We do not have a single major customer from which we generate revenue. The size of this
business is also reduced following the divestment of GRITT Projects.

**_Cost of services_**

Cost of services comprises expenses directly attributable to revenue. These costs mainly include
expenses related to job candidates, such as wages, salaries, and social charges but also include costs
associated with freelancers and subcontractors, referred to as “insourced costs.” Cost of services also
includes the housing expenses for foreign and other job candidates referred to as “services costs.”

**_Selling expenses_**

Selling expenses comprise personnel and accommodation expenses in relation to operational activities
at the branches, advertising and marketing, and other selling expenses, as well as the amortization and
impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill. Trademarks, licenses and customer
relationship contracts acquired in a business combination have a finite useful life. They are recognized
at fair value at the acquisition date and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization


-----

and impairment losses. The amortization of customer relationships is based on the projected useful life
of the client (between seven and 15 years).

**_Other general and administrative expenses_**

General and administrative expenses comprise personnel and accommodation expenses of head offices,
IT expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The depreciation expenses component
under this line item largely relates to charges on capitalized buildings, cars and software, among others.

**_Finance income_**

Finance income includes interest income on short-term bank deposits, interest income on loans to
related parties, gains on derecognition of non-convertible bonds, cross-charges to related parties and
swaps.

**_Finance expenses_**

Finance expenses include the interest on borrowings from related parties, banks, bonds, as well as the
refinancing costs and bank fees related to costs associated with the refinancing of bank loans and other
recurring bank fees.

**_Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments_**

Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments is comprised of gains and losses from equity
accounted investments, such as joint ventures.

As of September 30, 2022, Accent held a 50% stake in Sixie BV and House of HR held a minority stake
in Ariad and a minority stake in Happy Recruiter. We do not consider these joint ventures and associates
to be individually material to us. During 2021, we had a loss from an equity accounted investment in
Happy Recruiter, as both the shares in and the loans towards Happy Recruiter were impaired to nil in
the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a loss of €1.5 million for us.

In May 2022, ETA, a subsidiary of the Abylsen group, established a joint venture with DFI, a
subcontractor that ETA works with on specific projects. ETA holds 50% of the shares of this joint
venture for an amount of €25,000. The purpose of this investment is to reduce the amount of insurance
expenses of the projects that ETA and DFI work on. No activity is planned for this joint venture until
2023. In June 2022, Abylsen acquired 35.1% additional shares in Greenworking for a consideration of
€9.8 million and we currently hold 95.1% of the shares in Greenworking.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense is comprised of current tax and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax is recognized
in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity. The components of and the recognition policies for current tax and deferred tax
are set out below:

_Current tax_

Current tax is comprised of the current tax on profits for the year, as well as adjustments made in respect
of prior years. The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws that are enacted or
substantially enacted at the reporting date in the countries where we operate and generate taxable
income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in our tax returns with regard to situations
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the relevant tax authority.

_Deferred tax_


-----

Deferred tax is recognized in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Deferred tax liabilities are, however, not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition
of goodwill. Deferred tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or
liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that
have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply
when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax primarily arises from the valuation of customer relationships and brand names and the
allocation of amortization on them, as well as from fair value adjustments relating to the then existing
senior facilities.

result of the acquisitions completed in 2021 and 2022 and due to favorable market conditions. On a
Like-for-Like basis, our revenue growth was due to overall economic growth fueled by the scarcity of
job candidates, while our EBITDA margin percentage slightly decreased, mainly in the engineering and
consulting segment, due to investment in recruitment capacity and higher sickness ratio.

_Engineering and consulting_

Revenue for the engineering and consulting segment (excluding the corporate segment and intragroup
eliminations) increased by 76.9%, from €459.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021
to €812.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily as a result of the acquisitions
of Cohedron and its subsequent bolt-on acquisitions, including Vanberkel Professionals, Prio
Bewindvoering, Bureau Brug and Sociaal.nl, completed in the second half of 2021, and SOLCOM and
the bolt-on acquisitions of Cohedron, including Vijverberg and Sira Consulting, in the first half of 2022,
as well as the growth of our other Powerhouses due to favorable market conditions.

_Specialized talent solutions_

Revenue for the specialized talent solutions segment (excluding the corporate segment and intragroup
eliminations) increased by 23.2%, from €998.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021
to €1,230.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily as a result of overall
increased commercial activity in the markets in which we operate, with main contributors being Covebo

Revenue from our operations in Belgium increased from €483.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 to €581.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to
the growth of Accent, including the significant growth of NOWJOBS in Belgium, as a result of
favorable market conditions.

Revenue from our operations in the Netherlands increased from €528.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021 to €807.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily
due to the significant organic growth of Covebo and Redmore, as well as the revenue contributions from
Cohedron and TMI following their acquisitions in July 2021 and March 2022, respectively.

Revenue from our operations in Germany increased from €337.7 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 to €516.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to
our acquisitions in Germany, including SOLCOM, which is now a Powerhouse in our engineering and
consulting segment, and avanti and LD Personalvermittlung in our specialized staffing solutions
segment.

Revenue from our operations in France increased from €90.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 to €113.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to
the strong performance of Abylsen due to favorable market conditions, as well as a result of our
investments in a more mature recruiting team in France.

**_Cost of services_**

Our cost of services increased by 39.5% from €1,078.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2021 to €1,503.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to increased
sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as well as the acquisitions completed that expanded
our operations.

**_Selling expenses_**

Our selling expenses increased by 43.4% from €199.0 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 to €285.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to increased sales
in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as well as the acquisitions completed that expanded our
operations.

**_Impairment of goodwill_**

Our impairment of goodwill increased to €13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
from nil in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This was due to an impairment test performed
during the second quarter of 2022 given the rising interest rate in the current market, which we consider
to be an impairment indicator. Pursuant to this impairment test, we identified a goodwill impairment in
relation to the GRITT Powerhouse of €13.3 million, as the recoverable amount was €40.9 million
compared to the carrying value of €54.2 million. We performed another impairment test during the third
quarter of 2022 due to further increases in interest rates, which identified no additional impairments.
We therefore recorded a goodwill impairment of €13.3 million for the nine months ending September
30, 2022, as we consider this change to have a long-term impact.

**_Other general and administrative expenses_**

Our other general and administrative expenses increased by 54.3% from €81.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021 to €126.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
primarily due to increased sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as well as the
acquisitions completed that expanded our operations.

**_Other gains/(loss) net_**

Our other gains/(loss) net increased by 253.8% from a loss of €0.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 to a loss of €1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily
due to a change in the estimated earn-out of avanti by €1.2 million and TMI by €0.7 million.

**_Finance income_**

Our finance income decreased by 82.5% from €5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 to €1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the fair value
adjustment on the embedded derivatives.

**_Finance expense_**

Our finance expenses increased by 98.8% from €51.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 to €103.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to a provision of
€18.2 million break fees related to borrowings repaid following the Acquisition, an increase in
borrowings of €275.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and the fair value
adjustment on the embedded derivatives.

**_Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments_**

Our share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments increased by 116.3% from €(0.7) million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to €0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2022, primarily due to the impairment on the shares of Happy Recruiter that has been recorded in the
nine months ended September 30, 2022.

**_Income tax expense_**

Our income tax expense increased by 20.1% from €20.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2021 to €24.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The effective tax rate for the


-----

nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 291.4%, as compared to 40.6% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021. The average annual tax rate in 2022 was mainly impacted by the losses incurred
by our corporate entities of €64.6 million (excluding non-taxable dividend income of €35.0 million) for
the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to €18.8 million (excluding non-taxable dividend
income of €1.0 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as well as the goodwill
impairment of €13.3 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. If these losses
were excluded, the average annual tax rate would have been 32.1% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 compared to 30.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

Our revenue increased by €453.8 million, or 28.4%, from €1,596.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to €2,050.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of staffing
needs being lower than usual in 2020 due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent
general growth within both of our business segments in 2021 as commercial activities picked up again
as various lockdown measures eased.

The specialized talent solutions and engineering and consulting segments accounted for 67.5% and
32.6% of our revenue, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. The following table sets out
our revenue split by segment for the periods indicated.

_Engineering and consulting_

Revenue for the engineering and consulting segment (excluding the corporate segment and intragroup
eliminations) increased by 28.6%, from €519.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €668.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This growth was primarily the result of growth in sales
volume following the strategic acquisitions of Solyne, Greenworking, Cohedron, Vanberkel
Professionals and Bureau Brug in 2021, as well as the increased growth in Redmore and Abylsen given
the increased average number of consultants employed during 2021.

_Specialized talent solutions_

Revenue for the specialized talent solutions segment (excluding the corporate segment and intragroup
eliminations) increased by 28.3%, from €1,078.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to
€1,383.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This growth was primarily the result of the
increased growth in Covebo and Accent following the tight labor market conditions in 2020 due to the
impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the growth in sales volume following the strategic acquisition of
avanti in 2021.

Revenue from our operations in Belgium increased from €552.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to €657.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the lessening of the
impact of Covid-19 as lockdown measures generally eased and the reopening of the hospitality and nonfood retail sectors.

Revenue from our operations in the Netherlands increased from €588.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to €777.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth
experienced as a result of the strategic acquisition of Cohedron in July 2021, which is currently a
Powerhouse in our engineering and consulting segment, and Cohedron’s subsequent bolt-on
acquisitions of Vanberkel Professionals, Prio Bewindvoering, Bureau Brug and Sociaal.nl later in 2021,
as well as the organic growth in Covebo and Redmore due to the lessening of the impact of Covid-19
primarily as a result of the easing of lockdown measures as well as the increase in demand in our
services due to the scarcity of job candidates in the market.

Revenue from our operations in Germany increased from €336.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to €460.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the lessening of the
impact of Covid-19 as lockdown measures generally eased and our continued growth on account of the
acquisition of avanti in 2021.


-----

Revenue from our operations in France increased from €103.3 million for the year ended December 31,

Our cost of services increased by 26.6%, from €1,188.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
to €1,504.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was in line with the increase
in revenues at 73.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to that of 74.4% for the year
ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, depreciation of €20.4 million was recorded in 2021, mainly
relating to housing facilities that are accounted for as leases from 2021 and depreciated over their
contractual lifetime.

**_Selling expenses_**

Our selling expenses increased by 28.9%, from €221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
to €284.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily due to increased personnel
expenses, mainly resulting from the robust operational activities at our branches in 2021 as client
demands increased following the Covid-19 pandemic.

**_Other general and administrative expenses_**

Our other general and administrative expenses decreased by 3.0%, from €116.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 to €112.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to an overall
decrease in various miscellaneous expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business.

**_Other gains/(loss) net_**

Our other gains/(loss) net decreased by 72.1%, from a gain of €6.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to a gain of €1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an overall
decrease in gains relating to earn-outs.

**_Finance income_**

Our finance income increased by 62.0%, from €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to
€3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a positive fair value adjustment
on derivatives of €2.7 million in 2021 as compared to €1.4 million in 2020.

**_Finance expenses_**


-----

Our finance expenses increased by 16.4%, from €60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
to €70.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily due to higher interest
expense on bank borrowings as a result of the increase in debt attributable to the issuance of the Existing
Senior Subordinated notes in December 2020, partly offset by the positive fair value adjustment
derivatives and lower refinancing costs and bank fees.

**_Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments_**

Our share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments was a profit of €9.0 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The loss in 2021 was primarily due to the impairment of the shares in Happy Recruiter to nil.

**_Income tax expense_**

Our income tax expense increased by 172.9%, from €13.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 to €36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to increased profit. The weighted
average applicable tax rate for 2021 amounted to 44%, as compared to 71% for 2020. The average tax
rate is significantly impacted by the losses incurred in our corporate segment for which no deferred tax
asset is recorded and the tax ruling that Accent requested in 2021 relating to the cross-charge from
Accent to other operational entities within the Group. While the tax ruling is still pending, the
implications that could result from it have been retroactively reflected in the fiscal results for 2020 as
presented in the 2021 financial statements. This adjustment has resulted in a different tax base for 2020,
which has been reflected in the tax-related line items in the income statement for 2021.

**_Revenue_**

Our revenue decreased by €142.1 million, or 8.2%, from €1,738.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 to €1,596.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the overall
decreased demand in our services by our clients as staffing needs reduced due to the economic impact
of Covid-19, and in particular, as a result of the lockdown measures imposed by various governments
worldwide.

The specialized talent solutions and engineering and consulting segments accounted for 67.5% and
32.6% of our revenue, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table sets out
our revenue split by segment for the periods indicated.

_Engineering and consulting_

Revenue for the engineering and consulting segment (excluding the corporate segment and intragroup
eliminations) decreased by 8.3%, from €566.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €519.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily the result of the decrease
in demand for highly skilled professionals across sectors as recruitment came to a halt during the Covid19 pandemic, which led to less consultants on our payroll primarily in Abylsen, GRITT and Continu
Professionals. This was partially offset by the increased employment in Redmore, as the banking and
insurance sectors were relatively less affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the increased
chargeability due to higher utilization as a result of remote working arrangements, which resulted in a
reduction of sick leave.

_Specialized talent solutions_


-----

Revenue for the specialized talent solutions segment (excluding the corporate segment and intragroup
eliminations) decreased by 8.3%, from €1,175.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to
€1,078.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily the result of
businesses closing down in our primary markets, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, due to the
restrictive measures that governments imposed in response to Covid-19, which reduced recruitment
needs for the sectors on which the specialized talent solutions segment predominantly focuses. Accent
and NOWJOBS were particularly severely impacted, as all of Accent’s branches were closed by the
end of March 2020 as a precautionary measure and due to NOWJOBS’s exposure to the leisure and
horeca sectors. Foreign job candidates were also more reluctant to relocate during the early stages of
the Covid-19 pandemic.

Revenue from our operations in Belgium decreased from €672.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 to €552.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to decreased demand
in our services by our clients as staffing needs declined due to the economic impact of Covid-19.

Revenue from our operations in the Netherlands increased from €548.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €588.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased
employment in Redmore, as the banking and insurance sectors were relatively less affected by the
Covid-19 pandemic and the increased chargeability due to higher utilization as a result of remote
working arrangements and the resulting reduction of sick leave.

Revenue from our operations in Germany decreased from €392.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 to €336.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to decreased demand
in our services by our clients as staffing needs reduced due to the economic impact of Covid-19.

Revenue from our operations in France decreased from €109.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 to €103.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to decreased demand
in our services by our clients as staffing needs reduced due to the economic impact of Covid-19.

**_Cost of services_**

Our cost of services decreased by 7.8%, from €1,288.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
to €1,188.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in wages and salaries and social security costs in line with the overall decreased demand in
our services by our clients as staffing needs reduced due to the economic impact of Covid-19.

A comparison of the components of our cost services for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020
is below.

**_Selling expenses_**

Our selling expenses increased by 2.4%, from €215.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to
€221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to an increase in
personnel expenses resulting from our continued operational expansion, as well as an increase in
depreciation due to the impairment recorded on the brand name of Zaquensis.

**_Other general and administrative expenses_**

Our other general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.5%, from €118.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was
primarily due to lower share-based payments and services expenses, partially offset by increases in
depreciation charges.

**_Other gains/(loss) net_**

Our other gains/(loss) net increased by 282.9%, from a gain of €1.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 to a gain of €6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the difference
between the actual earn-out paid and the estimated earn-out paid at the closing dates of the acquisitions
of TechMatch and Book’u in 2020.

**_Finance income_**

Our finance income decreased by 51.6%, from €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to
€2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower fair value adjustment in
derivatives.

**_Finance expense_**

Our finance expenses increased by 44.0%, from €42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
to €60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to an increase in interest


-----

expense on bank borrowings of €9.7 million relating to the facilities entered into in July 2019 and a fair
value adjustment of derivatives of €7.6 million.

**_Share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments_**

Our share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments was a loss of €0.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 compared to a profit of €9.0 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, which
related to the adjustment of our shares in Ariad and Happy Recruiter to reflect the profit and loss of the
year in these two associates.

**_Income tax expense_**

Our income tax expense decreased by 64.7%, from €37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
to €13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to the decrease in
taxable profits given the overall decreased demand in our services by our clients and hence our revenue,
as staffing needs reduced due to the economic impact of Covid-19.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Our principal cash requirements consist of investments in acquisitions, capital expenditures, servicing
financial indebtedness, payroll costs and paying taxes.

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and financing cash flows from
drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility, availability under the Delayed Draw Term Facility and
committed and uncommitted lines. The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain
conditions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

Our ability to generate operating cash flows depends on operating performance, which in turn depends
to some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which
are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” We believe that, based on
our current level of operations as reflected in its results of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and committed and uncommitted lines will be sufficient
to fund operations and capital expenditures and to debt service for at least the next twelve months. The
ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us may be restricted by, among
other things, the amount of distributable reserves and legal prohibitions on such payments or otherwise
distributing funds to us, including for the purpose of servicing debt. Losses or other events could further
reduce the net equity and distributable reserves of our subsidiaries.

In 2020 and 2021, we undertook a number of measures to preserve our liquidity during the Covid-19
pandemic, including managing our costs of services, where possible, by placing consultants or
temporary workers on temporary unemployment or similar schemes (depending on available
government assistance in each of our markets) in order to keep our workforce intact to the extent
possible, so as to be able to place these candidates back on customer assignment once customers
resumed hiring. Expenses were reduced by placing internal staff on temporary unemployment where
revenue necessitated this, for example in branches that were inactive because the sector had closed (such
as the retail non-food and horeca segments). In Accent, this was done as of March 18, 2020, the first
day this was allowed by the authorities. In Abylsen, internal staff were not put on temporary
unemployment, thereby permitting them to remain close to those consultants that were still at the
customer, allowing us to continue to detect further opportunities with those customers that were still
active during the first lock-down. Further, marketing expenses and other expenses were reduced to the
minimum required in 2020, while also being retooled in an effort to draw interest, such as webinars we
organized for customers to explain the impact of government measures. Management also reduced
capital expenditures compared to recent prior years in order to protect cash levels during Covid-19 and


-----

as a precautionary measure also drew on its Existing Revolving Credit Facility in March 2020, which
was subsequently repaid in June 2020.

The proceeds from the Offering of the Notes will be used as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.”

**_Cash flows_**

The following table presents primary components of our cash flow for the periods indicated.

**For the nine months**

**For the year ended December 31,** **ended September 30,**

**2019** **2020** **2021** **2021** **2022**

Net cash flow from financing activities ......................... (27.8) 78.1 (159.4) (144.7) 146.3

_Net cash flow from operating activities_

Net cash flow from operating activities recorded a cash inflow of €116.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022, compared with a cash inflow of €113.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021. This change was principally due to a higher operating profit and the change in
working capital as described under “—Working Capital” below.

Net cash flow from operating activities recorded a cash inflow of €197.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, compared with a cash inflow of €188.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2020. This change was principally due to our growth in 2021 and the rollout of our commercial finance
contracts through 2020 and 2021, as well as the change in working capital as described under “—
_Working Capital” below._

Net cash flow from operating activities recorded a cash inflow of €188.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared with a cash inflow of €115.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This change was principally due to a significant reduction in accounts receivable during the year
ended December 31, 2020 as a result of our factoring program and the Temporary Emergency Bridging
Measure for Sustained Employment grant received in 2020 in the Netherlands in relation to Covid-19,
which was partially offset by the reduction in profit and cash from continued operations, as well as the
cash flow from such operations prior to changes in working capital and income taxes.

_Net cash flow from investing activities_

Net cash flow from investing activities amounted to a net cash outflow of €295.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, compared with a cash outflow of €185.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021. This cash outflow was mainly driven by the acquisitions done in the nine
months ended September 30, 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Net cash flow from investing activities amounted to a net cash outflow of €208.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021, compared with a net cash outflow of €31.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to the various acquisitions that took place in 2021,
amounting to an outflow of €180.8 million, as compared to the outflow of €6.2 million for acquisitions
in 2020.

Net cash flow from investing activities amounted to a net cash outflow of €31.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020, compared with a net cash outflow of €59.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The change was primarily due to a lower amount of cash outflow for acquisitions
in 2020, as compared to the outflow of €26.4 million in 2019 and lower earn-out payments in 2020 as
compared to 2019.


-----

_Net cash flow from financing activities_

Net cash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of €146.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022, compared with a cash outflow of €144.7 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the borrowings received from an additional
add-on facility of €190.0 million on February 3, 2022 and our previous revolving credit facility of €40.0
million which was drawn on July 20, 2022. The cash flow was also impacted by a loan to Cohedron
that has been paid back after its acquisition in 2021 for an amount of € 80.2 million.

Net cash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of €159.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, compared with a cash inflow of €78.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2020. The change was principally due to the repayment of existing loans of Cohedron following its
acquisition in 2021, the cash inflow of €200.0 million in 2020 received from the offering of the Existing
Senior Subordinated Notes and the cash out flow in 2020 relating to a leaver event in an amount of
€37.6 million.

Net cash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of €78.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared with a cash outflow of €27.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This change was principally due to a contribution in equity and capital decrease of negative
€287.4 million in 2019.

**_Working Capital_**

Our resilience is further supported by the cash protective nature of our working capital dynamics. Our
working capital largely consists of receivables (client billings) and payables (job candidate wages,
social security, etc.) tied to individual job candidate placements. For each job candidate placement, the
receivable is higher than the payable with the difference roughly representing the bill-pay spread or
gross margin embedded in the client service agreement and job candidate agreements. This means that
(all else being equal) when we place fewer job candidates, our working capital declines, resulting in a
positive cash balance offsetting the loss of post-tax cash profit. Usually in the last quarter of the year,
our working capital shows a decrease, which is reflected as cash inflow in the cashflow statement. This
is because usually in the second and third quarters of the year working capital is at its highest due to
ramp-up of sales growth in receivables and high payables that tend to occur during this period, such as
holiday payments, accident insurance, and employers liability insurance. The working capital dynamics
and corresponding downside protection for our cash flows are also evident in our recent performance
during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, we had a positive change in working capital, while in 2019 and
2021 we had a negative change in working capital. This demonstrates the counter cyclical nature of our
working capital profile which typically unwinds during periods of economic downturn, thereby
generating larger cash inflow. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our change in
working capital as a percentage of revenue was (1.1)%, 4.2% and (0.1)%, respectively.

Working capital changes amounted to negative €66.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2022, compared to negative €18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily
impacted by the timing of payments of wages and salaries and VAT.

Working capital changes amounted to negative €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to €67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the increased usage
of the factoring program at Accent and GRITT. In addition, working capital was impacted by the Covid19 pandemic which led to a decline in sales, as well as by the factoring program we launched at
TIMEPARTNER. In June 2021, we also launched factoring programs at Continu Professionals and
Covebo, but these were offset by increased sales during the year as economies revived in 2021.

Working capital changes amounted to €67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared
to negative €18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the increased usage
of the factoring program at Accent and GRITT. In addition, working capital was impacted by the Covid

-----

19 pandemic which led to a decline in sales, as well as by the factoring program we launched at
TIMEPARTNER.

_Invoicing_

In order to minimize our credit risk, we follow practices in relation to the issuance and timing of invoices
to customers.

In the specialized talent solutions segment, invoicing is typically done on a weekly basis to customers,
with payment terms ranging from zero up to 60 days, but with a majority on a 30 day payment term.
Customers with no credit history or very small customers receive a zero or seven day credit, allowing
us to closely monitor payment behavior, and to withhold rendering services (i.e., people at work) if a
payment is not made when due.

In the engineering & consulting segment, customers are on average typically somewhat larger SMEs or
are large companies such as financial, transportation or industrial firms. In this segment, invoicing
cycles are most often on a monthly basis, with payment terms between 30 to 60 days, or in France, up
to 90 days.

It should be noted that the company has a credit insurance policy in place covering all Group entities,
up to a limit of €250.0 million.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures represent expenditures primarily relating to IT investments undertaken by the
Group during the periods under review, but also represent expenditures for the purchase of property,
plant and equipment and intangibles, primarily related to our headquarters, furniture and infrastructure
for our branch network, accommodation for foreign job candidates, company cars (purchased by the
TIMEPARTNER Powerhouse, although these are being leased in recent years instead of being
purchased).

**Off-Balance Sheet Obligations**

We entered into factoring agreements with banks during the periods under review, under which trade
receivables of certain entities within the Group are transferred to the factors. These entities are part of
Accent Group and GRITT, and the factoring arrangements involve ING, Belfius and KBC Bank. As the


-----

factor assumes the payment risk and credit under the factoring agreement, this agreement from January
1, 2019 has been accounted for as a non-recourse agreement. During 2020, we implemented a
commercial finance agreement in respect of factoring in TIMEPARTNER and during 2021, we
implemented a commercial finance agreement in respect of factoring in Continu Professionals and
Covebo in a total amount equal to €100.0 million. avanti had a commercial finance agreement in place
on the date of acquisition. As both the late payment risk and credit risk have been substantially
transferred to the counterparty, this agreement has been accounted for as a non-recourse agreement as
the continuing involvement is considered insignificant. As of December 31, 2021, €106.4 million
accounts receivable has been transferred to the factor which has been deducted from the open trade
receivables as per December 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, a further €37.7 million is recorded
as other receivable and comprises the difference between the gross trade receivable sold and the amount
received from the factoring company (as of September 30, 2022, 90% for Accent and GRITT, 90% for
TIMEPARTNER, 80% for Continu Professionals, 70% for Covebo and 90% for avanti).

In addition, SOLCOM had a factoring contract in place as of the date of acquisition, which was
terminated on June 30, 2022. SOLCOM was integrated into the Group’s factoring agreement on June
30, 2022.

Pursuant to our credit insurance, the maximum amount we can borrow under our factoring agreements
is €250.0 million. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have €51.0 million committed for
our Belgian contracts (Accent Group and GRITT). The maximum amount we can borrow under our
non-Belgian contracts is limited by the amount provided under our credit insurance (as reduced by the
amount committed under the Belgian contracts). As of September 30, 2022, we had used €79.0 million
under these contracts.

We expect to continue to engage in factoring in line with the Group’s existing factoring agreements
following the Transactions.

With the exception of the above, we have not engaged in any material off-balance sheet financing
arrangements during the periods under review.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk**

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including limited foreign exchange
risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Our overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance. Our objective is to identify, quantify,
manage and then monitor events or actions that could lead to financial losses. We use derivative
financial instruments to hedge certain interest risk exposures. In particular, we protect the variable
interest rate on loans via the use of caps that limit the exposure to fluctuations of EURIBOR.

Risk management is carried out by our treasury department. Group’s treasury identifies, evaluates and
hedges financial risks with approval from the Board of Directors.

See note 4.1 of the 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

**_Market Risk_**

_Foreign exchange risk_

Our exposure to foreign exchange risk is very limited as our operations are essentially denominated in
euro. Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of these currencies of +/-10% is considered as immaterial.


-----

_Interest rate risk_

Our interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose our
cash flow to an interest rate risk which is offset by the interest rate caps. On an as adjusted basis for the
Offering, most of our indebtedness will consists of the Notes and borrowings under the Facilities and
the Bridge Facility. The Notes will be issued at, and following the Conversion Date, the Bridge Facility
will bear, a fixed interest rate. The Facilities bear, and prior to the Conversion Date the Bridge Facility
bears, variable interest rates, which for loans denominated in euros is essentially fixed when the
reference interest rate is below zero, due to the interest rate floor.

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, we entered into hedging instruments covering approximately
50% of the Facilities at the level of the Issuer to hedge interest rate risk exposure under the Facilities,
and we plan to enter into additional hedging agreements to cover 75% to 100% of the Facilities to hedge
our interest rate risk exposure. The floating rate on the borrowings under the Facilities will be entirely
accounted for at amortized cost, and therefore the impact of changes in the market interest rate on the
fair value of these floating rate borrowings at the closing date will have no impact on the income
statement or on the equity. The Group does not apply hedge accounting.

EURIBOR floating rate borrowings which are not covered by the swaps are subject to interest rate risk.

**_Credit risk_**

Our credit risk mainly arises from credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables, as
well as from cash and cash equivalents, favorable derivative financial instruments, and deposits with
banks and financial institutions.

**_Risk management_**

We have no significant concentrations of credit risk other than that for ordinary debtors. We have
policies to ensure that the services are provided to customers with an appropriate credit history. Credit
risk is managed locally by each subgroup (brand) and certain companies have credit insurance in place.
Credit risk mainly arises as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables.

The credit quality of customers, considering the financial position of customers, past experience and
other factors, is closely assessed by the credit department on a regular basis. During 2020, a credit
insurance program was set-up throughout the Group to enable us to have control over open receivables
during the challenging Covid-19 pandemic. Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external
ratings in accordance with limits set by the finance committee. The utilization of credit limits is
regularly monitored.

Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by our counterparties.

_Impairment of financial assets_

We have three types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model:

- trade receivables for sales of services;

- contract assets resulting from project services in progress; and

- debt investments carried at amortized cost.

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was
no identified impairment loss.

_Trade receivables_


-----

We apply the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based
on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before
each reporting year-end, and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period.
The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

Forward-looking information has been considered in assessing the Expected Credit Loss impairment
under IFRS 9, taken into consideration the possible downside resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.
This did not result in a significant impact on the Expected Credit Loss model assumptions.

Trade receivables and project related receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation
of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, among others, the
failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with us, and a failure to make contractual payments
for a period of greater than 120 days past due. Several factors are considered in assessing the likelihood
of impairment which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within
operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same
line item.

We first apply the policy relating to impairment of the trade receivables under the incurred loss model,
and then, for the rest of receivables which are not provided for, we apply the expected credit loss model,
and recognize an additional provision. As of December 31, 2021, 78% of our trade receivables were
less than one month old, 13% were between one month and two months old and the remaining 8% were
between two months and one year or two or more years old. As of December 31, 2021, 97% of the trade
receivables were not impaired, while 3% were impaired.

As of December 31, 2021, trade receivables of €36.8 million (December 31, 2020: €40.4 million,
December 31, 2019: €56.9 million) were past due but not impaired. These receivables are expected to
be recovered and have not been provided for because they relate to well-known customers and they are
strictly followed up by the credit department. The aging analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:

**As of December 31,**

**Receivables past due but not provided for:** **2019** **2020** **2021**
**(€ in millions)**
Less than 1 month................................................................................................... 41.4 30.0 24.3
Between 1 and 2 months ........................................................................................ 8.9 5.4 8.0
Between 2 months and year ................................................................................... 5.8 4.6 3.6
Between 1 year and 2 years.................................................................................... 0.3 0.1 0.7
More than 2 years ................................................................................................... 0.5 0.4 0.1

**56.9** **40.4** **36.8**
**Total .........................................................................................................................**

As of December 31, 2021, trade receivables of €6.3 million (December 31, 2020: €7.5 million,
December 31, 2019: €5.6 million) were impaired and provided for. The provision was made in line with
the incurred loss model and expected credit loss model, as described under “—Credit Risk” above.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and use of trade supplier credit terms.


-----

Cash flow forecasting is performed in our operating entities and aggregated by the Group treasury.
Group treasury monitors rolling forecasts of our liquidity requirements to ensure we have sufficient
cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on our undrawn committed
borrowing facilities at all times so that we do not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where
applicable) on any of our borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration our debt
financing plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets and, if
applicable, external regulatory or legal requirements. We also use factoring agreements with certain
banks in order to obtain early access to cash flows. See also “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
_Overview” above._

**_Capital risk management_**

Our objectives when managing capital are to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern in
order to provide returns for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital
structure to reduce the cost of capital.

**Accounting Policies**

See note 2 in our 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the
accounting policies affecting our results.

**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued, which are adopted by us as of the
specified effective date. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our
Financial Statements. See note 2.2 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 2 to our

**Overview of the Staffing Solutions Industry**

We are a diversified human resources solutions provider serving clients located primarily in Belgium,
France, Germany and the Netherlands through ten business units. We operate through two distinct
segments: engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions. Our engineering and consulting
segment is focused on supplying clients with high-skilled white-collar consultants and mid to highskilled professionals to meet clients’ specialized needs in a variety of end-markets including financial,
industrial and construction end-markets. Through this segment, we also staff one to three-year
construction projects, mainly through secondment or time and materials contracts.

Our specialized talent solutions typically supplies a small number of high demand mid-and lower skilled
blue-collar and white-collar workers to clients for specialized positions on a temporary basis. We source
our candidates both from our primary markets and also increasingly from our international recruitment
network. Across both segments, in addition to the positive secular trends supporting the whole staffing
solutions industry, the diversity of our clients’ end-markets and geographic markets supports our
business resiliency and outlook.

Staffing solutions providers fall into one of three categories: mono-specialists, multi-specialists and
generalists. A specialty in this sense is a combination of at least two out of three types of expertise: (i)
functional expertise, or a focus on a specific skill level or specific job functions (such as lawyers,
engineers, low-skilled blue-collar workers); (ii) industrial expertise, a focus on a specific end-market
(such as food production or construction); and (iii) local expertise, a focus on a given region or city.
Mono- and multi-specialists (which only differ from each other based on the number of specialties they
serve) provide a focus on a given specialty with a dedicated sales force, specific processes and tailored
value proposition focused typically on smaller volumes per client and a possible focus on a specific
client size. Generalists, on the other hand serve a broad range of activities, clients, contract sizes and
contract types with generalist sales forces, similar processes and offer less tailored solutions to a wide
range of clients.

**Staffing Solutions Industry Size and Outlook**

The total market size for the staffing market in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France was
approximately €95 billion in revenue in 2019. After dropping to approximately €81 billion in 2020 due
to the pandemic, the market recovered in 2021, totaling approximately €94 billion (the “Total Market”).

These four key geographic markets are characterized by high average salaries, low unemployment and
a high demand for scarcity-driven profiles and are well developed and mature in the temporary staffing
and consulting fields. As a result of these trends, the number of temporary workers in these markets has
increased significantly over the last decade. Our Total Market reflects the type of staffing markets for
which we provide services in our primary geographies on a country basis, but it does not reflect the


-----

narrower type of job candidates that many of our business units recruit and supply to clients or the
specific end-market niches on which they concentrate.

_Belgium 2022; Largest Staffing Firms in the Netherlands and Market Overview (December 2021); Largest Staffing Firms in Germany_
_(December 2021), Largest Staffing Firms in France and Market Overview (December 2021))_

As shown above, the staffing market in the countries in which we operate are expected to grow from
€94 million in aggregate revenue for 2021 at a rate of 5% per annum to a total of €107 billion in
aggregate revenue by 2024 in the absence of a downturn in the broader economy. We believe that such
growth is to be expected in the future, driven by long-term structural changes in the employment market
of each of our core geographic markets as well as a regulatory environment that allows for flexible
staffing services.

**Short-Term Outlook in our key geographies**

Governments in each of our key markets are expecting the economic rebound to continue beyond 2021.
As such, in 2022, Belgium real GDP is expected to grow by 2.8%, France real GDP by 2.6 %, Germany
real GDP by 1.6% and the Netherlands real GDP by 4.6%, according to the European Commission
forecasts from November 2022 (see table below).

With regard to the staffing industry, recovery periods after a crisis usually favor temporary work and
outsourcing as companies look to start scaling up their workforce while limiting the weight on their cost
base. It is especially true in countries such as the key markets in which we operate in which the
permanent workers are more protected, limiting companies’ flexibility.

According to Staffing Industry Analysts, a global advisor on staffing and workforce solutions, the
staffing market will experience strong rebound post Covid-19 pandemic. The table below shows SIA
estimates of the actual year-on-year change in staffing revenue in 2020 and 2021, and how it is expected
to grow in 2022, 2023 and 2024 for each of our key markets.

**Belgium**

The below graph, based on data from Federgon, the Belgian federation of staffing agencies, illustrates
the year-on-year growth evolution of the number of hours worked daily by temporary agency workers,
seasonally and calendar-basis adjusted data, in Belgium starting January 2020.

_Source: Federgon_

The temporary hours worked experienced a strong decline in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic,
followed by a sharp rebound in April 2021, to then come back to a more flattish state.

The temporary work sector in Belgium showed an extraordinary capacity for resilience in 2020. In
March and April 2020, during the first confinement, the sector experienced a gigantic decline, with a
loss of almost half of its volume of activity. The sector then gradually recovered over the months. In
Belgium there was a total decline of 15.2% in 2020.

Belgium had its peak levels in temporary work in April 2021 (59.9%), with the increase in the number
of hours worked daily by temporary agency workers was driven by the rise in activity in the service
voucher sector.

In Belgium, in line with the rest of our key geographies, we can see a tight labor market with increasing
demand due to macro-economic uncertainty and labor scarcity. Belgium unemployment rate has been
growing since its lowest value in 2019 (5.4%), although it still was relatively low at 6.4% in 2021,
below the last 10 years average of 7.1%.

In the second quarter of 2022, there were no less than 213,822 vacancies in Belgium (an increase of
24% compared to the second quarter of 2021) and reaching its historical peak levels according to
Eurostat.

According to SIA, Belgium staffing revenue was €8.6 billion in 2021 and is expected to increase by 4%
in 2022 and 6% in 2023.

**France**

The chart below shows the evolution of the France Staffing market, based on data from SIA, compared
to Abylsen, based on company information. While the France Staffing market has grown at a 1.8%
CAGR over the 2008-2021 period, it can be observed Abylsen has outperformed the French Staffing
market growing at a 14.1% CAGR.

Abylsen’s remarkable organic growth is driven by its positioning within the engineering and consulting
sector, which demonstrates House of HR resilience through-the-cycle but also during downturns. While
the France Staffing market had negative growth during the global financial crisis (0.7)% CAGR 20082011) and the Covid-19 pandemic ((4.6)% CAGR 2019-2021), Abylsen managed to outperform the
market growing at 31.9% and 0.1%.

_Source: World Bank_

The unemployment rate in France has had a declining trend since 2015, compressing from 10.4% to
reach 8.1% in 2021. 2020 and 2021 have presented the lowest unemployment rates since 2009 according
to the World Bank, and the trend is expected to continue decreasing in the upcoming years.

While the French market saw its combined revenue drop sharply in 2020 (a decrease of 23%) according
to SIA, the 50 largest firms outperformed the market as their combined revenue decreased by 19%,
compared to 2019. They expect further consolidation happening in this market, primarily benefiting
national groups, competing together to become the largest homespun staffing group.

Despite French economic growth rate being downgraded due to supply chain difficulties and the energy
shocks stemming from the war in Ukraine, SIA expects positive forward momentum after speaking with
several players in the market. Permanent placement is particularly strong. Data from SIA shows that
temporary work turnover increased 13% in February 2022 YoY, and the number of hours worked
increased by 10.5%.

According to SIA data, the size of the French market was €30.4 billion in 2021, up 19% from €25.6
billion in 2020. In 2020 there were approximately 2,000 staffing firms in France, according to SIA.

The French staffing market is expected to increase by 6% in 2022 and 1% in 2023 according to SIA.

**Netherlands**

The below graph, based on data from ABU, the Dutch Federation of Private Employment Agencies,
illustrates the evolution of the total amount of hours worked by temporary workers in the Netherlands
starting January 2020.

_Source: ABU_

Following the loosening of restrictions in May 2020, the staffing industry in the Netherlands began
recovering from June onwards and gradually narrowed the gap with 2019 levels. Since reaching its peak
in mid-2021, the evolution of the total amount of hours worked by temporary workers in the Netherlands
kept growing at a stable rate until December 2021, when it experienced a 14% decline, followed by a
rebound of 3% in January 2022.

_Source: World Bank_

_Source: Eurostat, as of the fourth quarter of each year, unless stated_

In the Netherlands, the unemployment rate reached a 15-year low in 2019 (3.4%), slightly increasing to
4.0% in 2021, although still 1% below the past 15-year average (5.0%). Job vacancies is at its peak with
approximately 450,000 vacancies in the third quarter of 2022. This current high level of vacancies offers
House of HR additional protection in a downturn scenario. Based on data from the global financial
crisis, a reduction of approximately 100,000 in job vacancies would still result in approximately
350,000 unfilled positions.

**Germany**

The below graph, based on data from Statistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit, illustrates the evolution of
the number of temporary workers in Germany, which has been generally increasing since the beginning
of the century.

_Source: Statistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit_

During the financial crisis of 2008, the number of temporary workers decreased substantially to reach
580,000 in April 2009 (year-over-year decrease of 24.0%), although it recovered promptly with a yearover-year growth of 23.9% in April 2010. Similarly, temporary workers also declined down during the
outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, followed by a recovery in the beginning of 2021, with the
number of temporary workers now being higher than pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels.

The staffing market has since recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, and since the lifting of the
restrictions, the number of job registrations has then consistently increased.

Although Germany has been relatively effective in managing the pandemic, the country's sizeable
manufacturing sector is highly export-oriented and exposed to both supply-chain disruption and
shrinking global demand. As a result, SIA estimates that total German staffing market revenue fell by
10% in 2020.

Nevertheless, Germany has experienced substantial growth in 2021 (12%), which is generally set to
continue at a more subdued rate in 2022 (5%) and continuing a decline into 2023 (4%) according to
SIA. According to the German Federal Employment Agency, there were approximately 850,000
temporary workers in Sep 2022, a year-on-year increase of 1%, although still down 21% from the preCovid-19 pandemic peak in November 2017.

Amongst the four key geographies, Germany has experienced the largest decline in unemployment
rates. From 8.7% in 2007, it reached 3.5% in 2021. Job vacancies have almost tripled since 2007,
growing from approximately 600,000 to 1.8 million in the third quarter of 2022 according to Eurostat.

**Staffing Solutions Secular Industry Drivers**

Demand for the types of solutions we provide has increased and is expected to continue growing in the
future, once markets have recovered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, due to a number of
positive secular trends:

_Aging populations. As the population of our target markets ages and workers exit the labor pool, there_
has been an increase in competition among employers to fill the gaps left behind. This has left an
opening for staffing intermediaries, especially those like our Group that have a proven track record of
identifying and matching the right candidates to the right jobs, to fill these vacant positions with
qualified talent. Additionally, a scarcity of talent for certain roles is driving wages up, which in turn can
increase the pricing power of staffing firms for the solutions and staffing we provide.

_Technological changes. In recent years, candidates are increasingly turning to online job boards when_
seeking out a position, particularly through traffic generated by mobile devices. At the same time,
clients expect more efficient services at a lower cost that can only be delivered through the use of digital
tools. We have also seen an increase in the number of passive job seekers who apply through targeted
advertisements on social media when they were not actively searching for a position at the time. The
market has also experienced the development of new platforms, such as Uber Works in the United
States, which, however, announced in May 2020 the closure of their operations in light of the Covid-19
pandemic, according to their official press release. Such platforms may be considered competitors, since


-----

they sometimes are able to attract people directly to be employed for them via freelance or independent
status. Nevertheless, such platforms lack a human touch in the services they provide, and authorities in
different countries monitor fair treatment of workers by these platforms and are looking to ensure that
there is no unfair competition with other forms of labor. Such monitoring is especially common in the
EU, where regulation and labor unions are stronger than in other countries.

_Career mobility and the need to re-skill._ Millennial workers, especially highly skilled ones, are
increasingly mobile and seeking a varied career path, driving the need for re-skilling. This re-skilling
can be provided through both formal and on-the-job training that is typically provided as part of
temporary work agreements.

_Diversity, inclusion and corporate social responsibility. As the diversity trend becomes mainstream_
across clients, service providers have an opportunity to provide increasing value to their clients by
tapping into broad, international pools of candidates.

_Increased premium on quality of life. It is increasingly difficult to find qualified candidates to fill some_
roles that offer long hours and difficult conditions, as younger generations of workers are placing a
fairly large premium on happiness in their personal and professional lives. This has contributed to a
supply and demand gap in certain end-markets and as a result, staffing solutions providers with a more
flexible and agile organization and the ability to source and place candidates successfully, are in greater
demand.

_Outsourcing and offshoring. Financial pressures on companies, especially the small- to medium-sized_
enterprises (“SMEs”), have incentivized them to outsource many of their non-core functions. Further,
due to accelerated business rhythms, companies are increasingly looking to obtain immediately
available resources. This has led to an increased need for temporary staffing and outsourced support
that can be provided rapidly on short notice.

_Better economics. Especially for freelance workers, the prospect of better economics in spite of lower_
job security has been a driver of demand in the recent years.

As a result of these secular trends, both employers and workers increasingly turn towards flexible
staffing models, driving demand for extended workforce solutions. According to an external consultant
analysis, in Belgium, Netherlands and France, the number of workers that are part of the extended
workforce (i.e., contractors and other freelancers) has grown from 2016 to 2021 at a CAGR of 3.9%,
2.5% and 4.4%, respectively. These growth rates are above those registered in the total working
population, which over the same period has grown at a CAGR of 1.0% in Belgium, 1.3% in the
Netherlands and 0.4% in France. This is also evidenced by the growth in penetration of the extended
workforce as part of the total workforce, with penetration rates in 2021 ranging from 7.2% in France to
10.2% in the Netherlands.

**Our Total Market**

We operate primarily in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands in a variety of specialties with
a combined total market of approximately €94 billion in revenue as of 2021. We expect our Total
Market to grow at a rate of approximately 5% per annum in revenues to an estimated €107 billion by
2024, a growth rate above that of the broader staffing solutions industry, driven by a variety of favorable
end-market dynamics leading to increases in outsourcing and billing rates. We operate through ten
business units in two segments: engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions. The
discussion below focuses on the key factors affecting each of our business units.

**Engineering and Consulting**

**_Abylsen_**

Abylsen is an engineering and consulting Powerhouse headquartered in France, with operations in
France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Luxembourg. Abylsen operates in a competitive but
fragmented market, where it is a relatively small company which challenges primarily large global
consulting or mid-sized global companies or brands, as well as regional companies or brands.

_End-market overview and drivers_

Historically, growth in Abylsen’s Addressable Market has been driven by companies’ spending on
research and development. It is expected that, once markets have recovered from the Covid-19
pandemic, such spending will increase again going forwards and will be the key driver of growth in
Abylsen’s Addressable Market, as end-markets reliant on research and development (such as the
automotive, energy, pharmaceutical and aerospace industries) respond and adapt to changing
technologies for their sustained growth. Additional factors such as increased outsourcing penetration
(France is already one of the most mature countries for outsourcing of research and development) and
increasing billing rates (moderate due to pre-existing difficulties in sourcing engineers in France) are
likely to further drive market growth in the future.

According to external consultant analysis, Abylsen’s addressable market is expected to grow at low to
mid-single digit in the next five years.

_Competitive landscape_

According to external consultant analysis, competition in Abylsen’s Addressable Market includes a lot
of players but is highly fragmented, with the four largest players capturing less than 30% of the market
in 2021. According to external consultant analysis, the market is defined by three types of competitors:
(i) large global consulting firms (including Capgemini Engineering (formerly Altran), Alten, Akka and
Assystem), (ii) mid-size global/regional firms (such as Sii, MCA, agap2 and Davidson) and (iii) smaller
regional/local firms. Abylsen falls into the mid-size global/regional category, with a smaller market
share than the four large global consulting firms. Nevertheless, Abylsen has been growing faster and
achieved a higher EBITDA margin than its larger competitors, reaching 17.5% in 2021, compared to
competitors such as Alten, which had an EBITDA margin of 12.3%.

**_Redmore_**

Redmore is a provider of specialized secondment and consulting services in our engineering and
consulting segment headquartered in the Netherlands, with operations in the Netherlands, Poland and a
newly opened international branch in Spain (Triple A – Risk Finance) and Portugal (ITDS). We
typically provide consulting and secondment services to clients through job candidates with university
degrees or applied university degrees who are predominantly but not exclusively on indefinite term
contracts with us. Redmore and its boutiques operate primarily in the banking and insurance sectors,
but also in the public sector and work with companies seeking financial staffing in enterprise recourse


-----

planning (“ERP”) implementation, with competitors of a variety of sizes, including large global
companies and the “Big Four” accountancy firms.

_End-market overview and drivers_

Redmore’s Addressable Market consists mainly of three markets in the Netherlands: the market for
secondment of financial specialists, the market for actuarial and risk consulting and the market for
ERP/finance and control consulting (and excludes ITDS). In recent years, Redmore has also expanded
its business into other European countries such as Poland and Belgium (15% of 2021 _Pro Forma_
Management Adjusted Revenue per management estimates) and to a lesser extent Germany,
Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain (less than 3% of 2021 Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue
per management estimates).

Over the past 15 years an increase in secondment penetration in the market has been the main driver of
growth in the Netherlands. Post Covid-19 pandemic, growth in Redmore’s specific client end-markets
in the coming years is expected to be driven by an increasing need for specialist positions in the financial
sector as a result of changing regulations, compliance, digitization and consolidation.

According to external consultant analysis, Redmore’s addressable market is expected to grow at low to
mid-single digit in the next five years.

_Competitive landscape_

Redmore competes with various entities in the financial services end-market including the big four
accounting firms (namely, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers), which
accounted for approximately 40-50% of the market in 2021, as well as other professional services and
consultancy firms. Although the competitive environment for each of Redmore’s niches is different,
strong consolidation of the market in recent years has resulted in significant growth for both Redmore
and its competitors. We believe that Redmore’s businesses are leaders in their respective Addressable
Markets in terms of revenue.

Redmore is built around five labels with each serving a specific niche:

- _Talent&Pro focuses on secondments in the banking, insurance, pensions and actuarial end-_
markets. Talent&Pro is a significant player in the financial secondment market in the
Netherlands, facing competition from a variety of other firms, including Brunel, which has a
broad focus across IT, finance, engineering and law, Welten, which is specialized in candidate
training with project based work, and Young Capital, which is a digital disruptor across the
finance, sales, IT and marketing end-markets.

- _Triple A_ focuses on financial consulting in actuarial and risk management, with actuarial
consultancy firms, including Willis Tower Watson, Mercer, and Milliman, and the big four
accounting firms as its most significant competitors.

- _Profource_ focuses on finance staffing, ERP consulting and provides business process
outsourcing services. As such, it maintains a unique market position which combines expertise
in finance and ERP. It faces competition from the big four accounting firms, whose consulting
departments include both finance and ERP, Eiffel, which is specialized in finance and legal
staffing, focusing on the government sector, and DPA, which is focused on candidate training
in the finance, IT and engineering end-markets.

- _ITDS_ provides specialist consulting for insurance companies, pension funds and banks,
focusing on risk management, digital transformation, and cost-saving programs. Competitors
for ITDS are Accenture, Deloitte and Capgemini.


-----

- _Vialegis primarily specializes in the legal staffing solutions market in Belgium, though it has_
developed activities in Spain, Luxembourg and Germany over recent years. Vialegis operates
in two primary niches: (i) legal interim management and secondments and (ii) legal search and
selection, both of which are relatively small and developing markets expected to grow rapidly
in the future.

**_GRITT (formerly TEC Alliance)_**

GRITT is a multi-specialist in the secondment and project management of technicians and engineers
for the Belgian construction end-market. GRITT focuses on three distinct market niches each with its
own specific drivers and competition:

- _GRITT focuses on the secondment of engineers in Antwerp and, to a lesser extent, Flanders_
with a focus on the chemical, pharmaceutical and life sciences end-markets. GRITT’s market
growth is driven by an increase in capital expenditures, a moderate increase in outsourcing and
a moderate increase of billing rates relative to inflation. The market includes a lot of players
with strong competition from certain larger Benelux competitors, such as STAR engineering as
well as more specialized competition from Talenco.

- _Logi-technic focuses on the secondment of technicians in East and West Flanders with a focus_
on recurring maintenance and facility management needs for industrial equipment in the food
end-market. Logi-technic operates in a growing market due to a growing shortage of skilled
technicians as a result of existing high employment rates in Flanders, driving billing rates higher
as well as recurring business needs for maintenance of installed equipment. Such growth is
expected to be seen in the future, once markets have recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic.

**_Continu_**

Continu Professionals is a specialist in finding white-collar secondment solutions for the engineering
and construction markets in our engineering and consulting segment. It is headquartered in the
Netherlands, with branches throughout the Netherlands, two branches in Belgium and a branch in
Germany that was opened at the beginning of 2019. Continu Professionals provides secondment
solutions to clients through job candidates who are planners, foremen, superintendents, technical
designers, project managers, architects and a wide variety of engineers such as in manufacturing,
infrastructure and construction (including specialization in social housing corporations) research and
development, and mechanical.

_End-market overview and drivers_

Continu serves the Dutch engineering and construction markets, which have experienced steady growth
over the past several years. Continu’s Addressable Market consists of the staffing market for
infrastructure, engineering and construction end-markets in the Netherlands, with a growing presence
in Belgium and Germany.

Post Covid-19 pandemic, growth in Continu’s Addressable Market is expected to be mainly driven by
two factors:

- growth among SMEs within engineering and construction that largely stems from infrastructure
projects, which typically have long project durations and tend to have a predictable revenue
stream; and

- a continued shortage of mid to high-skilled engineers and technicians able to work on
infrastructure and engineering projects, leading to increased outsourcing penetration and
accounting, as the temporary to permanent model has been successful and desirable in an
environment where the demand for permanent labor exceeds its supply.


-----

According to external consultant analysis, Continu’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at midsingle digit in the next five years.

_Competitive landscape_

Continu benefits from a high level of expertise and broad national coverage, and is the top three player
in its Addressable Market in terms of revenue. Its main competitors include: TMC, which is mostly
focused on software and electrical engineering, Voort, which focuses on a similar specialty as Continu,
and Brunel, which focuses on the oil and gas sector.

_SOLCOM_

SOLCOM is a German specialist in contracting services covers primarily lucrative, highly specialized
IT and engineering segments across various industries within the DACH region. SOLCOM mostly
works with experienced freelancers only. SOLCOM facilitates and manages the process of matching
clients with experienced freelancers throughout the contracting period.

_End-market overview and drivers_

SOLCOM serves the German IT and engineering experts across all end industries, through qualified
specialists and managers with expertise and experience in all sectors of IT and engineering.

According to an external consultant analysis conducted in July 2021, the market is highly fragmented,
where approximately 2,000 small players account for approximately 80% of the market, while the top
10 companies represent approximately the remaining 20%.

SOLCOM’s end market is growing and resilient, driven by robust megatrends across all industries:

- Increasing demand for contracting services in Germany driven by shortage of skilled workers,
demographic change, increasing technological complexity and demand for digitalization

- Complex legal status

- Demographic change as an increasing challenge that House of HR is being able to manage
through the expansion of internal divisions

According to external consultant analysis, SOLCOM’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at mid
to high single digit in the next five years.

_Competitive landscape_

Expert know-how providers can be segmented based on their geographical and segment coverage.
SOLCOM is a national specialized expert know-how provider. SOLCOM’s main competitors are
divided into two sub-categories:

- nationwide non-specialized: Hays, Ferchau, Gulp, SThree, Allgeier, Robert Half, Brunel,
WestHouse and Krongaard; and

- Nationwide specialized (in IT): Etengo, Top Itservices, Neusta and Future Consulting

**_Cohedron_**

Cohedron is a Dutch full-service staffing provider specializing in the government and public sector with
a goal to make a meaningful impact. With approximately 3,054 qualified specialists and over 30 years
of experience, Cohedron supports and advises public authorities and non-profit organizations through
its offering of outsourcing of processes and secondment of qualified specialists, as well as consultancy


-----

to organizations and public authorities in areas such as debt counselling, budget management and
administration to drive efficiencies and costs savings.

_End-market overview and drivers_

Cohedron serves the Dutch public sector, on a market driven by robust mega-trends:

- Population wide

    - Aging population

    - Rising inflation

    - Rising self-employment

    - Rising number of people needing support

- Segment-specific

    - Rising healthcare expenditures

    - Housing shortage

    - Government transparency

    - Energy transition

These drivers should foster customer demand due to the shift from a classical welfare state to a
decentralized participation society, along with the increasing burden on municipalities increasing their
need for specialized resources and integrated solutions.

According to external consultant analysis, Cohedron’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at low
to mid-single digit in the next five years.

_Competitive landscape_

The market is fragmented, but slightly consolidating mainly through M&A of leading market
participants:

- M&A of public specialist expected to continue (e.g., Wyzer combination of Langhenkel &
Talenter in 2018, BMC acquisition by Randstad in 2017)

- Consolidating municipality landscape

Cohedron is positioned within the top three market participants, together with Maandag, which has lost
market share due to volume-focused profile sourcing at the expense of quality and Randstad, still
winning a lot of tenders due to its dedicated tender team and experience.

**Specialized Talent Solutions**

Our specialized talent solutions segment includes our operating companies Accent, Covebo,
TimePartner and TMI (acquired in early 2022) which cover the short-term employment market for high
demand mid-skilled blue-collar workers in Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively. Both of these
geographic end-markets have seen significant growth over the past years, as long term trends in the
staffing solutions industry combined with a tightening labor market have increased demand for service
providers like us to fill the need for specialized workers. Growth in the future will continue to be largely


-----

driven by growing economies in both regions and end-markets in which House of HR’s Powerhouses
provide services, as well as a large and growing gap between the demand for certain specialized
positions and the supply of candidates willing to perform these jobs.

**_Accent_**

Accent is a specialized staffing Powerhouse focused exclusively on the Belgian specialty market, with
operations in Belgium and offices in Poland, Romania, Moldova and Portugal for the sourcing of job
candidates from its international recruiting network. Accent operates in a competitive and consolidated
market where it challenges larger global staffing solutions companies or brands, as well as regional
companies or brands.

_End-market overview and drivers_

Post recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, growth in the Belgian staffing solutions industry will
continue to be largely driven by the tightening of the Belgian labor market as employment is growing
faster than the active population, particularly in Flanders. This trend is expected to result in fewer job
seekers per vacancy leading to a scarcity of candidates. As a result, demand has grown for companies
such as ours that are able to provide appropriate qualified candidates to clients in need of staffing and
this demand is expected to continue in the future.

According to external consultant analysis, Accent’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at low
single digit in the next five years.

_Competitive landscape_

Accent was the fourth-largest staffing provider in terms of 2017 revenue within the Belgian total staffing
market, behind the larger staffing firms of Randstad, Recruit and Adecco, each of which focuses on
larger accounts, which are typically lower margins.

**_Covebo_**

Covebo is a blue-collar specialized staffing Powerhouse. It is focused on the Dutch specialty blue-collar
staffing market, with operations in the Netherlands, as well as its branches in Hungary, Lithuania, Spain,
Poland and Romania, which are part of its international recruiting network.

_End-market overview and drivers_

Covebo had an Addressable Market consisting of the staffing market in the Netherlands in the trade,
engineering, logistics and construction end-markets.

Structural growth in Covebo’s Addressable Market is due to a variety of factors, including:

- underlying growth in the Dutch construction, engineering and logistics and food production
end-markets;

- growth due to the increasing penetration of temporary staffing as the demand for permanent
labor exceeds its supply; and

- increases in billing rates to correlate with salary increases within its clients’ end-markets.

There is a general scarcity in the Dutch domestic workforce willing to work in these end-markets due
to changing perceptions of working conditions and possible night shifts as a result of the increased
premium on quality of life global trend, favoring companies like us with the ability to source candidates
for these positions internationally.

_Competitive landscape_


-----

Covebo competes with smaller, regional or local competitors and larger generalists. Regional peers
include: Otto Workforce, a direct competitor and that has a similar end-market focus and sourcing
strategy to Covebo, though it is smaller in geographical scope; and Olympia, which is a mid-sized firm,
larger than Covebo, serving most end-markets throughout the Netherlands. Smaller competitors, such
as VDB, Sherpa and McDOIT, typically compete on smaller assignments but find it difficult to match
Covebo on price as they provide candidates in lower volumes. The larger generalists, such as Randstad
and Adecco compete heavily in volume driven projects, yet find it difficult to serve the small-volume,
specialized niches where we excel and do not offer a full service package or training.

According to external consultant analysis, Covebo’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at low to
mid-single digit in the next five years.

**_TIMEPARTNER_**

TIMEPARTNER specializes in the staffing of high-demand blue-collar workers in Germany and offers
tailor-made and integrated flexible HR-solutions in the field of temporary staffing, personnel placement,
provision of temporary workers and on-site management. In June 2021, we acquired avanti, which
complements TIMEPARTNER’s service portfolio by adding a presence in the medical and healthcare
segment. In addition, Zaquensis, previously a Powerhouse in our legacy general staffing segment, is
now part of the TIMEPARTNER operation following the partial merger between TIMEPARTNER and
Zaquensis in the second quarter of 2021.

_German general staffing market drivers_

In the future, it is expected that growth in this market will be driven by an increase in the number of
hours worked and overall temporary staffing penetration as decreasing unemployment and a shortage
of low-skilled blue-collar workers will force companies to seek out alternatives to source qualified
candidates. Billing rates are also expected to increase driven by the increase in minimum wages for
temporary workers established as a result of regulatory reform.

According to external consultant analysis, TIMEPARTNER’s Addressable Market is expected to
remain flat in the next five years.

**_TMI_**

On March 3, 2022, we acquired TMI, our new Powerhouse in our specialized talent solutions segment.
TMI specializes in providing staffing service for the healthcare sector in the Netherlands, assisting with
the recruitment of candidates for healthcare providers such as hospitals, public care institutions,
ambulance staff and nursing homes. TMI also supplies temporary staff, intermediates for freelancers,
and offers flexible jobs. Their job candidates usually include doctors, nursing staff, psychologists, and
pharmacists.

_End-market overview and drivers_

TMI is active in the attractive and growing Dutch healthcare staffing market which benefits from longterm healthcare trends where demand for healthcare professionals is high and ever-increasing.
According to an external analysis, TMI’s focus markets are (size of total healthcare workforce being
approximately 1.4 million employees):

- nursing, care and home care (representing approximately 470,000 employees in 2020);

- hospitals and other expert care & university medical centers (representing approximately
300,000 employees in 2020);

- disabled care & youth care (representing approximately 200,000 employees in 2020); and


-----

- mental healthcare (representing approximately 100,000 employees in 2020).

Continued shortages of healthcare personnel are expected to last until 2030, driven by Netherland’s
aging population and aging healthcare workforce:

- Demand for healthcare and cure until 2030 is expected to increase due to the aging Dutch
population:

    - Older than 55: 37% of the Dutch population expected by 2030 (CAGR increase of 1.6%
(2016-30)).

    - Between 35 and 55: 24% of the Dutch population expected by 2030 (CAGR decrease of
0.7% (2016-30)).

    - Younger than 35: 40% of the Dutch population expected by 2030 (CAGR increase of
2016- 0.2% (2016-30)).

- The Dutch healthcare workforce is expected to grow older with a CAGR increase of 4% for
population above 55 (2010-30).

According to external consultant analysis, TMI’s Addressable Market is expected to grow at mid to
high single digit in the next five years.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading provider of HR solutions in key European staffing markets, offering end-to-end
temporary recruiting and outsourcing services. We supply specialized and niche staffing to primarily
small and medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) clients in a diversified range of end-markets. We offer and
tailor our services to the staffing needs of our clients through our engineering and consulting segment
and specialized talent solutions segment, which are comprised of a well-developed portfolio of ten
specialized business units, which we call Powerhouses, across various countries. We also offer digital
recruiting through our dedicated platforms, using our digital tools, including, NOWJOBS, SWOP and
Gighouse app, targeting low-skilled, high-volume markets with significant roll-out potential.

Since our founding, we have expanded from a presence in only Belgium to more than 10 countries in
Europe. Corresponding to our geographic expansion, we have also become more diversified in the endmarkets we serve, primarily through our acquisitions in recent years, which provide us with staffing
capabilities in additional areas such as pharmaceutical, healthcare, life sciences, government and public
administration and technology. As of September 30, 2022, we had 72,296 job candidates at work and
approximately 40,858 productive people at work (meaning the number of our job candidates adjusted
to reflect a 38 hour per week workweek) and 4,734 in-house full-time equivalent employees. For the
twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we had 31,456 unique clients, our Pro Forma Management
Adjusted Revenue was €2,770.0 million and our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA was_
€330.5 million.

Our engineering and consulting segment represents 53.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022. This segment supplies staffing of highly-skilled professionals, such as engineering
consultants and financial and insurance specialists, to fill specialized roles in a variety of end-markets,
such as financial, industrial, logistics, infrastructure, public administration and construction, and, more
recently, fast-evolving and highly resilient sectors such as energy, telecommunications,
pharmaceuticals and technology. This segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu Professionals,
Redmore, GRITT, Cohedron and SOLCOM Powerhouses and has the broadest geographic footprint,
with its primary operations in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The engineering and
consulting segment assists clients in the search and selection of the right candidate, including for interim
management and secondments, and such temporary client assignments generally last for months. The
below chart illustrates in blue the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for
our engineering and consulting segment.

Our specialized talent solutions segment represents 46.5% of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022. This segment supplies specialized staffing of high-demand mid-skilled workers
for specialized positions, such as clerical positions, carpenters, nurses and machine engineers, as well
as blue-collar workers to companies in certain sectors, including construction, retail, finance, food,
healthcare and construction. This segment is comprised of our Accent, Covebo, TIMEPARTNER and
TMI Powerhouses, with their primary operations in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as
branches in countries that form part of their international recruiting networks, which currently operate
principally for this segment though we are planning to expand them for our engineering and consulting
segment. These international branches provide us with the capability to source foreign candidates to
bridge the large gap between the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates,


-----

especially as the labor market in our Addressable Markets has tightened over the past few years. The
Specialized Talent Solution segment generally delivers job candidates through temporary agencies to
clients in a fast and flexible way when they are shorthanded, with duration of job placements typically
lasting for weeks, but they could also last hours or months depending on the needs of our clients. The
below chart illustrates in pink the type of client needs, worker qualifications and placement duration for
our Specialized Talent Solution segment.

We serve as an intermediary between job candidates and their ultimate employer by matching up
candidates that are looking to find a job, gain experience or find variety or flexibility with our clients
that are looking for specialist skills, flexible employee arrangements, time and cost efficiencies or to
cover peaks or sourcing for particular projects. We source and screen candidates, provide candidate
matching services and present candidates to the client. We also assist with the hiring of the candidates
by customers, client and candidate retention, provide timesheet, invoicing and payroll services, and
regularly follow up with clients. We aim to help our clients at all stages of the recruiting process to
relieve their management from the burden of having to seek appropriate job candidates for available
positions. To ensure that we are able to tap into skilled workforces, we offer career coaching to job
candidates in order to help them find career paths that align with their professional goals, and we provide
in-house training to equip them to match the job profiles in which they are interested or that are scarce
in the market to increase job candidates’ employability. We also offer support to foreign job candidates,
including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance.

We enter into employment contracts with the candidates and pay their salaries. We enter into placement
contracts with our clients and bill our clients for our services. Our bill-pay spread is a key driver of our
profitability and supports our industry-leading gross margins. We maximize bill-pay spread as a result
of candidate scarcity, our niche focus, our SME and local customer focus, our premium service offering,
our excellence in marketing candidates to jobs and non-solicitation or minimum fee/period protection
for candidates in respect of clients. We have strong pricing power driven by contractual dynamics that
ensure pass-through of salary increases. Our specialized talent solutions segment benefits from
contractual dynamics which allow for an automatic pass-through to clients of price increases, and our
business model also allows for limited bench risk because staffing contracts are back-to-back. In our
engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations with
our clients, and we effectively manage to keep our bench time low by matching confirmed upcoming
client assignments to candidates. The business model of these two segments has enabled us to establish
a track record of margin stability even during challenging economic conditions such as the Covid-19
pandemic and in the inflationary environment in 2022.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we generated 27.6%, 39.8%, 26.0% and 5.5% of our
_Pro Forma_ Management Adjusted Revenue in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France,
respectively. We have branches in the countries where we source job candidates, including Poland,
Romania, Spain, Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal. As of September 30, 2022, we had a network
of 742 branches and 18 recruitment offices. To complement our physical network of branches and reach
new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies, including our SWOP
application, our SWOP Recruiter application and our NOWJOBS platform. We have increased our
focus on developing digital support growth initiatives for our primary operations to enable us to reach
additional job candidates or serve new end-markets in a fully digital manner.


-----

We support businesses by providing flexible staffing solutions that are used throughout all stages of the
economic cycle, resulting in our resilience during economic downturns. While the economy is strong,
the job market tightens meaning that our clients need help sourcing candidates. As markets soften,
companies typically shift to a more temporary workforce and need staffing solutions and flexibility.
When markets reach the bottom of the cycle, temporary staffing suffers but then is characterized by a
quick recovery as temporary employment tends to recover faster than permanent employment. For
example, during the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, our business recovered from the early losses in
approximately three to six weeks. We also have a highly variable cost base and the ability to pass on
wage inflation, which supports the stability of our gross margins. For example, our Like-for-Like
Revenue growth (based on the December 31, 2021 perimeter) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 fluctuated
significantly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and were 2%, (9)% and 19%, respectively,
but we were able to maintain a gross margin of approximately 28% throughout this period. Flexible
staffing solutions proved instrumental in the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic,
resulting in a full recovery of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the Covid-19
pandemic, the retail, food retail and hospitality sectors were severely impacted across all our key
markets due to lockdowns and other restrictive measures, which led to a significant reduction in our
staffing activities in these sectors. Certain sectors, such as logistics and education, however, proved to
be less sensitive to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, and clients in these sectors continued to seek
our services, particularly for high-skilled, specialized roles. In addition, demand for staffing services
from municipalities and government agencies during the Covid-19 pandemic increased due to, among
other developments, work related to the administration of government support measures, which we were
able to capitalize on given our specialization in this end-market provided by the Cohedron Powerhouse
in our engineering and consulting segment.

We were founded in 1995 by Philip Cracco and Conny Vandendriessche along with a financial sponsor
as a Belgium-based recruiting firm. Originally called Accent, we changed our name to House of HR in
2012. Over the course of 2012 to 2014, Naxicap, a French private equity firm, acquired a majority stake
in our business, and we have expanded significantly to become a leading provider of specialized HR
solutions in multiple European markets. On November 3, 2022, Bain Capital acquired a majority stake
in the Group, with Naxicap, Conny Vandendriessche and management maintaining stakes. See “The
_Transactions.”_

**Our Strengths**

We believe we benefit from the following key strengths:

**_Operating in highly resilient markets with favorable tailwinds and structural demand dynamics_**

The HR solutions market has historically shown quick recovery in demand following periods of
economic downturns. The general temporary staffing market, as a whole, has a long-term positive GDP
growth trajectory and tends to recover quickly after an economic downturn. Within this market,
specialized staffing companies, like us, also benefit from higher resiliency than generalist staffing
companies that rely on the low value-add mass labor market. Specialized staffing companies benefit
from lower cyclicality compared to generalist staffing companies due to specialty profiles. Specialized
staffing companies also benefit from increased penetration with clients compared to generalist staffing
companies due to more clients in these specialized sectors turning to staffing solutions providers like
us to assist them with candidate searches and provide them with higher value-add solutions. The below
graph demonstrates the relative resilience of the specialist temporary staffing companies:


-----

____________________________
Note: Specialists include Alten, Amadeus, Assystem, Page and Robert Half, and Generalists include Adecco, Manpower, Randstad.

European Union and national regulations applicable in the key countries in which we operate tend to
reinforce protection of permanent workers, which can lead companies to favor temporary work and
outsourcing solutions as employers often prefer to hire on a more temporary basis before offering an
employee a permanent contract. This trend is especially evident in recovery periods after a trough in
the economic cycle as companies seek to scale up their workforce. For example, we were able to quickly
recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with our sales fully recovering to pre-Covid 19
levels during 2021. At the same time, legislation in the countries in which we principally operate allows
for multiple temporary staffing solutions, further supporting our business model.

We believe that high job vacancy rates offer us strong protection from a potential downturn in the nearterm as there would still be significant numbers of unfilled positions even with a reduction in vacancies,
which is similar to reductions that occurred during recent downturns. We offer our clients the ability to
recruit job candidates with specific profiles for jobs that are particularly difficult to fill, including from
abroad where needed, as we draw upon an international talent pool and provide required training. We
operate in markets where fundamentals for businesses such as ours are improving over time, supported
both by macroeconomic factors and positive structural demographic dynamics. Western Europe
generally is experiencing a large, chronic and growing supply and demand gap for skilled employees,
particularly related to technical engineering, specialized consulting and specialized blue-collar labor,
obliging companies to look beyond traditional job candidate sourcing and seek the help of specialized
staffing solutions providers like us. For example, unemployment rates in Germany were at 3.5% in
2021, as compared to 8.7% in 2007. In the Netherlands and Belgium, they were at 4.0% and 6.4%,
respectively, in 2021 as compared to a recent peak of 7.4% and 8.5%, respectively, in 2014. Job
vacancies in Belgium were at their highest in the second quarter of 2022 since 2012, and in Germany
and the Netherlands were at their highest in the second and third quarters of 2022, respectively, since
2007.

The staffing industry also benefits from a number of long-term underlying trends that have supported
our industry’s historical and projected medium- to long-term growth. Demand for the types of solutions
we provide is expected to continue growing in the future due to a number of positive secular trends,
including:

- Aging populations in our target markets and increasing competition for talent;

- Technological changes to job candidates’ search for employment opportunities, including the
switch to mobile technology, that are more challenging for employers to handle in-house;

- Workers increasingly prioritizing career mobility and focusing on smaller, entrepreneurial
opportunities;

- The need for workers to train or re-skill to adapt to changing work opportunities;


-----

- The desire of companies to address issues relating to diversity, inclusion and corporate social
responsibility;

- Workers placing an increased premium on quality of life and happiness at both a personal and
professional level, and an increased preference for job flexibility, especially since the Covid19 pandemic, leading to increased job rotation;

- Financial pressures resulting in increased outsourcing and offshoring; and

- Increasing use of artificial intelligence, data mining and robotization, as well as technological
change, all of which contribute to the skill supply-demand gap in labor markets.

- Especially for freelance workers, the prospect of better economics in spite of lower job security.

As a result of these secular trends, both employers and workers increasingly turn towards flexible
staffing models, driving demand for extended workforce solutions. According to an external consultant
analysis, in Belgium, Netherlands and France, the number of workers that are part of the extended
workforce (i.e., contractors and other freelancers) has grown from 2016 to 2021 at a CAGR of 3.9%,
2.5% and 4.4%, respectively. These growth rates are above those registered in the total working
population, which over the same period has grown at a CAGR of 1.0% in Belgium, 1.3% in the
Netherlands and 0.4% in France. This is also evidenced by the growth in penetration of the extended
workforce as part of the total workforce, with penetration rates in 2021 ranging from 7.2% in France to
10.2% in the Netherlands. We believe we are well positioned to capture penetration in specialized
extended labor.

These underlying trends contribute to the complexity of job searches and encourage companies to turn
to staffing solutions providers like us to help them fulfill their staffing needs. In addition, they make it
more challenging for new market entrants to effectively compete with established providers like us. We
have strategically positioned ourselves in geographic markets that are supported by macroeconomic
factors and positive demand dynamics in order to take full advantage of favorable trends. We believe
that the fundamentals of our Addressable Market remain strong in the medium-term and we believe that
we are poised to continue growing at or above the industry average growth rate in the future due to our
business model.

**_Increasingly diversified exposure to resilient and profitable end-markets targeting highly loyal and_**
**_less price-sensitive SME clients, with a focus on scarcity-driven specialist candidates_**

Our client focus is centered on SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises that require high-touch local
service and operate in specialty niches that are in high demand. This focus supports our above market
growth and margins and provides us resilience as a result of the critical nature of the positions sought
by our clients. We believe that SMEs represent a particularly attractive client base as they are generally
more loyal customers and are less price sensitive. SMEs tend to be more reliant on each employee and
have lower workforce anticipation capabilities than large corporates, so the absence of a single worker
can be critical. As a result, when they need to hire someone, they need someone fairly quickly and place
a premium on the ability to source job candidates within their time constraints. As SMEs may have
more limited or no in-house recruiting capabilities, they are more willing to outsource many of their
staffing-related needs to providers like us who can provide a full service offering at all stages of the
recruitment lifecycle. SMEs often have limited employer branding and therefore may experience
difficulty in reaching the best job candidates without access to the talent pool of a staffing solutions
provider. SMEs also often have a faster decision-making process compared to large corporates and lack
purchasing departments, so we may face less pricing pressure from such companies. In addition, SMEs,
due to the smaller size of their employee pools, are less likely to lay off workers in a downturn and
typically maintain a more consistent level of employment than larger companies during a downturn.
The stability of employee levels at SMEs was evident during the global financial crisis as, based on
information from Accent, employment volumes were resilient at small companies and demonstrated
growth from 2008 to 2016.


-----

We have a track record of serving the attractive SME segment, with a focus on scarcity-driven specialist
candidates. We believe that the ability to find a specific candidate with the right cultural fit is important
for SMEs, since they typically have small teams and often seek a particular candidate who is not only
qualified for the job, but also matches the client’s corporate culture. Our ability to match such job
candidates results from our blend of human and digital touchpoints, with regular interaction with clients
and job candidates throughout the recruitment lifecycle (including our international recruiting
capabilities). HR staffing solutions also operate in a complex regulatory environment, and we provide
our clients with the required specific knowledge by sector, geography and even region. We believe the
ability to manage this complexity on a large scale increases the barriers to entry for the sector and
diminishes the risk for digital disruption or disintermediation.

In addition to our focus on SMEs, we focus on specialist candidates, which provides further resilience
to our business as skilled jobs are less cyclical. For example, in France, the unemployment rate for
unskilled jobs has had an approximately 8% variation between 2000 and 2020 as compared to a rate of
approximately 2% for skilled workers as demonstrated by the chart below.

Note: Based on France. Skilled works are defined as those with two years of post-high school diploma education (baccalaureate) and unskilled
workers are defined as those who hold no diploma

In particular, we focus on specialty niches that are in high demand and that support higher revenue
growth and margins than generalist staffing. We market our services under brands that relate to specific
specialized services offered by our Powerhouses or sub business-unit or brands under a Powerhouse,
which we call Boutiques. Our multiple brand approach has proven effective in attracting and retaining
clients and candidates. For example, our Facebook page of Accent currently has, in most instances,
almost twice the number of followers (61.0K) than the Facebook pages of our competitors Randstad
Belgium (27.0K), RGF Staffing (Start People) (35.0K) or Adecco Belgium (39.0K) as of November
2022.

We also benefit from having diversified our business activities towards more resilient end-markets and
job candidate profiles. Our new business structure is reflective of our strategy, which is geared towards


-----

moving away from general staffing to a more specialized staffing focus. For the year ended December
31, 2018, our business mix included more of a focus on general staffing, with 15% of our Pro Forma
Management Adjusted EBITDA coming from our general staffing segment, 46% from our engineering
and consulting segment and 39% from our specialized staffing segment (based on our consolidation
perimeter for 2018) whereas for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 53.5% of our Pro Forma
Management Adjusted EBITDA (excluding corporate costs and intragroup eliminations) was
attributable to our engineering and consulting segment and 46.5% was attributable to our specialized
talent solution segment (which includes general staffing). We also have actively increased our endmarket mix to focus on public sector, IT and telecommunications, healthcare, food and financial and
legal end-markets, which are more resilient throughout the economic cycle. The below chart shows our
revenue for the year ended December 2018 by end-market compared to our Pro Forma Management
Adjusted Revenue by end-market for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Through our business segments and brands in our core geographies, we provide HR solutions that meet
most of the critical job shortages in those markets. Our focus on niche and specialty staffing highlights
the added value we can provide to companies looking for specific job candidate profiles which are often
difficult to find, and in our experience, clients are willing to attach a premium to such services. Our
focus on niche and specialty staffing also enables us to recruit and retain qualified job candidates. Even
when we serve large corporate clients, we believe our provision of specialized staffing solutions enables
us to maintain pricing power as a result of the quality of and demand for our job candidates.

We believe that our geographic footprint, branch density and our ability to recruit internationally are
challenging to replicate and are essential to fostering the client relationships and granular geographic
reach necessary to reach our targeted SME and specialty-focused clients. We maintain and have access
to a large database of job candidates to enable short matching times and have acquired in-depth end

-----

market experience through selective organic and external growth over many years, which facilitates our
ability to source, match and retain job candidates and clients in our key markets.

**_Outstanding performance throughout the cycle demonstrating highly resilient profile_**

We have grown our business over recent years both organically and through targeted, strategic and
value-accretive acquisitions. From 2008 to 2021, our Like-for-Like Revenue grew at a compound
annual growth rate of 7.8%. We believe that our largely consistent positive Like-for-Like Revenue
growth in each business segment and for the pro forma perimeter outperforms the market and evidences
the success of our differentiated business model. In addition, we achieved Organic Growth of 19.9% in
the year ended December 31, 2021, and 17.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our Likefor-Like Revenue growth across the various stages of the economic cycle from 2008 demonstrates the
resilience of our revenues and our ability to recover from economic downturns at a more rapid rate than
GDP. We have been able to maintain strong EBITDA margins even through challenging
macroeconomic conditions. The chart below portrays our Like-for-Like Revenue growth from 2008 to
the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 showing our organic and external growth and our
EBITDA margins, including the unaudited business unit accounts of Accent, as well as those of our
other business units, on the basis as described in the notes below.

past due diligence reports and management analysis. The total amounts include corporate costs. Although we believe the underlying materials
used and the basis of preparation to be reasonable, actual results may vary from the indicative information presented above, in particular due
to different accounting bases of preparation, and such variations could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on the

We have been able to navigate through crises by sustaining high levels of organic growth across cycles,
including during the global financial crisis in 2008 and the Covid-19 pandemic, demonstrating the

resilience of our business model. The below graph illustrates our Like-for-Like Revenue growth across
the various economic cycles.

We also have a strong track record of external growth through highly accretive acquisitions in a
fragmented market. We approach our growth through acquisitions with rigorous discipline. We focus
on acquiring successful, profitable companies rather than turn-around acquisitions. Our evaluation of a
potential acquisition target includes reviewing the opportunity through the rubric of a number of
stringent requirements designed to ensure fit with our overall strategy and culture. The target must fit
an identified strategic need to expand our geographic coverage, complement a specific specialty or fill
a niche skill gap. We also seek out targets with like-minded management teams with an entrepreneurial
spirit and long-term commitment in order to ensure a strong overall cultural fit. We also evaluate the
target’s profitability, historic growth and other performance metrics, and assess whether it is a leader in
its addressable markets. Once we have identified and then acquired a target, we have a well-defined and
proven integration process that involves consolidating the target into our Group reporting system and
sharing best practices. Local management teams are given the opportunity to invest at group level or to
continue to invest at the local level. We have completed 42 transactions since 2018, comprised of bolton acquisitions with lower multiples that enable growth at the local level, as well as platform
acquisitions through which we expand our solutions and enter new specialties or markets. We have an
excellent integration track record with our targets’ EBITDA and revenue growing by approximately 8%
per annum and 10% on average after we integrated them, as demonstrated by our acquisitions of
Abylsen, Covebo, Continu, TIMEPARTNER and Redmore. See “—Engineering and Consulting” and
“—Specialized Talent Solutions.”

**_Reference player in target markets with proven track record of above-market performance delivering_**
**_higher margins driven by highly incentivized management team_**

We occupy leading positions across the highly fragmented markets in which we operate. Many of our
operating companies are reference players within their respective specialty, benefiting from the virtuous
cycle of competitive leadership, with their track record, enabling them to capture a high percentage of
their market growth and benefiting from brand loyalty and pricing power as a result. The table below
shows our relative market positioning vis-à-vis our peers:

(2) For each peer, based on a numerical mean of latest publicly available EBITDA margin (post IFRS-16) as a percentage and with
respect to House of HR, based on the results of operation for 2021.

Based on Net Promoter Scores, we are the most recommended HR solutions provider by customers in
the Netherlands and second most recommended HR solutions provider by SME customers in Belgium.
In addition, based on Google reviews, we are the most recommended HR solutions provider by job
candidate in Belgium and second most recommended HR solutions provider by job candidates in the
Netherlands. Our clients make staffing decisions at a local level and our large footprint with high branch
density allows us to be physically present in the communities where our clients operate, meaning that
clients have a familiarity with our brand at a local level, which provides a key competitive advantage
for us.

We believe we are unique among our peers and that this is reflected in our performance compared to
certain of our competitors. Our Like-for-Like Revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 8% from 2008 to 2021 (based on our 2020 consolidation perimeter excluding avanti,
Cohedron, SOLCOM and TMI and including Solyne and Greenworking) as compared to the Organic
Growth average (weighted by business mix) of our peer benchmark, including Adecco, Randstad and
Alten, which grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% during the same period. In
addition, we have a track record of significant growth above market, with nominal GDP growing at
annual compound growth rate of approximately 1% from 2008 to 2021 (based on the nominal GDP
growth for the Eurozone) and the volume of the number of temporary workers (based on a weighted
average of publicly available information in Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands) having a
negative annual compound growth rate during the same period. We also enjoyed best-in-class
profitability compared to our specialist and generalist peers. This is demonstrated by the below chart
comparing our EBITDA margins on a total basis, for our engineering and consulting segment and for
our specialized staffing solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the EBITDA
margins of some of our specialist and generalist peers for the same period.

We believe our above-market performance is driven by our strong entrepreneurial culture and local
incentivization model. We operate on a strong incentivization model with fast promotion opportunities,
including opportunities to open new branches where a manager generates new business. Our variable
bonus systems are intended to encourage growth and bonuses as we do not have bonus caps. Variable
pay can represent up to 50% of the salary package for our employees, including the management of our
business units, branch managers, sales consultants and recruitment consultants. The below chart
illustrates the potential pay for one of our account managers on a base salary of €33,000 as compared
to an account manager on a base salary of €35,000 at one of our competitors, which demonstrates the
additional opportunities provided by us.

We believe our model encourages winning behaviors from our employees, driven by an owner mindset.
We have highly invested top-level and mid-level managers, with 412 managers having reinvested
approximately 63% of the net proceeds received from the Acquisition in the new structure, which
confirms their belief in House of HR and our business model. Including new joiners, currently
approximately 500 members of management are invested in the company. Such investment encourages
employees to focus on building relationships, both with clients and candidates, which helps to support
our performance. We also typically offer an appealing value proposition to managers of the businesses
we acquire by allowing these individuals to retain autonomy over their respective entities’ operations,
including brand and identity, while allowing them to benefit from central support on complex regulatory
and compliance topics, access to our foreign sourcing network and digital platforms and access to our
financing. We also offer such managers an incentive structure tied to, where possible, both their own
company’s and our overall results. We believe that this streamlines the integration process and helps to
align the management of our acquisition targets with our central management. Together with the support
of our new sponsor, Bain Capital, we replaced our long-term incentive plan, which was settled on or
about the Acquisition Closing Date, with a new one on the Acquisition Closing Date in order to maintain
our culture of incentivization and increase employee commitment and engagement. We also believe
that our long-term incentive plan allows for succession planning for key roles by incentivizing key staff


-----

to remain with the business and by enabling potential reinvestments in the equity of House of HR going
forward.

**_Ability to pass through wage increases to customers, including through automatic contractual_**
**_mechanisms, and stable margins_**

We have the ability to pass through wage increases from inflation to customers in both our engineering
and consulting segment and our specialized talent solutions segment, which, coupled with our flexible
cost structure, has resulted in resilient gross margins. While our gross margins in both of our segments
fluctuate somewhat as a result of seasonality around holiday periods, they have remained largely stable
since January 2019 at approximately 22% to 28% (depending on Powerhouses and specialties) for our
specialized talent solutions segment and approximately 30% to 37% for our engineering and consulting
segment. Our revenues typically correlate with nominal GDP rather than real GDP due to our ability to
pass through wage increases in an inflationary environment and stable margins.

In our specialized talent solutions segment, price increases are automatically passed through to our
clients. For this segment, our contract model is centered on matching the length of our candidate’s
employment contract with us to the length of our placement contract with our client, the ultimate
employer, in order to prevent lag time between inflation of gross salary paid to the candidate and the
cost we charge to our clients, which results in an automatic pass-through of any salary increases. As
contracts expire, we renegotiate them, which has historically resulted in an ability to increase our prices
in line with wage inflation. We base our contract pricing on a candidate’s gross salary multiplied by a
coefficient factor, with the split typically being transparent to the client. Our coefficient factors tend to
remain relatively stable with slight fluctuations as a result of seasonality around holiday periods. For
example, Accent’s coefficient factor has remained relatively stable since 2020 at an average of 2.2.

The key pricing drivers for the coefficient factor are the scarcity of candidates and the value of any
additional services we offer. Key costs for us include salaries and work accident insurance. At the end
of the contract period, typically one week or one month in length, if salary increases, then we charge
the cost of the higher salary to the client. During the first half of 2022, we achieved average price
increases of approximately 5.0% (calculated as the numerical mean of the average price increases across
certain Powerhouses, weighted equally). Growth in euro-per-hour billed in our specialized talent
solutions segment is driven by increasing cost per hour paid and billed, as well as through increasing
bench costs. Our gross margin per hour billed remained highly stable at approximately 23% to 25%
(including bench costs) and approximately 29% to 30% (excluding bench costs) for each of the nine
months ended September 30, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as shown in the below chart.

1 Excluding Atrium and BE-Consult given ongoing integration.


-----

In our engineering and consulting segment, price increases are typically passed through via negotiations
with clients. The contracts are typically time and material contracts with no obligations for any specific
result. Most of our candidates in our engineering and consulting segment are permanently hired by us
using employment contracts that typically have three- to six-week notice periods. We have placement
contracts with our clients that typically last nine to twelve months, which allows us to effectively
manage bench time and match our candidates with the upcoming mandates from clients. In most cases,
we plan for salary increases in advance and negotiate rate increases with our clients accordingly. Our
pricing model in our engineering and consulting segment centers on charging the client an hourly or
daily rate. Our billing rate is typically based on an hourly wage and a mark-up where the split is usually
not transparent to clients. Since 2021, we have been able to consistently increase our hourly rate in this
segment. For example, at Talent&Pro, one of our Redmore Boutiques that focuses on the finance
industry staffing, although our hourly rate fluctuated between €46.8 and €48.1 per hour during the
course of 2020, by the end of December 2021 we were able to increase it to approximately €49.6, and
have continued to increase it during the course of 2022, with an hourly rate of €53.5 as of September
2022.

Key drivers of the hourly or daily rates are skills, seniority and scarcity of candidates. Our key costs
include salary, potentially including a company car. At the end of a placement contract, renewal either
entails replacing the candidate with a new or more junior person at a new price or placing the same
candidate, who is now more senior, at a higher price. During the first half of 2022, we achieved average
price increases of approximately 6.6% (calculated as the numerical mean of the average price increases
across certain Powerhouses, weighted equally). Margin growth in our engineering and consulting
segment is driven by increasing the cost per hour paid and billed. Bench-time risk is effectively managed
by matching confirmed upcoming client assignments to candidates. Our gross margin per hour billed in
this segment also remained stable at approximately 32% to 34% (including bench costs) and
approximately 45% to 47% (excluding bench costs) for each of the nine months ended September 30,
2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.

**_Robust financial profile supports cash generation with a highly variable cost base and proven ability_**
**_to deleverage_**

Our business model has supported strong EBITDA growth and profitability. We demonstrated our
financial resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic with strong EBITDA margins of 11%, 10% and 12%
for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and 11% for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively. We have limited capital expenditure requirements (primarily related


-----

to IT investments and expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles,
primarily related to our headquarters, furniture and infrastructure for our branch network,
accommodation for foreign job candidates, company cars) of approximately 1% of revenue in each of
2019, 2020 and 2021. As our key assets are the talent we provide to meet the temporary staffing needs
of our clients, we have limited fixed assets or cash tied up in inventory. Working capital largely consists
of receivables (client billings) and payables (job candidate wages, social security, etc.) tied to individual
job candidate placements. The receivable for each job candidate placement is typically higher than the
payable with the difference roughly representing the bill-pay spread or gross margin embedded in the
client service agreement and job candidate agreement. Working capital as a percentage of sales for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2022, was 4.9% of sales, compared to 2.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The working capital dynamics and corresponding downside protection for our cash
flows are also evident in our recent performance. As volumes of job candidates reduce, for instance,
during period of economic downturns, we benefit from significant working capital inflows, which gives
us strong cash resiliency. In 2020, we experienced a positive change in working capital demonstrating
the counter-cyclical nature of our working capital profile. As a result, we experience high cash
conversion and cash flow growth, which has, in turn, supported our business growth, and has in the
past, allowed us to deleverage on a net debt basis following each of our refinancings. The following
chart shows our Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow and our Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow as a percentage of EBITDA
cash for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

We also benefit from a flexible cost structure, with approximately 95% of our costs being variable or
semi-variable allowing for highly stable gross margins through the cycle. For 2021, approximately
65.1% of our total operating expenses were variable, 31.7% were semi-variable and 3.2% were fixed
costs. Our cost of services, which represented 79.1% of our total operational expenses (cost of services
and operating expenses together) for the year ended December 31, 2021, is comprised of mostly variable
costs related to our people at work (mainly payroll, social security contributions, housing, car fleet and
subcontracting costs). Our direct costs linked to our branches are primarily semi-variable and include
staff costs, including costs of managers and recruiters, and branch expenses, such as rents, car leases
and training, marketing and communication costs. Our overheads related to corporate functions at both
an operating company and Group-level, which represented less than 5% of our total operating expenses,
consists primarily of fixed costs. Further, due to our back-to-back contract model, we experience limited
bench risk in respect of people at work. In many of our jurisdictions, we are able to match the duration
of the employment of our job candidates and their placement, allowing us to be flexible in the
deployment of our job candidate resources. As costs generally track revenue, costs of service as a
percentage of revenue, and as a result, our margins, generally remain stable during downturns, as
demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic.

**_We are well-protected from disruption by other digital players and have developed an emerging_**
**_platform for excellent proprietary digital offering_**

We have an excellent proprietary digital offering and based on interviews with market participants we
believe we are well-protected from disruption from typical digital players that focus on a low-skilled,
higher volume business. We believe we are differentiated from such market participants because our
core offering is focused on specialty staffing and focused on SMEs that require customized services,
which are much more difficult to standardize or automate.

We believe that we are a thought leader and ahead of our larger peers in many respects as a result of
our development of digital initiatives in order to both address new markets with innovative business
models and improve our own and existing operations. To complement our physical network of branches
and reach new markets, we have pioneered several successful disruptor technologies that are revenuegenerating. Our NOWJOBS platform, which successfully competes in the low-skill, higher volume
segment, is primarily geared to students and other seekers of one-off temporary jobs, and is to date our
most successful digital initiative. Originally just available in Belgium where it launched in 2017, we
launched NOWJOBS in the Netherlands in 2019, in France in 2021 and in Germany in June 2022,
bringing on board big customers such as retail brands H&M and Picnic. For the year ended December
31, 2021, NOWJOBS handled approximately 1.1 billion requests and generated €54.1 million, €1.9
million and €0.2 million in revenues in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, respectively. Following
our acquisition of StaffMe in July 2022, NOWJOBS will operate under the StaffMe brand in France
given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country. In addition, we launched our SWOP
Recruiter application in May 2021, which is a free digital platform that helps Belgian SMEs with the
day-to-day management of their vacancies. The application is linked to our SWOP application, which
we launched in 2016 and further upgraded in 2020, and is now one of the largest Belgian apps to help
job seekers find a new permanent job. We launched SWOP in the Netherlands in October 2022 and plan
to launch SWOP in Germany in the near future. Our Gighouse app is a digital platform that matches
freelancers and independent job candidates with available projects at our customers. We aim to leverage
our experience as a disruptor in the market to expand successful initiatives to our broader Group.

In addition, we have also developed a number of complementary digital offerings that supplement our
core services. For example, in June 2019, we launched our MyAccent app, which allows potential job
candidates to interact via the Google Home assistant with Accent’s list of open positions. Book’u is our
planning tool, allowing customers to plan both their permanent and temporary workforce in one
solution, being in touch with this workforce to communicate when they should be available and
allowing to spot potential staffing shortages, immediately posting these shortages at their staffing
companies of choice. My Talents (Softskillz) testing has been developed together with the University
of Ghent, to test ‘who you are’ as a person and to test ‘what type of company do I want to work for.’
These tests will allow for better AI matching of jobs with candidates. Continu-Connect, which launched
in 2021 and had 756 registered contacts as of December 31, 2021, shows all available candidates in a
region for our customers. Our FYGI app brings together freelance HR recruiters with companies that
have a recruitment request. We have also other apps and platforms that assist with the recruitment and
other staffing processes, such as Dora, Ariad and CV Creator. All apps are developed taking into
account reusability across all House of HR operating companies, benefitting therefore from the
economies of scale House of HR has versus local competitors and increasing the barriers to entry for
our industry.

During 2021, we centralized all our digital assets in House of Invest, creating one platform to meet
current needs and invest in new needs as they arise. This enabled us to further invest in our digital
roadmap and internationalize our digital initiatives, bringing our digital and IT talents together to work
on multiple digital solutions. The main purpose of House of Invest is to roll out the digital initiatives
across all House of HR Powerhouses and Boutiques and to capitalize on a centralized knowledge base.
House of Invest now owns NOWJOBS, Gighouse, SWOP and SWOP Recruiter, Continu-Connect, CV
creator and My Talents (Softskillz), and holds minority ownerships in Dora and Ariad (a traditional
digital marketing staffing company) and a majority ownership in Book’u.


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from digital solutions amounted to 2.6% of total
revenue, compared to 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have continued investing in IT
in 2022 and expect to continue prioritizing the digital venue going forward. We believe our digital
offering protects us from disruptions from digital players who focus on low-skilled, high volume
business, while our platforms continue to focus on high-skilled job candidates with a focus on SMEs.

We are also continuing to innovate our existing processes by identifying areas within our business that
could benefit from increased automation and zero-paper processes, including both job candidate- and
client-facing and internal processes, such as finance, procurement and marketing and communications.
Further, we continue to digitalize our processes and create a centralized repository designed to store,
process and secure large amounts of data across our different applications, which will enhance our
access to job candidates and improve our matching capabilities. We believe the efficiencies we can
realize through this digitalization will produce cost savings while allowing us to meet the everincreasing demands of clients and job candidates.

**_Entrepreneurial and invested management team with long-term incentive culture backed by a new,_**
**_highly supportive shareholder with deep industry knowledge_**

We benefit from a strong and committed management team that is highly motivated to deliver strong
performance over the long term. We believe our successful organic and external growth has been due
in part to the way in which we have been able to incentivize our managers. For example, our organic
“cell division” expansion strategy rewards our local managers with the opportunity to create and run
individual branches, fostering loyalty and encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit that has delivered our
success to date. For our engineering and consulting branches, our variable pay structure rewards
management down to the sales and recruitment consultants with variable pay linked to key performance
indicators such as attracting, matching and retaining job candidates and clients. While keeping a highly
entrepreneurial culture at the Powerhouse and Boutique levels, all strategic decisions with a significant
impact are made at House of HR level, and our local business units share in the centralized corporate
support and institutional knowledge.

We now also benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of
our new shareholder, Bain Capital. Bain Capital has a strong track record of investing in the business
services space with over 50 current or past investments. Bain Capital has invested in businesses in the
staffing and engineering consulting services, including Quest, a leading global engineering services
provider, MSX International, a BPO company focused on technical staffing solutions and managed
services, Inetum, an IT services provider in France, and Engineering, an IT systems and services
provider in Italy, as well as other investments in the business services space, including Autodistribution
and Bravida. Following the Acquisition, our management continues to remain invested in the equity of
the Group, having reinvested approximately 63% of the net proceeds received from the Acquisition in
the Group, totaling approximately €255.0 million, or between 20% to 25% of ownership of the Group.

**Our Strategies**

We and the Sponsor have developed the following strategies:

**_Make use of our agile, decentralized operating model to further focus on organic growth by grasping_**
**_additional market share while maintaining best-in-class profitability_**

Over the years, we have been highly successful in achieving incremental organic revenue growth under
our “cell division” approach in our specialized talents solutions segment as clients are mostly SMEs
who require high touch local services. In most of our markets, we expect to continue our strategy of
embedding ourselves in local communities through an extensive branch network. While our primary
operations are in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, we have branches spread across
countries where we source job candidates. Our international recruiting network is key for our ability to
attract and retain job candidates for assignments in sectors where candidates are scarce. Our
decentralized structure places our Powerhouses and Boutiques in proximity to our primary stakeholders:


-----

our clients, our job candidates and our own employees, which allows us to gain local market knowledge,
understand local competition and remain informed of local staffing trends. In order to continue to grow,
we intend to expand our branch network where needed and to continue to leverage our success in
sourcing and retaining job candidates, focusing on those job profiles which are and will be increasingly
scarce in the market. We also believe our extensive branch network approach leads to enhanced
entrepreneurship and ownership due to the managerial responsibilities and opportunities allocated or
available to branch managers, reinforcing a key part of our values.

We also intend to continue to focus on, and leverage our positive track record in, our engineering and
consulting and specialized talent solutions segments to continue growing profitably. We have gradually
shifted our focus toward the engineering and consulting and specialized staffing model and away from
general staffing, benefiting from our growing network in the transition to deliver higher margins. The
specialized staffing and engineering and consulting segments tend to deliver higher margins than
general staffing due to the premium clients place on successful placement of the specific job candidates
that they seek. Specialization in turn aims to target those segments and skills that are more difficult to
find for our customers, which in the past has provided more stability to our revenue figures and
protected our margins, including during economic downturns. We further aim to deliver continued
improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin through efficient cost control over operating expense and
strong cash conversion with rigorous management of capital expenditures and working capital.

We believe our agile organization and increased specialization will continue to promote flexibility for
our Powerhouses and Boutiques to refine recruitment approaches and conduct day-to-day activities that
best meet their respective local business needs and enable us to offer clients tailored staffing services.
We believe this will continue to translate into higher market penetration and additional market share to
propel our organic growth, as well as our ability to effectively staff specialized jobs that drive our bestin-class profitability given the scarcity and complexity of the job profiles we match.

**_Enhance our reputation as the partner of choice for SMEs and locally managed clients_**

We intend to continue providing critical end-to-end temporary recruiting and outsourcing services that
are tailored to the needs of SMEs and other locally-managed clients. We believe that in the future these
clients, in both our engineering and consulting segment and specialized talent solutions segment, will
continue to require the assistance of providers like us primarily for temporary HR solutions as they
grapple with limited resources, lower visibility on staffing needs and greater need for outsourced HR
functions, including as a result of the complexity of labor law and associated regulations. As the partner
of choice for our SMEs and locally managed clients, we are experienced in accommodating unique and
time-sensitive client demands, including matching specialized, “mission-critical” profiles for our clients
in the engineering and consulting segment that typically last for months, or deploying a large number
of blue-collar workers at short notice for our clients in the specialized talent solutions segment that often
last for weeks or sometimes just hours as the situations require. We plan to continue focusing on being
the partner of choice for SMEs and locally managed clients by leveraging the large pool of potential
job candidates at our disposal and the deep end-market knowledge we have gathered over the years by
having boots on the ground in proximity to our clients.

**_Ensure the smooth and profitable placement of job candidates with a reliable sourcing and reskilling_**
**_platform_**

Mastering the “human” aspect of human resources is key to success in our industry, and we intend to
continue to be a leader through our focus on being able to source the right job candidate for the right
position, including through offering reskilling services. We believe that our network of international
sourcing of job candidates is vital to our success, as we are better able to bridge the large gap between
the demand for qualified job candidates and the supply of such candidates, especially as the labor market
in our Addressable Market has tightened over the past few years, through having access to a wider pool
of quality job candidates than our peers. The location of our agencies (particularly in Poland, Romania,
Spain, the Czech Republic, Moldova and Portugal) and the support we offer to foreign job candidates


-----

(including housing, transport options, opening a bank account and other integration assistance) ensures
that we are able to tap into workforces that are skilled but that are eager to seek out opportunities to
earn higher wages than those that similar work would provide in their home countries. We intend to
continue to develop our network in other countries that meet these criteria. We also plan to continue
leveraging our large sourcing network to target the best job candidates and provide them with a wide
array of positions and support, including in-house training that equips them with skillsets that match
the profiles that our clients look for, administrative support, client knowledge and even transport and
housing for foreign job candidates to make their experience as smooth as possible. Finally, we plan to
focus on preparing job candidates for what we see as the jobs of tomorrow, such as white-collar
positions in big data and information technology, that are being driven by the digitalization of the
economy or provide training in order to teach blue-collar job candidates how to use digital tools.

**_Utilize digital initiatives to reduce cost and drive revenue diversification_**

Our digital strategy is focused on maximizing the impact of digital cost reduction initiatives, outpacing
smaller competitors who have more limited investment capabilities and opening new market segments.
In the near-term, we want to leverage digital tools to complement our physical networks to attract job
candidates and clients while also spreading awareness of our brands and services. We also intend to
continue digitalizing our processes to drive efficiency. For example, SWOP, our free digital sourcing
platform that assists SMEs with day-to-day management of their vacancies, strengthens our sourcing
capability and supplements the activities of our revenue-generating business units, such as NOWJOBS,
which facilitates the actual matching of job candidates with clients.

Over the longer term, we intend to pursue a four-pillared digital strategy. First, we aim to reposition the
offices we have in urban areas into “JobShops” that are easy to reach, convenient, one-stop shops where
job candidates can be tested, get certifications and be matched with potential positions through our
digital platforms that require limited involvement of our recruiting consultants. We also are continuing
to develop niche, specialized digital platforms that are tailored to meet the specific demands of the
various markets we address. Furthermore, we intend to utilize the data that we have generated through
our large network to deliver the best possible client and job candidate service through our candidate
data platform. For example, we are currently developing Mission Akira, a data-driven tool that helps to
train our consultants on the kind of information that they should ask candidates for in order to better
prepare them for placement. We are also developing a client version of the ‘Who do I want to work for’
test, which indicates the type of job candidates that fit best with a particular team leader, and the ‘My
brains’ test which attempts to indicate the intelligence level of a job candidate within their education
level. We also plan to develop more automated processes to free up our recruiting consultants’ time for
them to focus on growing ever closer to our client and job candidate base and gather the right
information that will lead to faster and better matching.

As part of our digital strategy, we are in the process of rolling out our digital platforms internationally
to enable us to get more structured and accurate information from job candidates, so we can match them
with the right clients in a more effective and flexible manner, which we believe will help introduce
brand loyalty and help us with client and job candidates retention. For example, NOWJOBS was first
launched in Belgium in 2017, and it was subsequently launched in the Netherlands in 2019, in France
in 2021 and most recently in Germany in 2022. We also acquired StaffMe in July 2022, a French digital
platform focusing on student employment and which is primarily active in the retail, health event and
hospitality sectors, supplementing our NOWJOBS offering. Through this acquisition, we also acquired
the other companies of the StaffMe group, including the StaffMe Academy, the first training
organization for young entrepreneurs, and the Accelerator, a program of integration through selfemployment for those who are far from employment. NOWJOBS will operate under the StaffMe brand
in France given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country. We plan to continue to
develop our other digital platforms and roll them out beyond their current markets.


-----

**_Continue to target accretive acquisition opportunities to achieve European leadership_**

While our primary focus is to grow our earnings base organically and to improve both profitability and
Pre-Tax Free Cash Flow generation through our existing network and customer base, we will continue
to consider accretive and strategic platform and bolt-on acquisitions in both new and existing markets
to achieve our goal of European leadership. We do not consider acquisition opportunities aimed at
turning around a business, but only will consider opportunities that can reinforce our market positions
or expand our footprint, either in new geographical regions or niche areas in which we currently are not
present and that exhibit the following attributes: stable economies with low unemployment, high salary
level, high temporary staff penetration, a stable regulatory environment and supply and demand
mismatch for skilled labor. We will continue to focus on acquisitions of highly specialized businesses
(such as IT, legal and finance), business focusing on bottleneck jobs and engineering and consulting
services. We will also consider opportunities in digital tools that can improve the value chain or allow
us to better serve job candidates as well as clients and to develop new and complementary segments
that are also marked by labor market scarcity or that can demonstrate the prospect for high growth and
superior margins. We will continue to use our M&A assessment criteria, which requires that any
opportunity meets our own high quality standards, holds a leading position in its respective specialized
end-market, reflects a strong financial profile and represents a good cultural fit with us. While we
historically have focused on bolt-on acquisitions that can enhance our network and/or provide us with
exposure to complementary sectors of the economy, we also occasionally consider larger acquisitions
that are otherwise consistent with our investment criteria. We are also targeting, in particular, certain
new end-markets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals and new geographic markets such as the
Nordic countries and other countries, such as Austria and Switzerland.

**Our History**

We were founded in 1995 by Philip Cracco and Conny Vandendriessche along with a financial sponsor
as Accent, a Belgium-based recruiting firm. We acquired Logi-technic in 2009 and Bekaert Technics
in 2010, expanding our operations within Belgium.

Over the course of 2012 to 2014, Naxicap, a French private equity firm, acquired a majority stake in
our business, and we have expanded significantly to become a leading provider of specialized HR
solutions in multiple European markets. Our business made its first cross-border acquisition in March
2015, acquiring the French staffing firm Abylsen, which became one of our Powerhouses and seconds
engineers through multiple offices across France, Belgium and Switzerland. From 2015, our expansion
accelerated through Organic Growth and through acquisitions, starting with two other major
acquisitions in 2015, which have since become Powerhouses: Covebo, a Dutch specialized temporary
staffing company sourcing Polish workers through a network in Poland and the Netherlands, and
Continu Professionals, a Dutch professional staffing company seconding white-collar technical
professionals in the construction, civil and industrial engineering end-markets. We have since acquired
firms that have become other Powerhouses of our Group, such as Redmore, GRITT, TIMEPARTNER,
Cohedron, SOLCOM and TMI. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Acquisitions, Disposals and the Comparability of our Financial_
_Statements” for further information on our acquisitions._

In 2018, we implemented a legal reorganization which was completed in January 2019, as a result of
which our holding companies, House of HR NV and The House of Pledge NV, hold 100% of the equity
interests in each of the top entities associated with the Group’s ten Powerhouses (except for Abylsen,
which is held by Accent). We had historically structured our business across three segments:
engineering and consulting, specialized staffing and general staffing. In 2021, we integrated our legacy
specialized staffing and general staffing segments into the current specialized talent solutions segment,
and we now categorize our ten Powerhouses into one of the two staffing segments: engineering and
consulting and specialized talent solutions, which are also the Group’s financial reporting segments.


-----

On May 28, 2022, Bain Capital entered into the Acquisition Agreement to acquire a majority stake in
the Group. The Acquisition was completed on November 3, 2022. See “Summary—The Transactions”
for further details.

**Our Business Model**

Our business units serve as the intermediaries between job candidates (supply) and the client requiring
staffing solutions (demand). Our in-house employees include sales, marketing and recruiting staff, who
work to attract job candidates to our business units and to maintain and build new client relationships
with those who have HR staffing needs. Our in-house employees match job candidates to the HR needs
of our clients. Some of our business units also screen and recruit freelancers, particularly in specialist
areas with high job shortages or where flexible work arrangements are preferred, and certain of our
business units also engage in search and selection services in order to recruit highly specialized job
candidates. We refer to “job candidates” as those individuals that we recruit or who come to us seeking
work and who are placed with clients. Job candidates include blue-collar and white-collar temporary
workers, consultants and engineers in our engineering and consulting segment, as well as freelancers
that are placed with clients by us. The following charts show our job candidates at work at the times
indicated therein as a group and by segment.

Price analysis excludes TMI, Cohedron, Bis people, LD Personalvermittlung, StaffMe, Fid, Agium and ABMI.

Sickness impacts our number of job candidates at work. The following chart shows the percentage of
our job candidates that were sick at the times indicated therein.

We will typically enter into an employment agreement with the job candidate and a service agreement
with the client. The employment agreement is often entered into with the job candidate in connection
with us entering into a service agreement with the client. In these cases, the employment agreement is
for the duration of a particular client assignment, which duration will vary a great deal among our
business units due to the nature of the services offered and will also be impacted by the nature of the
services required by the client. In a number of our business units, in particular those in our engineering
and consulting segment, the employment agreement will often be an indefinite employment agreement
and for a longer duration than the service agreement with the client as a result of regulatory reasons or
to facilitate recruiting job candidates.


-----

Nearly all of the service agreements into which we enter with clients are time and materials service
agreements, which means we are compensated under the contract for the services and materials provided
by our job candidates. A small number of the service agreements we enter into with clients are projectoriented, which means we are compensated under the agreement only when our job candidates deliver
the project in accordance with the specifications in the agreement.

When we have a time and materials service agreement with a client, we typically bill the client for the
services performed by the job candidate and pay the salary and the applicable associated benefits, fees
and costs, such as social security, of the job candidate. The difference between what we bill our clients
and what we pay as salary, benefits and associated costs to the job candidates is referred to as the “billpay spread,” which is a key driver of our Group’s profitability. Our business units are organized around
a variety of staffing models which have varying degrees of specialization and scarcity, which impacts
the bill-pay spread. We focus on providing best-in-class service, matching excellence and investing in
digital initiatives to enhance our service offering as well as to automate processes and reduce costs to
maximize the bill-pay spread. Other elements that are part of our business model include a focus on
SME clients (who often lack in-house staff who can perform the staffing services that we provide),
providing training to our job candidates and including non-solicitation or minimum fees for a particular
period for job candidates in relation to the client for which they are staffed. For further information
about the pricing of our job candidates in our service agreements with clients, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key factors affecting our_
_results of operations.”_

The nature of the employment agreement into which we enter with job candidates and its duration
(whether it is an open-ended contract for the length of an assignment or an indefinite contract that is in
place whether or not the job candidate is on an assignment) will depend primarily upon the regulatory
environment in which our business units operate and the type of contract needed to attract, recruit and
retain job candidates. The nature of the employment agreement will also impact the termination and
notice periods. Indefinite contracts typically provide for three to six month notice periods for us to
terminate the employment agreement (except in Germany where terminations can happen sooner, and
labor durations are also typically shorter). The flexibility of open-ended contracts typically allows us to
enter into an employment agreement with the job candidate in connection with an assignment with a
client and the notice periods in the service agreement will be aligned with the notice period in the
employment agreement. On the other hand, as a result of the indefinite employment agreements, we
experience “bench time,” which is the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a
client assignment, for our job candidates with indefinite contracts. We carefully monitor the end date
of all such job candidates’ assignments and aim to line up the next assignment before their current one
comes to an end to minimize bench time. By minimizing a job candidate’s bench time, we aim to ensure
job candidates are being utilized on billable matters and generating revenue since we will be responsible
for the costs associated with employing them whether or not they are on assignment with a client.

In our engineering and consulting segment, employment agreements with job candidates are typically
indefinite due to the regulatory environment of the countries in which our business units in this staffing
segment operate or in order to attract and retain job candidates to fill staffing shortages. In certain
Powerhouses, such as Redmore, the employment agreement approach also facilitates longer and more
specialized training for job candidates and deepens the relationship between ourselves and these job
candidates. Within this segment, we also utilize a number of freelance job candidates (approximately
36% of job candidates at work as of September 30, 2022), primarily in the SOLCOM business, but also
in the Abylsen, Continu Professionals, GRITT and Redmore Powerhouses, whom we screen and match
with clients but who do not become our employees. In our specialized talent solutions segment, due to
the countries in which our business units in this segment offer services and our ability to attract and
recruit job candidates, we typically use fixed-term contracts with job candidates, except for our
operations in Germany, where we generally enter into an indefinite employment agreement with a job
candidate due to regulations on temporary staffing there. As a result, our specialized talent solutions
segment also faces bench time risk with respect to job candidates in Germany. The bench time risk in
the specialized talent solutions segment is, however, typically less than that in the engineering and


-----

consulting segment due to the shorter periods of services typically associated with these job candidates
and consequently the typically shorter notice periods required for our job candidates in this segment.

**The Recruiting Lifecycle: Facilitating Supply and Demand**

The recruiting lifecycle, which refers to the sourcing of job candidates, the identification of clients who
require our specialized HR solutions for particular jobs and then the subsequent matching, on-boarding
and payment or billing of such work, is a fundamental part of the operations of each of our business
units. Each of our business units is focused on the full spectrum of the recruiting lifecycle, which we
describe in more detail below. We also seek to align our in-house employees’ incentives, including sales
and recruiting teams, with the Group’s financial performance, with for example approximately 13% of
the Accent’s salaries being variable performance-based compensation as of December 31, 2021, which,
based on interviews with market participants, we believe is higher than the industry’s average variable
performance-based compensation.

**_Supply: Job Candidates_**

The following describes the typical elements of the recruiting lifecycle and the role we play in relation
to job candidates:

- **_Sourcing: Our business units define the job candidate requirements through their knowledge_**
of relevant end-markets, the needs of clients and, if applicable, any specific client requirements
provided, and then identify potential job candidates. We source job candidates through
databases, our presence at schools, universities and on job boards, our digital initiatives such as
SWOP, as well as through training for the skilling or reskilling of job candidates. We also make
use of foreign recruiting networks in certain of our Powerhouses, such as Accent, Covebo,
Redmore and TIMEPARTNER.

- **_Assessing:_** We assess job candidates by checking their education and skills (with additional
assessment for more specialized roles) and certify their capabilities.

- **_Matching: To match job candidates to clients’ opportunities, we check their fit with the job_**
position and company, including their mobility and availability for the location and duration of
the assignment. We then match a job candidate to a client and seek to ensure the job candidate
has a good understanding of the job and its requirements. All our digital initiatives aim to
improve data quality, which will lead to improved matching capabilities and results. For our
digital tools, such as SWOP and NOWJOBS, matching is all digitalized to the extent possible
to make the process more effective and efficient. We are also leveraging other different
matching engines to improve matching results based on specific criteria. In addition, we are
currently working to develop a candidate data platform (“CDP”) to further improve data quality
and management of job candidate information.

- **_Administrative management: We prepare the contract with the job candidate, whose terms may_**
vary based on the Powerhouse and the type of placement with which the job candidate is
matched, and we provide other administrative support throughout the assignment, including,
for example, the monitoring and management of vacation day requests and job candidate
payments, as well as the observation of sector agreements to ensure they are respected. We also
prepare the customer contracts and ensure all required information to commence the job is
shared with both the client and job candidate. We also follow up to ensure smooth contract
signatures are obtained initially and then upon renewal, if desired.

- **_On-boarding: We present the job candidate to the client, guiding him/her through interviews._**
We also follow up with job candidates in certain placements, such as within the engineering
and consulting segment, after candidates are placed in order to check their satisfaction with the
client and the assignment, whether the matching was accurate and to further understand any


-----

further wishes or objectives of the job candidate. Job candidates, especially in the engineering
and consulting segment, are also trained to fit certain job or project-specific tasks.

- **_Payroll and payments: We use digital timesheets and validate the timesheets, to facilitate the_**
correct payment of job candidates’ salaries. For our specialized talent solutions segment,
payments are generally made on a weekly or bi-weekly basis (but it is possible in some
instances on a daily basis), and client invoicing is done on a weekly basis.

**_Demand: the client and its HR staffing needs_**

The following describes the typical elements of the recruiting lifecycle and the role we play in relation
to the client’s HR staffing needs:

- **_Selling: We manage existing client accounts, identify potential clients and generate leads on_**
clients’ staffing needs.

- **_Publishing: We discuss general requirements with clients to gain an understanding of specific_**
job requirements and the required job candidates for such a job, and then publish offers via our
business units (including on their own websites), third-party applications or social media.

- **_Matching: We identify and present a short list of eligible job candidates for the position to the_**
client and organize meetings and interviews with the job candidates. Our digital initiatives, such
as Gighouse and NOWJOBS automatically match job candidates to clients, though we often
monitor our digital initiatives in order to facilitate the matching and engage with the job
candidates and clients when needed.

- **_Administrative management: We prepare the service agreement between ourselves and the_**
client.

- **_Invoicing and payments: We use timesheets and validate those timesheets to provide correct_**
and transparent invoicing to clients and correct salary payments to job candidates, with certain
of our staffing solutions utilizing digital timesheets. We can also manage the different legal
requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate for clients, including the payment of
payroll taxes and other withholdings.

- **_After-sales: We follow up with clients after on-boarding job candidates to check if the matching_**
was accurate and to assess the client’s satisfaction with the job candidate and the recruiting
process.

**_Our International Recruiting Network_**

As mentioned above, certain of our business units also utilize their international recruiting networks to
source job candidates. We believe that best practice for job candidate sourcing from international
markets is managed through foreign recruiting-dedicated teams in local foreign offices which are joined
up with foreign recruiting teams in host countries to identify clients with long-outstanding vacancies.
A foreign recruiting team with a presence in both countries can then offer a full-service proposition to
the customer covering all steps from sourcing and recruiting to on-boarding and payroll. We also believe
Covebo and Accent, and since 2019, TIMEPARTNER, reflect best practices by having job candidate
integration teams in the host countries that are dedicated to placing and monitoring foreign workers,
providing in-house training and offering other comprehensive services to assist with their integration
(support in finding housing, health, transport, tax assistance and possibly host country language
support). Covebo is also available as an app, allowing job candidates to access its services on mobile
devices. We also utilize some digital tools to recruit in foreign countries, such as Dora in Romania,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, the UK, Poland, Portugal, Bulgaria and Lithuania. Dora
is a chatbot, or a computer program designed to ask pre-set questions to screen job candidates before
engaging them with our live recruiters. Dora can be deployed through Facebook, Instagram and other


-----

social media platforms, targeting job candidates looking for job vacancies, and is available in Polish,
Romanian and English. The employment of foreign workers as our job candidates is conducted
according to the receiving country’s legal framework. See “Regulation” for information about the
regulatory environment in each of our primary geographic markets.

**Our Service Offering**

**_Two Staffing Segments_**

The Group has two segments which are also the Group’s financial reporting segments: engineering and
consulting and specialized talent solutions. The table below provides an overview of each staffing
segment, including key performance indicators, percentage of total Pro Forma Management Adjusted
Revenue, Pro Forma Management Adjusted EBITDA, and productive people at work, and geographic
split by revenue, in each case, as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.

____________________________

Note: Like-for-Like figures are based on the Company’s perimeter as of September 30, 2022; Like-for-Like figures are adjusted for one-off
and non-recurring items.

(1) Adjusted for September 30, 2022 perimeter, includes impact of acquisitions completed during the period as if they were completed
at the beginning of the period (including Bureau Brug, SOLCOM, TMI, Sira Consulting, Vijverberg, Atrium, BE-Consult, Bis
people, LD Personalvermittlung, StaffMe, FID and excluding Agium and ABMI).

(3) As of September 30, 2022.
(4) Unique clients year-to-date for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
(5) Breakdown calculated excluding intragroup and corporate costs.

Each of our segments is composed of multiple Powerhouses which use various brands to promote their
specialized HR solution offering. Through these Powerhouses, each segment typically focuses on
particular specialties to varying degrees, provides certain types of job candidates to meet clients’ needs,
and takes various approaches to employment terms and placement duration. A depiction of the typical
approach, employment terms and average placement duration of assignments at the Group’s staffing
segment is laid out below:

We believe our “cell division” expansion strategy, which focuses on securing new sales before
committing to additional costs, is a key driver of organic growth for our specialized talent solutions
segment. We hire additional sales personnel at an existing branch to focus on developing opportunities
out of our existing offices as commercial activity increases over time as we identify clear expansion
opportunities. A new, dedicated commercial manager is appointed and given an agreed period of time


-----

in order to acquire new clients or a new customer segment in a prospective area. Once these new clients
have been secured and adequate revenue has been generated, the commercial manager opens a new
office to handle such clients and becomes an office manager hiring their own staff. This strategy has
allowed us to continually strengthen our geographic breadth and depth without pursuing acquisitions
and with minimal risk, thereby driving our organic growth. We also believe that our variable
compensation model, which rewards recruiters, sales consultants and office managers at our branches
for finding, matching and retaining job candidates, also drives our organic growth, particularly for our
engineering and consulting segment.

**_Geographic Presence of our Staffing Segments_**

Our clients’ HR staffing needs are typically local, requiring HR staffing for such clients’ local business
location(s). For most of our Powerhouses, having branches close to our clients and job candidates is
important to being able to find and match job candidates. As a result, our Powerhouses typically have
a number of existing branches spread throughout the applicable geographic regions and focus on
building scale and density by opening new branches throughout these areas in order to be closer to job
candidates and clients.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France represented
approximately 23.4%, 50.2%, 15.1% and 11.3%, respectively, of our Pro Forma Management Adjusted
EBITDA.

Information about the number of branches that we operate in each of our two segment staffing levels,
as well as certain information about the branches operated by our principal Powerhouses, is provided
below.

**Engineering and Consulting**

Our engineering and consulting segment is comprised of our Abylsen, Continu Professionals, Redmore,
GRITT, SOLCOM and Cohedron Powerhouses, as well as IBB and AERO, which are Boutiques under
TIMEPARTNER. Abylsen, Redmore, SOLCOM and Cohedron are the largest financial contributors to
this segment. Powerhouses in this segment also generate revenue from France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium.

The figures below show the split of our engineering and consulting segment’s sales by brand and by
geographic market, respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.

________________________________

Note: Figures are calculated on the basis of the business unit accounts for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Sales by brand
are calculated on the basis of business unit accounts or subunits, in the case AERO and IBB. Sales by geographic market primarily
allocate revenue from the business units accounts to the primary geographic market of that business unit, though some adjustments


-----

for revenue generated in other geographies have been reflected when possible. As a result, the percentage of sales by geographic
market will not align with figures provided in our Financial Statements.

Our engineering and consulting segment is focused on recruiting highly skilled professionals to work
in fast-evolving and highly resilient sectors and regulatory environments such as energy,
pharmaceuticals, life sciences, construction, infrastructure, finance, legal, public affairs and technology,
among others, and also assists clients with the search and selection of the right candidate. The job
candidate placements by the Powerhouses in this segment are typically medium- to long-term. Unlike
the specialized talent solutions segment which typically generates the majority of its sales from SME
clients, the Powerhouses in our engineering and consulting segment are more mixed in the percentage
of clients that generate sales.

The job candidates in most of our engineering and consulting Powerhouses are indefinite employees on
our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. As a result, our engineering and
consulting segment in particular carefully monitors the end date of all job candidates’ assignments and
aims to line up the next assignment before their current ones come to an end. This monitoring seeks to
minimize “bench time,” which is the time during which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to
a client assignment. Our bench time for 2021 was approximately 0.3%.

As of September 30, 2022, our engineering and consulting segment served customers through a business
unit network of 110 branches, with approximately 1,705 in-house full-time equivalent employees and
12,283 job candidates at work. The following table shows these and other key performance indicators
for this segment for and as of the periods indicated:

**_Abylsen_**

Abylsen is an engineering and consulting Powerhouse headquartered in France, with operations in
France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and Luxembourg. Abylsen operates in a competitive but
fragmented market, where it is a relatively small company which challenges primarily large global
consulting or mid-sized global companies or brands, as well as regional companies or brands.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

We provide engineering and technology consulting services to clients, with the majority of sales revenue
from clients being from blue-chip or larger medium-sized companies. We also have a strong focus on
SME clients. In terms of end-market, Abylsen is a multi-specialist Powerhouse providing engineering
graduates to a wide range of end-markets. The largest end-markets served by Abylsen’s engineers are
energy, industry, telecommunications and pharmaceutical, though we also served a number of clients
in automotive, transport, aeronautics and defense and IT. Abylsen also serves these industries via its
Boutiques Pharmacos, Pharma Insights, Belgatech, Mykelson, Greenworking and ETA.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

Abylsen has a strong focus on balancing talent hiring and retention with wage control and turnover.
Furthermore, it uses engineers to recruit and match engineering job candidates to clients and to provide
in-house employees with end-market and job specialization and understanding.

The service agreements Abylsen enters into with clients will vary from client to client depending on
their end-market and staffing needs. For example, Abylsen also provided one of our clients, a leading
pharmaceuticals company, with a team to monitor the remediation of emergency lighting defects across
their expansive facilities.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

Since its acquisition in March 2015, Abylsen’s EBITDA has grown from €17.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015 to €20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA
growth of 2.4% per annum, and its revenue has grown from €75.7 million for the year ended December
31, 2015 to €124.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with a revenue growth of 8.6% per
annum. As of September 30, 2022, Abylsen had 45 branches, 480 in house full time equivalent
employees and 2,151 qualified specialists at work with different expertise (including mechanical,
electrical and chemical engineering). For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Abylsen had
_Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue of €206.2 million. The substantial majority of Abylsen’s_
revenue is generated in France, with the remainder of sales primarily being generated in Belgium. Bench
time was at 2.8% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.

**_Redmore_**

Redmore is a provider of specialized secondment and consulting services in our engineering and
consulting segment headquartered in the Netherlands, with operations in the Netherlands, Poland and a


-----

newly opened international branch in Spain (Triple A – Risk Finance) and Portugal (ITDS). We
typically provide consulting and secondment services to clients through job candidates with university
degrees or applied university degrees who are predominantly but not exclusively on indefinite term
contracts with us. Redmore and its Boutiques operate primarily in the banking and insurance sectors,
and also for governments and companies seeking financial staffing in enterprise recourse planning
(“ERP”) implementation, with competitors of a variety of sizes, including large global companies and
the “Big Four” accountancy firms.

Redmore has five complementary brands: Talent&Pro, Triple A - Risk Finance, Profource, ITDS and
Vialegis:

- **_Talent&Pro focuses on secondment of its own job candidates for the Dutch financial end-_**
market who are either on indefinite term contracts with us, temporary personnel or freelancers
(whom we have screened and assessed);

- **_Triple A - Risk Finance_** provides consulting services in the area of actuary and risk
management services and job candidates placed by Triple A - Risk Finance ordinarily have
actuarial and risk managements backgrounds;

- **_Profource provides secondment and consulting services through our job candidates who are_**
specialized in optimizing finance processes, the execution of enterprise resource planningrelated assignments and business processes outsourcing;

- **_ITDS provides specialist consulting for insurance companies, pension funds and banks; and_**

- **_Vialegis provides legal staffing solutions, including search and selection services, with a focus_**
on highly skilled white-collar job candidates primarily to the largest law firms in Belgium,
Luxembourg and Germany. Vialegis also offers, mainly in Belgium, interim legal counsels to
large corporates, for interim legal services and projects. Vialegis was one of our Powerhouses
in the engineering and consulting segment, but was sold to Redmore on September 30, 2021
and has since been operating as part of Redmore and is no longer a separate platform.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

While the majority of Redmore’s revenue comes from large corporates, SMEs and intermediate sized
enterprises also contribute a significant portion of its overall revenue. In terms end-market, Redmore is
a specialist Powerhouse providing financial consulting services to end-markets including insurance,
banking, government and health, as well as to other corporates.

Redmore, through its five Boutiques, is primarily engaged on time and material contracts. For the year
ended December 31, 2021, 92.5% by revenue of the contracts for the Boutiques under Redmore were
time and material contracts. Based on our periodic assessment of our contracts, we estimate that a
typical service agreement between these brands and a client will be a time and materials contract for an
average duration of six to ten months. Furthermore, our job candidates in Redmore are typically
employees on our payroll with an indefinite contract, meaning that bench time may occur. As a result,
this is a metric which is carefully monitored. Redmore also monitors the chargeability of its job
candidates since a number of its job candidates, primarily in its consulting services, will be engaged
periodically on non-chargeable activities such as training or pre-sale activities, which are expected to
benefit the Powerhouse’s sales in the long-run, but will result in periods where job candidates are not
generating revenue for the Powerhouse. Redmore’s revenue also stems from various other sources,
including fees relating to business process outsourcing for certain banks and insurance companies
performed via its service center in Utrecht, search and selection fees generated by Vialegis and Ctrl-F
for permanent placement at clients and fees relating to freelance placement.

_Types of clients and job candidates_


-----

Redmore has a strong focus on training, coaching and evaluating its job candidates and placing them in
assignments that develop their skills through experience. We typically recruit young professionals and
provide training to them from day one and over their years of employment with us as job candidates to
develop their financial expertise. The Powerhouse also offers an in-house academy with certifications
and qualifications, knowledge and competency frameworks to attract and retain job candidates and to
develop them with increasing market value for its clients. For many of the assignments for which our
Powerhouses’ job candidates are eligible, their market value (the bill value we can charge), increases
more quickly than the salary requirements (the payment we make to job candidates), which contributes
to the bill-pay spread and our Group’s profitability.

The service agreements that each of the brands under Redmore enters into with clients will vary from
client to client depending on a number of factors including their end-market and staffing needs.
Examples of service agreements entered into by each of Redmore’s brands are provided below:

- Talent&Pro provided a team of job candidates, comprising of a mix of junior and senior job
candidates, to one of our clients, a Dutch bank, to fulfil their need for compliance professionals
for a Customer Due Diligence Enhancement project involving approximately 30,000 KnowYour-Customer files related to SMEs. Talent&Pro designed and ran this project through an
outsourcing solution, including management, quality control and reporting. Talent&Pro placed
52 consultants through 2020 and 2021. This agreement generated a total revenue of €3.1
million, of which €2.8 million was generated in 2021.

- Profource was asked by one of its clients, a global e-commerce company, to implement and
rollout a new HR application, the Oracle HCM Cloud Time & Labor and Absence Management,
in 21 countries. Profource provided a team of eleven consultants and project managers to
successfully deliver this project, which generated a total revenue of approximately €0.4 million
in 2021.

- ITDS was asked by one of its clients, a term life insurance company, to assist with the selection
and implementation of a new core administrative system. In 2021, we placed four consultants
on this project, and this service agreement is expected to run until the end of 2023 and generate
a total revenue of approximately €2.0 million, of which we invoiced €0.2 million in 2021 and
€0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

- Triple A - Risk Finance was selected by several insurance companies to help implement IFRS
17. At four major Dutch insurance companies, Triple A - Risk Finance placed 31 job candidates
at each company in 2021. These projects together generated a total revenue of €4.6 million.

- Vialegis, at the request of one of its longstanding clients, an independent Belgian law firm,
searched and successfully recruited a team of lawyers consisting of three partners and seven
associates to join the client from another independent law firm. This placement generated a
one-off fee of €0.1 million.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

Since its acquisition in December 2017, Redmore’s EBITDA has grown from €20.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to €36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA
growth of 15.3% per annum, and its revenue has grown from €108.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to €138.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with a revenue growth of
6.6% per annum. As of September 30, 2022, Redmore had 20 offices, with 246 in-house full-time
equivalent employees and 2,040 job candidates at work. For the twelve months ended September 30,
2022, Redmore had revenues of €211.3 million. Nearly all of Redmore’s revenue is generated in the
Netherlands. Bench time was at 1.1% during the same period.

**_Continu Professionals_**

Continu Professionals is a specialist in finding white-collar secondment solutions for the engineering
and construction markets in our engineering and consulting segment. It is headquartered in the
Netherlands, with branches throughout the Netherlands, two branches in Belgium and a branch in
Germany that was opened at the beginning of 2019. Continu Professionals provides secondment
solutions to clients through job candidates who are planners, foremen, superintendents, technical
designers, project managers, architects and a wide variety of engineers such as in manufacturing,
infrastructure and construction (including specialization in social housing corporations) research and
development, and mechanical.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

The substantial majority of sales revenue from clients comes from SME and intermediate sized
enterprises. In terms of end-markets, Continu Professionals was a mono-specialist Powerhouse
providing secondment services towards the construction end-market, but has been diversifying its
services to include the industrial, civil and mechanical engineering end-markets. It has also increased
its specialization within the construction end-market through its acquisition of mténv, which is focused
on social housing corporations, as well as with the acquisitions of TechMatch in January 2020 and
Solyne in January 2021, both generally on technical profiles, with Solyne focusing primarily on public
infrastructure projects.

Continu Professionals is primarily engaged on time and material contracts, with a focus on assignments
that provide opportunities for temporary placements to lead to permanent positions, or “temp-to-perm.”
Continu Professionals’ exposure to bench time is limited due to its use of back-to-back contracts
(meaning a contract is entered into between us and the job candidate in connection with a secondment
or other staffing assignment with a client for the same duration) and short notice periods towards
seconded job candidates. Furthermore, since 2016, Continu Professionals has been a member of the
Algemene Bond Uitzendondernemeningen (the “ABU”), which means the applicable CLA is the ABU
CLA. This allows Continu Professionals to enter into multiple consecutive temporary contracts within
five years with an employee (as opposed to three under provisions applicable to it before joining the
ABU) and has also allowed Continu Professionals to offer longer duration contracts. See “Regulation”
for further information. For the year ended December 31, 2021, all of the contracts for the Boutiques
under Continu Professionals were time and material contracts, with a typical service agreement between
Continu Professionals and a client being for an average duration of twelve months. Continu
Professionals also engages in executive search assignments, including providing assessment services,
for some of its existing customer.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

Continu Professionals provides nationwide coverage through the Netherlands, offering a high degree of
specialization through its job candidates. The Powerhouse is recognized among the Group for its best
practices with respect to job candidate retention, providing regular touch points with job candidates
throughout their candidate journey, starting from first contact through to satisfaction surveys while on
assignment, as well as scheduled touch points to recognize and celebrate key events such as signing a
contract and the job candidate’s birthday.

The service agreements Continu Professionals enters into with clients will vary from client to client
depending on their end-market and their staffing needs. For instance, Continu Professionals placed 78
job candidates at the world’s leading lithography company which generated approximately €2.5 million
in revenue in 2021. Continu Professionals also placed 42 job candidates in engineering and construction
roles as well as a sales manager on premises at one of our clients, a European construction services
business, in 2021. This engagement brought in approximately €2.2 million in revenue in 2021.


-----

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

Since its acquisition in September 2015, Continu’s EBITDA has grown from €11.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to €11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA
growth of 1.3% per annum, and its revenue has grown from €68.7 million for the year ended December
31, 2015 to €97.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (which includes the combined revenue
contribution from the bolt-on acquisitions of MT&V in June 2018, Hartd in December 2018, and
TechMatch in January 2020 of €38.0 million), with a revenue growth of 6.0% per annum. Continu’s
revenue growth was affected in 2020 and 2021 due to management issues and adverse regulatory
conditions, as well as due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. As of September 30, 2022, Continu
Professionals had 19 branches, with 240 in-house full-time equivalents and 1,845 job candidates at
work. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Continu Professionals had revenues of €134.4
million. Nearly all of the Continu Professionals’ sales revenue is generated in the Netherlands. Due to
the open ended contracts and short notice periods possible with Continu Professionals’ job candidates,
bench time is not a primary key performance indicator for this Powerhouse.

_____________________________

Note: Figures are calculated on the basis of the business unit accounts for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Sales by brand

**_Accent_**

Accent is a specialized staffing Powerhouse focused exclusively on the Belgian specialty market, with
operations in Belgium and offices in Poland, Romania, Moldova and Portugal for the sourcing of job
candidates from its international recruiting network. Accent operates in a competitive and consolidated
market where it challenges larger global staffing solutions companies or brands, as well as regional
companies or brands.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

Accent focuses on the more sustainable and profitable “temp-to-perm” contracts, with a focus on
different niches and with a strong network of local branches, specialized to serving a specific type of
job candidate profile and client end-markets. Nearly all of the sales revenue from this Powerhouse
comes from SMEs or intermediate sized enterprises who value speed and flexibility, a close customerrelationship and who are willing to pay a premium for Accent’s services, therefore quality over quantity.
In terms of end-markets, Accent provides primarily blue-collar job candidates, of whom approximately
25% are foreign workers, to a wide range of end-markets. The largest end-markets served by Accent’s
job candidates are the construction, transportation, food service and hospitality end-markets, though our
job candidates also serve a number of clients in the services, healthcare and transport markets.

Accent is mostly engaged on time and material contracts, with a focus on “temp-to-perm” assignments.
Pursuant to temporary worker legislation in Belgium, Accent is typically able to align its job candidates’
contract durations with its clients’ contract duration, resulting in no exposure to bench time. See
“Regulation.” For the year ended December 31, 2021, nearly all of Accent’s contracts were time and
material contracts, with an average duration of 40 days. Since 2018, Accent has also begun to offer
search and selection services via its Ctrl-F Boutique, which are invoiced on a fee basis and are primarily


-----

supported by an internal “digital talent hunter” recruitment team. Accent’s revenues also include those
generated by NOWJOBS and Gighouse in Belgium.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

Accent has a strong focus on developing best services for a fast-yet-high-quality candidate and client
matching, driven by strong digital initiatives for which Accent is being recognized as a pioneer in the
market. Since assignments are typically for a relatively short duration, being able to quickly match a
job candidate and client quickly is important. Accent combines strong intimacy in the front with a strong
efficiency in the back.

Accent assisted one of our clients, a sanitaryware wholesaler with its on-going demand to find
temporary job candidates and then hire them as permanent employees by co-creating a website for
applicants and helped to coordinate the required education for future sanitary technicians. Accent also
assigned a dedicated single point of contact to a large infrastructure company to assist, through one of
its Boutiques, Engie, in the recruitment of the more technical profiles.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

As of September 30, 2022, Accent had 384 branches, which branches reflect teams dedicated to specific
specialty job candidates, 1,166 full-time equivalent employees and 28,987 job candidates at work. For
the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, Accent had Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue
of €618.8 million. Nearly all of the Powerhouse’s sales revenue is generated in Belgium.

**_Covebo_**

Covebo is a blue-collar specialized staffing Powerhouse. It is focused on the Dutch specialty blue-collar
staffing market, with operations in the Netherlands, as well as its branches in Hungary, Lithuania, Spain,
Poland and Romania, which are part of its international recruiting network.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

Covebo focuses on temporary staffing for two primary end-markets: (1) construction and technical,
including technical, construction and infrastructure jobs; and (2) production and logistics, including
food, logistics and industry jobs. Nearly all of the sales revenue from this Powerhouse comes from
SMEs or intermediate sized enterprises, with certain exceptions relating to larger clients in the
production and logistics end-market. Covebo provides blue-collar job candidates to its clients, of which
typically approximately 80% are foreign workers. The most frequent end-markets served by Covebo’s
job candidates are the food production, retail, logistics, engineering and construction and infrastructure
end-markets.

Through its digital initiative Fygi, Covebo offers interim recruitment, search and selection and
recruitment marketing services. Independent freelancers will become recruiters for mostly white-collar
profiles at different companies, by using Covebo’s digital tools and platforms. Covebo takes a
commission on the revenue generated by these freelancers. Revenue of this initiative for the year ended
December 31, 2021 was €5.4 million.

Nearly all of Covebo’s contracts are typically flexible contracts, meaning that Covebo is not obligated
to pay any temporary job candidate not engaged in billable work for up to the first 52 weeks (depending
on the employment agreement entered into with such job candidate), with discretionary temporary
employment agreements permitted to be entered into (with up to a maximum of six employment
agreements) over the next three years (depending on the employment agreement entered into with such
job candidate) thereafter. Covebo’s exposure to bench time is thus limited due to the regulatory
framework and their ability to use of flexible contracts with job candidates. Some job candidates placed
by Covebo are freelancers, especially in the VNOM offices of Covebo. For the year ended December
31, 2021, the substantial majority of Covebo’s service agreements with clients were time and material


-----

contracts, with an average of 5.8 job candidates per client, with an average duration of approximately
41 weeks.

Covebo New Energy was launched at Covebo. Covebo New Energy is specialized in mediating
technicians in the sustainable industry, such as solar panel technicians, insulation technicians, electric
charging station technicians, air and heat pump technicians, windmill technicians and technicians who
specialize in other new energy sources.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

Covebo was one of the first dedicated blue-collar foreign recruiting based staffing companies in the
Netherlands. It offers a full-service foreign recruiting process for job candidates and clients by
facilitating and organizing housing, transportation and insurance (including health insurance) and
offering social guidance and support. In 2018, Covebo launched an in-house education program, the
Covebo Craftsman School, to support its full-service proposition which offers foreign job candidates
education on Dutch tools, materials and ways of working. The program trains and tests candidates on
various skills such as masonry, plumbing, electrics and painting. It also facilitates quick onboarding
since job candidates have been assessed as part of the training program and familiarized with customerspecific standards.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

Since its acquisition in June 2015, and including the contributions of Accent NL, Covebo’s EBITDA
has grown from €5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to €17.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA growth of 21.4% per annum, and its revenue has grown from
€117.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to €311.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2021, with a revenue growth of 17.7% per annum. As of September 30, 2022, Covebo had 8,095
beds for job candidates, 1,365 cars for people at work and 7,788 health insurance policies for its foreign
temporary job candidates. As of September 30, 2022, Covebo had 40 branches, 831 full-time equivalent
employees, 12 international recruiting offices and over 12,156 job candidates at work. For the twelve
months ended September 30, 2022, Covebo had revenue of €540.7 million. Nearly all of the
Powerhouse’s sales revenue is generated in the Netherlands.

**_TIMEPARTNER_**

TIMEPARTNER specializes in the staffing of high-demand blue-collar profiles in Germany and offers
tailor-made and integrated flexible HR-solutions in the field of temporary staffing, personnel placement,
provision of temporary workers and on-site management. In June 2021, we acquired avanti, which
complements TIMEPARTNER’s service portfolio by adding a presence in the medical and healthcare
segment. Following the acquisition of LP Personalvermittlung, avanti will operate under our new
Powerhouse, House of Care Talents Germany. In addition, Zaquensis, previously a Powerhouse in our
legacy general staffing segment, is now part of the TIMEPARTNER operation following the partial
merger between TIMEPARTNER and Zaquensis in the second quarter of 2021. TIMEPARTNER also
has operations in the Czech Republic.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

TIMEPARTNER typically provides low- to medium-skilled job candidates who are from general
backgrounds to clients from a diversified group of end-markets, with the greatest concentration of
clients typically being from the industry, logistics, construction, aviation, food and automotive endmarkets. The job candidate placements by TIMEPARTNER (except IBB and AERO) are typically
short- to medium-term (with a maximum duration of 18 months), unless agreed otherwise by company
unions (approximately 48 months). In general, the contract framework for temp employees are
indefinite duration, making it a core task for TIMEPARTNER to perfectly match the job assignments
with the contract duration. That means it is crucial to make sure the (very short) notice period of client
agreements corresponds to the assignment duration and matches the notice periods of the employees,


-----

or otherwise to staff temp employees on new assignments. TIMEPARTNER also provide specialized
services through avanti in relation to the provision of medical and care personnel to hospitals, special
clinics, rehabilitation clinics and nursing homes.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

TIMEPARTNER’s clients particularly value the ability to place job candidates quickly (particularly for
short-term staffing needs), quality candidate pools, assistance and peace of mind regarding our ability
to help them comply with and navigate complicated regulatory and compliance landscapes, and good
value for money. Additionally, customers are using our competence as a master vendor to manage all
their temporary workforce, or, to a less extent, as a recruiting partner.

TIMEPARTNER’s job candidates are often looking for an HR staffing company that can find them a
job quickly, treat them well, provide opportunities for clients to take them on as permanent employees
and have a good pool of local job opportunities. TIMEPARTNER facilitates these interests from clients
and job candidates by having good industry knowledge in the markets that we serve, making decisions
quickly, having a quality pool of candidates available (and working with our international recruiting
network, where needed, to ensure we can help staff shortages) and job candidates for management
positions with good experience and skills.

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

Since its acquisition in 2016 (based on the combined performance of Zaquensis and TIMEPARTNER
following their merger in 2021 and including the contributions from the bolt-on acquisitions of Mach
in 2017 and Weiderer in 2018), TIMEPARTNER’s EBITDA has grown from €28.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to €33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an EBITDA
growth of 3.1% per annum, while its revenue has decreased from €425.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to €420.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the impact of the
AüG regulatory reform and the dynamics in the aerospace segment. As of September 30, 2022,
TIMEPARTNER had 190 branches, 555 full-time equivalent employees and 10,264 job candidates at
work. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, TIMEPARTNER had Pro Forma Management
Adjusted Revenue of €356.6 million. Nearly all of the Powerhouse’s sales revenue is generated in
Germany.

**TMI**

On March 3, 2022, we acquired TMI, our new Powerhouse in our specialized talent solutions segment.
TMI specializes in providing staffing service for the healthcare sector in the Netherlands, assisting with
the recruitment of candidates for healthcare providers such as hospitals, public care institutions,
ambulance staff and nursing homes. TMI also supplies temporary staff, intermediates for freelancers,
and offers flexible jobs. Their job candidates usually include doctors, nursing staff, psychologists, and
pharmacists.

_End-markets served and contract framework_

TMI provides services primarily to clients in the healthcare sector, such as hospitals, public care
institutions, ambulance staff and nursing homes. Services rendered include providing temporary staff
(flex, 0-hours and secondment) in times of peaks or sickness, as well as general recruitment. Placements
in this segment are typically short- to medium-term, unless agreed otherwise by the client. Most clients
have a framework contract with TMI for a period of one to three years with yearly indexation or
collective employment raise.

_Types of clients and job candidates_

TMI provides services to a broad array of healthcare clients, who particularly value the high quality
candidates, broad pool of professionals and the “one stop shopping” service model offered by TMI.


-----

TMI is well recognized as the leading healthcare staffing company in the Netherlands that helps clients
to ensure continuity of healthcare services despite an ever-increasing shortage of qualified personnel in
the industry.

TMI’s job candidates are often looking for a staffing company that provides a broad selection of clients
and placement opportunities without the restrain of irregular rosters, and offers good financial benefits
and the opportunity for further education (such as through the TMI Academy).

_Financial performance and other operating metrics_

As of September 30, 2022, TMI had 16 branches, 123 full-time equivalent employees and 3,114 job
candidates at work. We estimate TMI contributed €56.0 million to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. See “Summary consolidated other financial and Pro
_Forma information—Pro Forma Adjusted Historical Information of the Company.”_

**Digital Initiatives**

We develop digital initiatives with a dual purpose: (i) to support growth initiatives for our operations
by enabling us to reach additional job candidates or serve new end-markets in a fully digital manner,
and (ii) to introduce cost efficiencies to our processes to remain competitive against technological
developments. By producing tools for our business units to meet business needs where no applicable
tool exists, we aim to disrupt the existing staffing market and to expand our market share by developing
new solutions or end-markets. Our digital initiatives are typically not directly revenue-generating, with
the exception of SWOP Recruiter, NOWJOBS and Gighouse, but instead indirectly contribute to
revenue generation by assisting us with identifying additional job candidates or matching them with
clients. Such initiatives can also help us reduce our expenses by automating or introducing other time
efficiencies into certain time-intensive aspects of the recruiting lifecycle. Once a digital initiative has
been developed and tested, it is typically launched by one of our Powerhouses. Any revenue generated
by the digital initiative, whether directly or indirectly, would be accounted for as part of the revenue of
the staffing unit to which the Powerhouse belongs.

During 2021, we centralized all our digital assets in House of Invest, creating one platform to meet
current needs and invest in new needs as they arise. This enabled us to further invest in our digital
roadmap and internationalize our digital initiatives. The main purpose of House of Invest is to roll out
the digital initiatives across all House of HR Powerhouses and Boutiques and to capitalize on a
centralized knowledge base. House of Invest now owns NOWJOBS, Gighouse, SWOP and SWOP
Recruiter, Continu-Connect, CV creator and My Talents (Softskillz), holds minority ownerships in Dora
and Ariad (a traditional digital marketing staffing company) and a majority ownership in Book’u. For
the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from digital solutions amounted to 2.6% of total revenue,
compared to 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

We strive to keep our digital development team lean and operationally independent, which we believe
promotes an entrepreneurial, start-up-like culture within the team. Re-usability of our developments is
key, so applications can be exchanged across different geographies and our operating companies. We
have in the past and expect in the future to use acquisitions as another means to acquire additional digital
technologies that will complement our digital initiatives strategy or instill a more rapid growth of our
sales through the digital platforms, particularly NOWJOBS. Currently, we are developing a CDP to
consolidate all candidate data and leverage this data to gain better access to job candidates and improve
our matching capabilities. We also invest in AI tools to improve matching accuracy. Our philosophy
for job applications is “mobile-first,” meaning we are developing our digital platforms in a way that
clients and job candidates can match easily on mobile phones.

**_Mobile technology_**


-----

Our Group is strategically committed to mobile-based recruiting solutions to reach a larger pool of
potential candidates and increase user engagement. We have several live projects, including the
following mobile apps:

- **_SWOP and SWOP Recruiter: Inspired by Tinder, SWOP provides a mobile platform for job_**
candidates to “swipe right” to indicate interest on job opportunities they wish to pursue. SWOP
was downloaded 17,596 times in 2019, 46,540 times in 2020 and 14,753 times in 2021. SWOP
has enabled the placement of 60.75 job candidates per month on average as of September 30,
2022. The app was updated in early 2020 in order to include not only Accent or Ctrl-F
vacancies, but also include vacancies that are aggregated from other company websites, thus
allowing it to show approximately 60,000 vacancies (of which approximately 23,000 come
from Accent) in the Belgian market and 72,000 vacancies in the Dutch market as of October
2022. Candidates swiping on non-Accent vacancies are also contacted in order to help provide
them with the necessary support if they do wish so. In May 2021, we launched SWOP Recruiter,
which consists of a free digital platform that helps Belgian SMEs with the day-to-day
management of their vacancies. The application is currently linked to our SWOP application,
and includes a job board multi-poster tool that allows SMEs to post vacancies simultaneously
on multiple platforms.

- **_NOWJOBS: NOWJOBS is a mobile platform aimed at reaching student job candidates and for_**
flexible jobs (such as short-term part-time jobs), historically a difficult market to serve due to
low margins. By implementing a mobile, app-based platform, NOWJOBS has matched over
3,100 active companies with more than 30,800 job candidates in 2021 on a low cost basis for
our Accent Powerhouse. NOWJOBS was launched in the Netherlands in late 2019 and in
France in 2021. We also recently launched NOWJOBS in Germany in June 2022. Since
NOWJOBS mostly services the entertainment, hospitality and retail segment, it was heavily
impacted during the lockdown period during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in the second
quarter of 2020; however, it still managed to reach a revenue in 2020 that was only 8.4% below
its 2019 revenue. It has complemented its offering now also towards food retail and food
production companies, as well as home delivery models, such as Take-Away.com and Hello
Fresh. We acquired StaffMe in July 2022, a French digital platform focusing on student
employment and which is primarily active in the retail, health event and hospitality sectors,
supplementing our NOWJOBS offering. Through this acquisition, we also acquired the other
companies of the StaffMe group, including the StaffMe Academy, the first training organization
for young entrepreneurs, and the Accelerator, a program of integration through selfemployment for those who are far from employment. NOWJOBS will operate under the
StaffMe brand in France given the high level of StaffMe’s brand awareness in that country.

- **_Gighouse: Gighouse is a mobile app designed to reach freelance or independent job candidates_**
and match them with clients. We add value by screening the freelancers or independent job
candidates to check their qualifications and experience to provide a narrower pool of suitable
options for clients. We also monitor the customer assignments to ensure freelance job
candidates are assigned to legitimate projects.

- **_FYGI:_** FYGI is a mobile platform that connects freelance recruiters to Covebo’s staffing
network and job candidate pool on a commission basis. FYGI focuses on providing freelance
recruiters access to a larger pool of potential job candidates than they would independently be
able to access in order to fill permanent positions.

Additionally, we have a full team dedicated to creating a Group framework and data platform for each
Powerhouse to develop tailored mobile solutions for its end-markets.

We have also developed CV Creator, a service that allows job seekers to create professional résumés
quickly and easily. CV Creator is available as a free web service. We developed together with the Ghent
University the MySkillz tools, through which job candidates can perform tests and get insights about


-----

themselves. One of such tests is ‘Who am I,’ which allows job candidates to better understand how they
function in their professional lives. Another test is ‘Who do I want to work for,’ which helps to indicate
the types of companies that fit best for a particular candidate. We are also developing a client version
of the ‘Who do I want to work for’ test, which indicates the type of job candidates that fit best with a
particular team leader, and the ‘My brains’ test which attempts to indicate the intelligence level of a job
candidate within their education level.

**_Chatbot technology_**

Through our investment in Happy Recruiter, we developed Dora, a recruitment robot, to leverage
chatbot technologies to perform recruitment services. Recruiters get a fully customizable chatbot
colleague that screens and communicates with job candidates located anywhere around the clock. Dora
speaks seven languages and can work side-by-side with live recruitment team as the first line of
interactions with job candidates. Dora is capable of reengaging existing job candidates on any marketing
channel, including website, database, social media channel, job board and applicant tracking system.
Dora held approximately 63,000 interviews in 2021. This technology helps find passive and active job
candidates and creates efficiency in the reaching and screening process.

**_Matching technology_**

Matching candidates to open positions is a critical component to our business and we are developing
solutions to optimize the matching processes using data analysis and AI. Such matching technology
projects focus on improving the quality of the data, including by encouraging individuals to update their
information directly on our platforms and mobile applications. Additionally, we are developing and
experimenting with AI-enabled speech-to-text tools, including for the MyAccent app, an app that is
connected with Google Assistant (for instance via smartphone or Google Home) to engage in a job
search. By converting the job candidate’s speech into text on such platforms, we will be able to develop
and test methods to automatically detect job candidates’ skills, interests and personality traits and to
better prepare our job candidates for interviews for consultant positions, so we can then more efficiently
and effectively match job candidates to appropriate job opportunities. These initiatives aim to increase
the quality and efficiency of matching and to identify skill set needs in order to develop appropriate
training. Together with the Ghent University, we developed soft skills testing to allow candidates to
discover their personal preferences as to the type of companies they wish to work for or as to their own
personality.

**M&A Process and Criteria**

M&A has been a key strategic pillar to strengthen our Group, reinforce our market positions, enter new
market segments and countries, achieve above-market growth and profitability and reinforce the
offerings of our Powerhouses. Since 2015, we have added the Abylsen, Covebo, Continu Professionals,
TIMEPARTNER (including Zaquensis), Redmore (including Vialegis), GRITT (formerly the TEC
Alliance Group), Cohedron, SOLCOM and TMI Powerhouses to the Group, as well as acquired
minority stakes in multiple companies. Beginning in 2018, we have also been focusing on bolt-on
acquisitions to enhance the platforms of our existing Powerhouses, including most recently signing the
purchase agreements for the bolt-on acquisitions in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Bolt-on
acquisitions allow our Powerhouses to either expand geographically or gain expertise in a certain endmarket or job profiles. While the growth of our Addressable Market slowed down during the Covid-19
pandemic, the economies in our primary markets have fully recovered in 2021, and according to SIA,
our Addressable Market is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 5% from 2021 to 2023.
We believe that we are poised to continue growing at or above the industry average growth rate in the
future. See “—Our History” and “—Our Strategies—Continue to target accretive acquisition
_opportunities to achieve European leadership.” for further information about our history and our current_
M&A strategy, respectively.

We have built and follow a structured process to assess M&A opportunities, from deal sourcing to
support for newly acquired companies, which are supported by our in-house capabilities. We also


-----

believe our approach to M&A has created an attractive value proposition for company owners at target
companies who wish to continue to develop their businesses while being supported by a larger group
and contributed to our success in closing M&A opportunities that we identify.

Our typical selection criteria, M&A assessment and integration process, value proposition and our
current M&A activity, are described further below.

**_Selection criteria_**

We use an initial set of criteria to identify targets. These criteria examine the historic growth, geographic
location, staffing segments, growth and margin prospects, end-market specialization and cultural fit to
investigate M&A opportunities. Targets that are determined not to fit the selection criteria are
eliminated from consideration.

Our criteria include:

- **_Geographic location: We look for targets in countries that have a stable economy with low_**
employment, high salary level, high temporary staff penetration, a stable regulatory
environment and supply and demand mismatch for skilled labor. Our current key areas of focus
include countries where we are already present, particularly Germany, the Netherlands,
Belgium, France and Switzerland, as well as new geographic or other development areas,
including Austria, the Nordic countries and targets in other countries where the target offers
digital technology that complements our strategy.

- **_Staffing segment: We look for targets in both our engineering and consulting and specialized_**
talent solutions segments. By targeting the same staffing segments as our Powerhouses, we can
reinforce their expertise areas or geographic coverage through bolt-on acquisitions. We can also
look at new areas of expertise or areas in which we want to grow more extensively, such as the
healthcare, life science, IT sectors and the digital, financial and strategic consulting profiles.

- **_Growth and margin prospects: We seek targets where we see above-market growth and margin_**
prospects. To that end, we look for targets (1) offering specialist services, focusing on attractive
specialties, which we believe drive higher price points for services (see “—End-market
_Specialization” below), (2) having competitive positioning with a high relative market share_
and demonstrated track record and experience and (3) displaying operational excellence with
well-structured commercial processes, lean cost structures and entrepreneurial ability.

- **_End-market specialization: We look for targets that are staffing end-markets with significant_**
levels of job shortages. Currently, the core end-markets we believe face such shortages include
engineering, financial services, IT, pharmaceuticals, life sciences and healthcare. Furthermore,
our current operations in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands provide HR solutions that
meet most of the top critical job shortages in those markets. We have identified nursing,
healthcare life science, IT sectors and the digital, financial and strategic consulting profiles as
areas where we still have expansion possibilities. These are specializations that we may develop
to fill our specialization gaps and meet the critical job shortages in those geographic markets
but also acquisitions may be one way to move into these end-market specializations. Expanding
each Powerhouse across our core geographies is also part of our acquisition strategy. We also
consider opportunistic acquisitions of targets that do not serve these end-markets, but which
show high growth and margin prospects.

- **_Cultural fit: We look for targets that have like-minded management teams. Since our Group_**
operates in a people business, finding targets that are a good cultural fit is critical. We also
generally invite the active members of the management teams to stay on board after an
acquisition.


-----

- **_Valuation: Historically, we have acquired bolt-on acquisitions in the range of 5x to 8x, and_**
platform acquisitions in the range of 8x to 9x LTM EBITDA.

**_M&A assessment and integration process_**

Our structured process helps us identify opportunities, investigate and assess the targets that meet our
selection criteria and support the target company once it has been acquired. Three levels of our
organization are involved in deal sourcing: our central Group (especially our M&A Department, which
includes M&A analysts and an M&A legal counsel), our Powerhouses, and our shareholders. Each level
evaluates opportunities through the rubric of our selection criteria. Opportunities identified which meet
the selection criteria are considered on a weekly basis via the M&A team and are then evaluated by our
investment committee and an opportunities file is maintained. Our investment committee includes
representatives from each of the three constituencies (our central Group, our operating companies, and
certain of our shareholders). To further assess an opportunity that meets our selection criteria and
undertake due diligence, we typically try to have a brief meeting with management or advisors before
we sign a non-binding indicative offer letter and then undertake due diligence on the target, including
meeting with its founders and management team, and prepare a short file that summarizes our
assessment of the target company, its market and its key financial and other metrics. The investment
committee will evaluate the opportunities and, if recommended, they are presented to our Board for a
go/no go decision. Opportunities may be approved or rejected, or the Board may recommend that more
time needs to be taken for further assessment. If approved, we will submit a binding offer and determine
which entity in the Group will acquire the target and discuss the target operating model. Typically for
deals that are closely related to one of our Powerhouses, the acquisition will be undertaken by that
Powerhouse, with deals less closely related or very large being acquired at the central Group level. The
assessment process from initial sourcing to closing takes an average of six to nine months to complete.

Once a deal closes, our central support team assists acquired companies. The central team provides
performance support by sharing best practices, financial guidelines and reporting templates and assists
with regulatory compliance issues. The time required to integrate the target into our Group varies
depending on the size of the target, but typically takes six to nine months from closing. Financial
integration is prioritized and is typically completed within 90 days of closing.

**_Our value proposition for target company owners_**

We believe our approach to M&A has created an attractive value proposition for company owners at
target companies which have contributed to our M&A track record. We believe four aspects of our
M&A approach contribute to our appeal to targets and our track record at closing transactions where
we have submitted a binding offer:

- **_Financial incentives: As part of our M&A approach, we generally either offer our management_**
team and individual platform or bolt-on managers a local minority investment (typically for
smaller acquisitions that may need to continue on a standalone basis), and/or we will offer
ordinary shares, often combined with access to the Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”), which
is linked to the performance of their respective companies. This equity type of ownership allows
us to continue to align the incentives of those at the Powerhouse level with both the performance
of our Group and their individual Powerhouse. Typically for smaller acquisitions, we may
continue to acquire only a stake in the target company, but immediately include a mechanism
to roll over shares at group level, exchanging local shares for ordinary and MIP.

- **_Operational freedom:_** For platform acquisitions that are broadening our base of services
offered, we typically offer target companies the option of retaining their full autonomy at the
level of their entities’ operations. We also typically preserve the brand identity of the acquired
companies, which are not consumed into the House of HR brand or the brand of any
Powerhouse. Bolt-on acquisitions may retain less operational autonomy, depending on the


-----

nature of the acquisition and how it is integrated into our Group, but we also typically preserve
their identity and branding.

- **_Support on critical issues:_** Companies joining the Group benefit from support on complex
regulatory and compliance topics from our central teams, and IT security and financing and
financial reporting immediately begin to integrate. These companies are also provided with
access to our foreign staffing recruiting network and experience, our digital platforms (though
they may require adaptation and implementation for their local markets) and the possibility of
accessing our credit lines at a Group level.

- **_Our reputation: We are a leading company for specialized HR solutions with a strong Organic_**
Growth track record and a reputation for operational excellence and quality. We also have a
track record of successful acquisitions.

**_Current M&A activity_**

The following current M&A activity has recently been taken or is being undertaken by the Group, as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum:

- We recently completed the acquisitions of:

(a) Agium on October 7, 2022, which is a bolt-on acquisition of a Dutch company
specialized in deploying skilled professionals to support companies in their day-to-day
finance and control processes and implementation of structure changes and is expected
to operate under our Redmore Powerhouse;

(b) Job Raccoon on November 14, 2022, in an asset deal to supplement our
TIMEPARTNER Powerhouse; and

- In addition, on October 25, 2022, we signed the Put Option Agreement to acquire the French
company ABMI, a consulting and engineering services group operating mainly in three
engineering segments: (i) product design and industrialization, (ii) industrial processes and (iii)
industrial facilities (e.g., nuclear and railway infrastructures). The put option may be exercised
by the sellers upon completion of the information and consultation of the relevant employee
representative bodies to which the offer has been submitted and we are awaiting for written
confirmation of approval. The acquisition is expected to be completed in December 2022,
subject to the put option being exercised by the sellers, regulatory approvals and customary
closing conditions. Following the acquisition of ABMI, we expect to combine ABMI with
Abylsen in order to create a new Powerhouse, ABY Engineering.

We also have a number of other potential targets in our pipeline for 2022: we have submitted one nonbinding offer, we are currently reviewing the investment memorandum for one target and we have made
non-committal contact for several other targets. We have also lost out on nine potential acquisition
opportunities in 2022. These targets were identified and selected in line with our selection criteria and
our M&A strategy.

**Properties**

We have properties located strategically across the markets in which we operate. As of September 30,
2022, we had 1,110 property leases, which includes our headquarters, our business units’ branch office
networks in the host countries we serve, our international recruiting network’s recruiting offices where
we source foreign job candidates, as well as our leases for housing that we provide to certain in-house
employees or job candidates. The location and breadth of our business units’ branch networks vary by
business unit and geographic location, but generally support our candidate recruiting and client-facing
services.


-----

Our Group’s headquarters are currently located in Roeselare, Belgium (the “Headquarters”). The
property at our Headquarters has three components: (1) the land on which the office buildings are
located; (2) the land on which the parking lot is located; and (3) the office buildings built on the land.
We have a 50% ownership interest over both the land for the office buildings and the land for the
parking lots. The other owner of such land is Pro-Serve Software en Advies BVBA (“Pro-Serve”). With
respect to the office buildings built on our land, the builder of our office building, Fortis Lease NV
(“Fortis”), owns the building right to the building and we lease it from Fortis, along with other lessees.
At the end of the building right period on April 1, 2030, ownership of the building will pass to ourselves
and Pro-Serve without any additional expense. This building will be used solely by Accent beginning
from January 1, 2023 for its central support services. Our Group’s headquarters are expected to move
to the Netherlands in connection with the timing of the Acquisition, while the supporting services units
are expected to move to Kortrijk, Belgium, by the third quarter of 2023, with the lease agreement
already finalized.

**Employees**

The breakdown of our annual average of full-time equivalent employees (which includes job candidates
at work) on a segmental basis and at the Group level as of the periods indicated was as follows:

**December 31,** **September 30,**

**2019** **2020** **2021** **2021** **2022**
Engineering and Consulting ........................................ 7,468 6,902 10,875 10,210 13,989
Specialty Talented Solutions....................................... 41,408 39,946 50,243 53,392 62,970
Central ........................................................................... 18 30 62 61 71
**48,895** **46,878** **61,180** **63,663** **77,030**
**Group Total .................................................................**

_Employee compensation_

Up to 50% of the total compensation of our business unit managers, branch managers, sales consultants,
and recruitment consultants is variable and linked to performance:

- **_Business unit management: The performance targets for business unit managers are generally_**
tied to business unit level KPIs, such as business unit EBITDA, EBITDA growth, new clients,
people at work and productivity. Additionally, managers at the business unit level are often
entitled to participate in equity compensation schemes at the Group level, which links their
compensation to our performance as a whole.

- **_Branch managers: The performance targets for branch managers are generally tied to branch_**
level KPIs, such as new clients, people at work and productivity. Branch managers are
compensated with bonus cash incentives, and successful achievement of KPI targets often
impacts promotion decisions. Some of the most successful, long-serving branch managers may
also gain access to the MIP.

- **_Sales consultants: The performance targets for sales consultants are generally tied to individual_**
sales KPIs, such as the number of daily sales, customer calls, customer visits, customer offers,
prospects offers, new customers, and total active customers. Sales consultants are compensated
with bonus cash incentives, and successful achievement of KPI targets often impacts promotion
decisions. Additionally, top performing sales consultants may have the opportunity to open new
branches.

- **_Recruitment consultants: The performance targets for recruitment consultants are generally_**
tied to individual recruiting KPIs, such as the number of candidate calls, candidate interviews,
and successful placements. Recruitment consultants are compensated with bonus cash
incentives, and successful achievement of KPI targets often impacts promotion decisions.


-----

Additionally, the top performing recruitment consultants may have the opportunity to open new
branches.

Additionally, managers at the Group level receive substantial performance-based compensation.

We believe that our emphasis on performance-based compensation contributes to an entrepreneurial
culture throughout the Group and aligns the incentives of our business unit-level employees with that
of the central Group.

**Intellectual Property and Brands**

We use a variety of trade names, trademarks (including for word, figurative and combined marks) and
domain names in our business. Due to the Group’s acquisition history and organizational approach, the
Group’s intellectual property portfolio is mainly held, maintained and monitored by our business units
or their subsidiary undertakings at the local level. The Group’s intellectual property portfolio includes
trademarks and domain names primarily registered in Benelux and the EU, as well as other registrations
to cover certain other local jurisdictions where one of our business units or its subsidiary undertakings
operate. We do not market our services under a House of HR brand but, instead our Powerhouses have
their own brands which are used to market their specialized services. As a result, the most important
trademarks and domain registrations to our business are those associated with the brand names of our
Powerhouses:

- **_Abylsen, which uses the Abylsen, Pharmacos, Greenworking, Belgatech, Mykelson, ETA and_**
PI brands;

- **_Accent, which uses the Accent Jobs, Accent Construct, Gighouse, NOWJOBS, Jobroad, Sixie_**
and Ctrl-F brands;

- **_Cohedron,_** which uses the Cohedron, Plangroep, Plangroep Financiële Services, Wyzer,
Argonaut, Zorg-Lokaal, Future Communication, Vanberkel Professionals, Vijverberg
Interimjuristen, Sira Consulting, Sqiq and Human Capital Group brands;

- **_Continu Professionals, which uses the Continu Professionals and Solyne brands;_**

- **_Covebo, which uses the Covebo, VNOM, Eurojob, FYGI, PRAN, Effect and FID brands;_**

- **_GRITT, which uses the Tec and Logi-technic brands;_**

- **_Redmore, which uses the Talent&Pro, Triple A – Risk Finance, Profource, ITDS, Vialegis, and_**
Agium brands;

- **_SOLCOM, which uses the SOLCOM brand;_**

- **_TIMEPARTNER,_** which uses the TIMEPARTNER, IBB, AERO HighProfessionals, LD
Personalvermittlung and avanti brands; and

- **_TMI, which uses the TMI brand._**

In addition, following the ABMI acquisition we will also use the ABMI trademark and brand.

During 2021, we centralized all our digital assets and the corresponding intellectual property rights in
House of Invest, which now owns NOWJOBS, Gighouse, SWOP and SWOP Recruiter, ContinuConnect, CV creator and My Talents (Softskillz), and holds minority ownerships in Dora and Ariad (a
traditional digital marketing staffing company) and a majority ownership in Book’u. See “—Digital
_Initiatives.”_


-----

In addition, certain of our Powerhouses use proprietary software applications which have been
developed or acquired by us. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as
well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and our
proprietary technology within such applications. While none of these applications is currently material
to our business, we expect that they will become more important to our operations as our digital
initiatives grow and become more embedded into our HR solutions.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal Matters and the Regulatory Environment—Our business
_may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our_
_business depends or if we are subject to claims of intellectual property infringement.”_

**Marketing, Communication and Digital**

Our marketing teams operate on both the Group and local business unit level. Our Group’s marketing
efforts are led by our Group’s chief marketing officer and chief digital officer. Each of our Powerhouses
typically has its own chief executive officer and/or marketing manager lead its local marketing
initiatives. The role of our Group chief marketing officer is to facilitate the two-way exchange of
information and best practices and to oversee press and public relations on a Group level and the
development of thought leadership strategies. Our Group chief digital officer is responsible for guiding
and training our local business units and for integrating the Group’s experience in digital recruiting
strategies into the practices of our business units.

Our marketing team’s primary focus is to efficiently attract new job candidates and clients for our
business units. Each of our local business units also focuses on building brand awareness of its particular
service offering. We apply a four-channel approach to marketing:

- **_Our Own Websites: Our Powerhouses’ and Boutiques’ own websites are a key aspect of our_**
marketing strategy. We use them to attract active jobseekers. Our Group marketing team
provides trainings on search engine optimization to enhance our ability to use the websites for
marketing and sourcing job candidates and clients.

- **_Commercial Job Boards:_** We also make use of commercial job boards, but are gradually
shifting away from them and rely increasingly on the digital initiatives that we have been
investing in, such as search engine and social media marketing, which includes connecting our
jobsites to Google’s application programming interface.

- **_Social Media: We believe that social media is an important channel to reach out and source_**
passive jobseekers. Social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok
are core advertising platforms in our recruiting and targeted advertising strategy, especially
given the structural shortage of skilled workers in the current market. Every Boutique has its
own social media presence to cater to the job candidates and communities in the respective
sectors that they focus on.

- **_Digital Innovation:_** Our strategy is to constantly look out for new innovation ideas and
technologies that we can leverage to improve our recruitment efficiency. This strategy has led
to the development of many successful tools, apps and digital platforms, such as SWOP,
NOWJOBS, Gighouse, Book’u and many others. We believe that these tools provide us with a
competitive edge and help to keep our recruiting strategy future-proof. See “—Digital
_Initiatives” for further information._

We seek to maximize our total return on marketing spend by frequently analyzing and adjusting our
budget and chosen advertising channels to those that are most effective.

**Information Technology and Innovation**

Our Group’s IT capital expenditure budget for the year ended December 31, 2022 is approximately
€21.0 million. Our IT expenditure has increased in recent years in connection with our digital initiatives
strategy and the growing size of our operations, though we believe that our level of IT expenditure is
still below the industry average for the professional services sector due to our lower expenses for the
development of technology as a result of our targeted combination of in-house resources and off-theshelf IT solutions. Furthermore, we have created a centralized and specialized development team, House
of Invest, to develop reusable different applications for our Powerhouses. House of Invest is able to
integrate and reuse certain concepts that were developed in the past when designing and developing
new applications, which helps to lower our internal development cost.

Among our Powerhouses, Accent has the largest concentration of our IT assets and employees, in large
part due to Accent’s historical role as the original member of our Group and its development team for
the MyTools application, a proprietary ERP platform that executes a wide range of functionalities
supporting Accent’s business operations. Additionally, Accent’s IT staff also supports services that
Accent provides to other Powerhouses and Boutiques. With respect to our other Powerhouses, Covebo
also employs an internal IT team, with the remaining Powerhouses largely relying on the Group’s IT
services or external IT service providers for their IT needs. These and other third parties that we use
typically work alongside our Powerhouses or other Group entities under service level agreements, with
appropriate relationship management.

Our IT infrastructure is built around a clear cloud strategy based on a strong security layer.

Our Group’s IT platform is organized around three pillars: data security and privacy; integration; and
innovation. A description of each of these pillars is provided below:

- **_Data security and privacy_** encompasses all processes and initiatives aimed at ensuring the
security of our Group’s IT infrastructure, the prevention of the loss of sensitive or private data
and relevant regulatory compliance.

- **_Integration and infrastructure_** encompasses all efficiency and cost-related initiatives,
including identifying Group-wide best practices and common infrastructure, software platforms
and processes and security. All companies within the Group are part of our Central Active
Directory, and all servers and infrastructure are hosted on Microsoft Azure, a cloud computing
service.

- **_Innovation encompasses the development of new technology and markets for the Group. All_**
our development efforts and IP rights are centralized under House of Invest.

**_Data Security and Privacy_**

We operate in countries with numerous data security and privacy laws. Our IT systems and processes
are critical to our business operations and strategy, and it is therefore imperative that we maintain
policies and procedures to comply with such laws, such as GDPR. Our Group’s IT professionals
implement systems (AI-based security monitoring and dual-back solutions) and practices to protect
against the loss of sensitive or confidential information, for example through running penetration and
vulnerability testing on a periodic basis. Additionally, our Group’s IT professionals run awareness
campaigns aimed at embedding protection and security of information into our operational business
culture.

**_Integration_**

Our Group has undertaken several integration initiatives aimed at driving synergies across Powerhouses
and their constituent entities and creating efficiencies from economies of scale. We also maintain a set
of IT guidelines that relies on a mandatory/recommended/allowed (“MRA”) framework, which enables


-----

operational flexibility for our Powerhouses while maintaining commonality across the Group where
critical. Under the MRA process, our IT managers discuss and identify a list of mandatory,
recommended and allowed applications, processes and technologies on a Group-wide basis. Mandatory
items include, for instance, a common email platform, Office 365, a disaster recovery plan and securityrelated software, such as password vault and spam, multi-factor authentication and phishing protection.
This MRA process aims to lower operational costs, improve price negotiation positions, enhance
specialized IT knowledge and support available across our Group and facilitate synergies across
Powerhouses. It also assists our Powerhouses with staying attuned to modern applications and software
advancements.

Under the revised Group guidelines, local servers are no longer allowed and must be transitioned as
soon as possible to our central cloud server on Microsoft Azure. Powerhouses are required to use at a
minimum a Tier 3 data center (which is a data center that provides redundancy, dual-powered servers,
network links and other IT components) until such transition is complete. We are aiming to complete
the consolidation of our data centers on the cloud for the entire Group. Migration to the cloud by our
Belgium data centers has been completed and full migration of production servers towards Azure was
completed in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, an updated data and cyber security program has been
rolled out throughout the Group. As part of our data strategy, a project to create a CDP to enhance
candidate user experience in Belgium was launched in 2022.

**_Innovation_**

We continue to improve and innovate our IT platforms, both within Powerhouses and across the Group.
We have one central unit for the Group which centralizes our digital expertise and competence. This
central unit focuses on how to digitize and deploy artificial intelligence (“AI”) in our core business and
experiments with new technologies. See“—Digital Initiatives” for further information.

**Insurance**

The principal risks that we insure against are directors’ and officers’ liability, cyber, general third-party
liability, general professional liability, workers’ compensation (for Belgian entities only), motor thirdparty liability, travel and property damage, with all Powerhouses (except Cohedron and TMI) also
holding credit insurance to protect their accounts receivables.

We have consolidated our insurance programs on a Group-wide basis. General third-party liability,
general professional liability, cyber, directors’ and officers’ liability and travel insurance programs are
fully consolidated at the group level. Property damage and credit insurance are group programs open
for our Powerhouses, meaning the Powerhouse can make use of our conditions and coverage under
these programs subject to local requirements and needs. Apart from the Group insurance programs, a
series of standalone policies have been put in place at the Powerhouses’ level, mostly covering
operational risks, such as local motor liability, local workers’ compensation and other specific risks.
We believe these insurance consolidation initiatives optimize our insurance coverage. We maintain
insurance in such amounts and with such coverage and deductibles as we believe are adequate to cover
the major risks of our business. We cannot, however, assure you that all losses and liabilities that we
may incur would be recoverable. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and
_Industry—Our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all the risks we face and, if we are no_
_longer covered by our existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on_
_acceptable terms or at all.”_

**Internal Audit and Risk Management**

We have developed an enterprise risk management and internal audit framework that is able to assess
and mitigate risks and offer value-added auditing by optimizing systems, processes and efficiencies.
This has been formalized in a governance and control charter, which was signed by all Powerhouses.
We have established a Group audit committee, whose role is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight
responsibilities for financial reporting, internal controls, auditing and legal and regulatory compliance.


-----

We also utilize an external and independent auditor, Ernst & Young, to execute a yearly audit plan that
reviews the effectiveness of our internal controls and risk management policies and procedures.
Additionally, we have implemented conflicts of interest management as well as major incident policies
and procedures at the Group level. The Group also rolled out an internal code of conduct and a violence
and harassment policy (coupled by a relevant e-learning program and an anonymous reporting tool) in
2021. The Group also expects to roll out a non-discrimination policy and a whistleblower policy during
the course of 2022.

**Environmental, Social and Governance**

The sustainable profitable growth of our Company depends on the economic, environmental and social
sustainability of the communities we live and work in. Accordingly, we have developed sustainability
initiatives and embedded them into both our strategy and day-to-day activities across our Powerhouses.
We monitor the impact of our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives through
targeted qualitative and quantitative KPIs, which yielded the following results in 2021:

- _Staff turnover: 27.0% of in-house employees left the Group_

- _Sickness: 4.8% of absences due to sickness, accidents at work or unjustified absences_

- _Female ratio: 59.0% of employees, 45.5% of managers and 30.0% of the board of directors,_
respectively, were female

- _Training:_ 91.1% of in-house employees received training, which amounted to 128,953 of
training hours

- _Sustainability rating:_ 63.2% of sales covered by EcoVadis’ sustainability rating, which
measures the quality of a company’s sustainability management system through its policies,
actions and results

- _Digitalization: 2.6% of sales generated from digital solutions_

Our established and robust governance framework covers areas such as employee well-being,
education, equality, climate and economic growth, and it does not only aim to involve our in-house
employees, clients and job candidates, but also our shareholders and other stakeholders. Our ESG
strategy framework has already been formalized in a charter, which we believe will guide us to achieve
our targeted KPIs and comply with relevant ESG regulations. We are planning to start sharing
consolidated reporting on the ESG KPIs from our Powerhouses on a quarterly basis with our ESG
committee in 2022 to demonstrate our accountability. We seek to meet the applicable industry
certification standards and aim to have all 10 of our Powerhouses become EcoVadis certified by the
end of 2022. Our Powerhouses currently also implement at business unit level a broad range of ESG
training initiatives, including hiring dedicated personnel to oversee the implementation of strategies and
the launch of learning platforms.

We partnered with an external third party to monitor and analyze our carbon dioxide emissions. In terms
of carbon footprint assessment, we evaluated a total of 35.6 thousand tCO2 in 2021 (including 14.2
thousand, 3.6 thousand and 17.8 thousand of scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions, respectively), an increase
from a total of 27.2 thousand tCO2 evaluated in 2020 (including 11.3 thousand, 8.3 thousand and 7.6
thousand of scopes 1,2 and 3 emissions, respectively). Energy intensity (presented in GWh/€m
revenues) changed from 3.2 in 2019 to 2.4 in 2020 and further to 2.8 in 2021 (i.e., a decrease of 13%
from 2019 to 2021), and carbon intensity for scopes 1 and 2 emissions (presented in tCO2/€m revenues)
changed from 9.3 in 2019 to 12.3 in 2020 and further to 7.8 in 2021 (i.e., a decrease of 16% from 2019
to 2021). We will continue to expand, refine and improve our strategy to fulfil our commitment to
reduce carbon footprint and energy use. For example, we are switching to hybrid and electric vehicles
for company cars and aims to continue to increase the use of sustainable cars in the future. In 2021, we


-----

had a total fleet of 5,817 vehicles, of which 4.0% (1.8% in 2020) and 1.7% (0.8% in 2020) were hybrid
cars and electric cars, respectively. We also encourage the use of bikes and public transportation.

In addition to the existing individual diversity and inclusion policies of our Powerhouses, we are
working to implement a framework at the Group level in 2022 to raise awareness of diversity and
inclusion, which is anticipated to comprise targeted policy, training and reporting mechanisms to help
eliminate workplace discrimination. Furthermore, we impose on our top management the responsibility
to report on incidents of fraud, corruption and other serious misconduct and irregularities, and we are
working on implementing other Group policies and initiatives to supplement our governance
framework, including a conflict of interest policy, business ethics, customer satisfaction survey and
customer grievance follow-up.

For details on our various committees, including our ESG committee, see “Management.”

**Legal Proceedings**

At any given time, we may be a party to legal proceedings or be subject to non-litigated claims arising
out of the normal operations of our business, such as labor law-related claims. We are currently involved
in one material legal proceeding.

The founder and former Chief Executive Officer of one of our Powerhouses in France, who we
dismissed for cause, brought two claims against us for €15.0 million alleging that he is entitled for
additional monetary payment for certain shares that he owned in the French Powerhouse of which he
was CEO and for certain shares he owned in House of HR. We believe that he is not entitled to such
additional payment as a result of him having been dismissed for cause. An arbitration panel has heard
the case and a decision is expected during the course of the first quarter of 2023. Should he prevail in
his claim, an outcome that we consider unlikely, we could be liable to pay the full amount of his claim,
although we estimate that our actual exposure would be substantially lower than this amount. We have
not currently set aside provisions in respect of this litigation.

Other than as described in this Offering Memorandum, we are not involved in any legal proceedings
which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations. We note, however, that the outcome of legal
proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this regard. See “Risk
_Factors—Legal, regulatory or other adversarial action, including employment-related claims, could_
_have a material adverse effect on our business.”_

**REGULATION**

**Overview**

The European staffing solutions industry is regulated. The applicable laws and regulations vary for each
country. Staffing solutions providers are generally subject to one or more of the following types of
government regulation:

- regulation of the relationship between a staffing solutions provider and its job candidates;

- regulation of the relationship between a staffing solutions provider and its clients;

- registration, licensing, record keeping and reporting requirements;

- substantive limitations on the provider’s operations;

- health and safety regulations; and

- data protection regulations.

In most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including Belgium, the Netherlands, France and
Germany, staffing solutions providers are considered the legal employers of their temporary employees.
In other jurisdictions, staffing solutions providers are not considered the direct legal employers of
temporary employees, but they still have the legal responsibility to collect taxes and social security
deductions and transmit such amounts to taxation authorities. Below we describe certain features of the
relevant laws and regulations that apply in each of the countries in which we have significant operations.

In addition to applicable national laws and regulations, Directive 2008/104/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of November 19, 2008 on temporary agency work (the “Temporary
Agency Work Directive”) also regulates temporary agency work at the level of the European Union.
The aim of the Temporary Agency Work Directive is notably to lay down a principle of nondiscrimination and equal treatment for job candidates in relation to the employees of the client as a
general rule. It also sets clear limits to prohibitions and restrictions that may be imposed on the use of
temporary agency work, while also setting common minimum standards for temporary agency work in
the EU. The Temporary Agency Work Directive stipulates that basic working and employment
conditions of job candidates shall be, for the duration of their assignment at a client, at least those that
would apply if they had been recruited directly by the client to hold the same position. The Temporary
Agency Work Directive allows member states to make exceptions to this principle of nondiscrimination in the cases of job candidates assigned on the basis of a permanent agreement and who
continue to be paid in the time between assignments, and collective agreements and assignments
derogating from the principle while respecting the overall protection of temporary agency workers. The
Temporary Agency Work Directive has been transposed in national laws of the EU Member States.

**Belgium**

In Belgium, secondment of staff is prohibited, except in specific cases provided by law. Secondment of
staff is defined as when an employer “lends out” its employees to a third party for the services of these
employees, and that the third party exercises part of the employer’s authority over such employees. The
compliance obligations regarding welfare at work, however, remain with the employer and not the third
party. The third party generally does not assume the full authority of the employer over the employees
on secondment, and any authority the third party has over the employees will have to be expressly
specified in a written agreement executed between the employer and the third party, and any such
contractual authority will have to be exercised according to the provisions in the written agreement and
generally does not erode the employer’s authority over its employee in any way. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the client can give instructions relating to health and safety issues to the employees
concerned.


-----

Exceptions to this general prohibition include: temporary staffing (also called “temporary agency
work”) and other specific situations such as permitted posting for a limited time, posting within the
framework of an employment pathway recognized by the region, posting as part of an employer
grouping and specific posting in the public sector.

In the case of temporary staffing, a job candidate (the employee, also called “interim worker”) is hired
by a staffing services provider (the employer) with the intention of being put at the disposal of a client
of such staffing services provider. The staffing solutions provider remains the sole legal employer, while
transferring the exercise of the actual employer’s authority to the client during the temporary assignment
(i.e., the client will give instructions to the job candidate with regard to the work to be carried out).
Conditions to the recruiting of job candidates for the purpose of putting them at the disposal of a client
are strictly defined and the working conditions of such job candidates are required by law to be similar
to the working conditions of the permanent employees of the client executing the same job. Temporary
staffing is mainly regulated by the Act of July 24, 1987 on Temporary Work, Interim Work and
Secondment of Employees to Users (as amended) (the “Act on Temporary Work”), which implements
the Temporary Agency Work Directive. Specific rules on temporary staffing apply in some sectors,
such as the construction sector.

**_Primary Regulatory Framework_**

The most common situations in which temporary staffing is authorized: (i) as a replacement for a
permanent worker; (ii) during temporary increase of work; (iii) execution of unusual work; (iv) ensuring
artistic performance; and (v) in order to employ the job candidate as a permanent worker (insertion
_professionnelle/instroom)._

In the following cases, recourse to temporary work is also prohibited or limited:

- It is forbidden to resort to temporary employment for the replacement of an employee when the
suspension of the performance of the employment contract of the permanent employee is due
to a lack of work for economic reasons or in case of bad weather conditions

- It is possible that restrictions on recourse to agency work are foreseen under collective or
sectoral or company agreements

- Temporary employment is still not allowed in certain public sectors

- It is forbidden to resort to temporary work when a strike or lockout is in progress in an
enterprise, and a temporary employment agency is prohibited from sending temporary workers
to or keeping them at work in an enterprise that is in such a situation

- When the user has not obtained permission from the union

_Permits or other authorizations_

In order to engage in temporary staffing, a staffing services provider is required to obtain and maintain
mandatory permits from each relevant regional authority within Belgium, which may have different
eligibility requirements and conditions. A staffing services provider must obtain a permit from each
region in which it wants to operate, even if its registered office is located in a different region in
Belgium. Each region also has specific rules to allow, under certain conditions, a staffing services
provider which already has a certification in one of the three regions of Belgium and wants to extend
its activity nationally, to automatically get the same permit in the other regions. Permits for temporary
staffing are given for an indefinite period or a definite period.

_Contractual framework_

The employment of a temporary employee at a client requires the conclusion of:


-----

- a commercial agreement between the staffing services provider and the client that must be put
in place in writing within seven days from the commencement day of the temporary employee’s
employment;

- an employment agreement between the staffing services provider and the temporary employee
that must be in writing and must, at a minimum, contain certain mandatory term; and

- the intent to enter into an employment contract for temporary work between the staffing
services provider and the temporary employee.

The maximum duration of the temporary staffing and the applicable procedure to follow both vary
according to the applicable scenario.

_Employment terms and compensation_

The compensation of a job candidate may not be less than the compensation to which such job candidate
would have been entitled had such job candidate been a regular permanent employee of the client.
During the period of temporary agency work, the job candidate has the same rights as permanent
employees with respect to access to the infrastructure and services of the client, unless different
treatment is objectively reasonable. Furthermore, the rules on working time that apply to the client also
apply to the job candidate, unless a specific exception is provided.

_Termination_

In general, if an employment agreement between the staffing services provider and the temporary
employee is terminated by either party, the non-terminating party is entitled to a termination
compensation unless such termination is made in the case of force majeure. In the case the staffing
services provider is the terminating party, no termination compensation is due if the termination is
attributable to the client, and provided that the staffing solutions provider redeploys the dismissed job
candidate to another client for the remaining period of the terminated agreement under identical working
conditions and with an identical salary. No termination compensation is due to the temporary employee
should he refuses such redeployment. Certain specific termination requirements need to be complied
with in case the temporary employee is employed to replace a permanent employee.

_Liability for damages_

Under Belgian law, only the client may be liable to a third party for damage suffered by such third party
caused by a fault of the temporary employee in the course of performing his activities for the client.

_Fines, penalties and other enforcements_

Civil, administrative and/or criminal penalties may be imposed in case of a breach of the prohibition of
secondment, including breach of the abovementioned conditions to conduct temporary staffing
activities:

- potential nullity of the employment agreement between the employee and employer (or the
staffing solutions provider);

- the client and the job candidate are deemed to have entered into an employment agreement for
an indefinite duration. However, the job candidate concerned may terminate this indefinite
contract at any time, without notice and without paying the client or the actual employer any
compensation. The job candidate may exercise this termination right up to the date on which
their service to the client is scheduled to end;

- the staffing solutions provider and the job candidate are deemed to have entered into an
employment agreement for an indefinite duration. However, the job candidate concerned may


-----

terminate this indefinite contract, without notice or any compensation, within seven days of
commencing employment;

- the staffing solutions provider and the client are jointly liable for the payment of the social
security contributions, salary and benefits arising from the new employment agreement;

- the client is liable for any damage caused by the job candidate (based on article 1384 of the
Belgian Civil Code);

- administrative or criminal fines may be imposed on the staffing solutions provider and on the
client, as well as an operating ban. Fines are multiplied by the number of job candidates
involved (maximum up to 100).

_Health and safety obligations_

The client is responsible for the implementation of all rules on health and safety at the workplace and
the welfare of a job candidate during the period in which he works for the client, as the client exercises
authority over the job candidate is therefore deemed the actual employer during this period and. As a
result, the client is required to comply with the welfare legislation for the job candidate, such as
preparing workstation records, ensuring proper on-boarding process, making suitable personal
protective equipment available and conducting investigation into any material accidents at work.

The client must also otherwise guarantee the same level of protection of a job candidate in terms of
health of safety, as guaranteed to its regular permanent employees.

Before a job candidate starts working for a client, the client must provide the staffing solutions provider
with all necessary information on the required professional qualifications and conditions for the job, as
well as on the specific features of the work position.

The staffing solutions provider, for its part, takes care of the occupational accident insurance and prior
health surveillance of the temporary worker if the client’s job sheet requires it. The staffing solutions
provider is thus responsible for prior health surveillance and also for mandatory vaccinations and has a
role in maternity protection.

Other health and safety obligations generally lie with the client, but in the case of authorized secondment
of staff, such obligations remain with the staffing solutions provider (who are effectively employers) in
accordance with the instructions relating to health and safety issues set out in services agreements.

**_Other Regulatory Frameworks_**

Whereas most of our business is conducted in the regulatory framework outlined above, we are subject
to certain additional regulation based on the specific nature of the services we provide in each
jurisdiction. Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and regulations that apply to these
services.

_Temporary outsourcing of employees_

Certain of our Powerhouses also conduct consulting and secondment staffing (“temporary
outsourcing”) activities in Belgium. As with temporary staffing, temporary outsourcing is not
considered as prohibited secondment when a number of strict legal rules are met. An agreement must
be signed between a contractor (which would be the staffing solutions provider) and a client to provide
a certain service, perform a certain task or work on a specific project, rather than the provision of staff
(which could be considered a prohibited secondment), including a detailed list of the instructions which
the client may give to the temporary staff. Clients may indeed give instructions to the temporary staff,
provided that instructions, subject to certain exceptions, (a) are defined in a written agreement between
the consulting agency (in our case, the staffing solutions provider) and the client, the instructions do not


-----

erode the staffing company’s authority over its staff, and are communicated to the client’s works
council; or (b) relate to the client’s health and safety obligations.

_Temporary outsourcing of self-employed workers_

Belgian law also allows for outsourcing self-employed workers or freelancers only when no party
exercises an employer’s authority over the worker. If the parties (incorrectly) qualify their relationship
as an independent relationship rather than an employment relationship, this can result in specific
liabilities for the party that is considered to be the employer in the event of a re-characterization of the
self-employed relationship into an employment relationship. Such a determination is made based on all
factual circumstances including the following four main criteria: the will of the parties as expressed in
the agreement, the level of freedom to organize working time, the level of freedom to organize work,
and the level of hierarchical control. For specific sectors (such as construction, transport, cleaning,
security and surveillance and agriculture), certain legal presumptions apply. Re-qualification criteria
for Belgium are set out in a Program Act of December 27, 2006 and as well as in case law.

_Search and selection services_

The staffing solutions provider may also use its pool of job candidates to provide recruitment services
and also arrange for initial placements. Regional authorities may have different eligibility requirements
and conditions to conduct search and selections services.

The description below sets out the current statutory framework governing temporary staffing in the
Netherlands.

**_Primary Regulatory Framework_**

Dutch law defines a “temporary agency agreement” as a special type of employment agreement under
article 7:690 of the Dutch Civil Code (“DCC”) whereby the employee is made available by the staffing
solutions provider (the employer) to a third party (the client) in the context of the employer’s business
activities, to perform work under the management and supervision of the third party. In effect, the law
states that the relationship between a staffing services provider and a temporary agency worker qualifies
as an employment agreement. In principle, there is no requirement for an agreement between the client
and the temporary employee. Under the current definition, as interpreted by the Dutch Supreme Court,
both the traditional forms of temporary agency work as well as payrolling qualify as temporary agency
work. However, for payrolling, there is a separate legal and contractual framework, as set out below
under “Payrolling”.

_Permits or other authorizations_

The SNA quality mark (SNA-keurmerk) is an accreditation for staffing solutions providers. This quality
mark is provided by the foundation Stichting Normering en Arbeid on the basis of two NEN standards:
NEN 4400-1 for Dutch companies and NEN 4400-2 for foreign companies. Although not mandatory
for staffing solutions providers to obtain the SNA quality mark, it is important in practice.

_Contractual framework_

In case of a general temporary agency agreement, the staffing solutions provider has more flexibility in
framing the contractual relationship with the job candidate, including the possibility of applying more
fixed term contracts and of terminating the contract if the client retracts the assignment. On the other
hand, in case of a secondment or consultancy agreement, the staffing solutions providers generally have
an indefinite term contract with the job candidate, and such contract cannot be terminated even if the
client retracts the assignment.


-----

In addition to Dutch employment law, the largest temporary staffing organization in industry (the
“ABU”) and the largest Dutch trade unions have agreed on a collective labor agreement for the
temporary employment agency industry (the “ABU CLA”). The current ABU CLA for 2021 to 2023
was declared contractually binding for the sector as of August 25, 2022, which applies to all staffing
solutions providers that fall within its scope—irrespective of whether a staffing solutions provider is a
member of the ABU.

In effect, the ABU CLA provides that, over three phases, as temporary agency workers are employed
for longer periods of time, the temporary agency worker gradually becomes entitled to more job security
and secondary benefits, such as a pension and training.

There is also another collective labor agreement for staffing solutions providers known as the NBBU
CLA. The NBBU CLA is not declared generally binding and only applies to staffing solutions providers
who are a member of NBBU, another employers’ organization for the industry. Staffing solutions
providers who are a member of NBBU, are explicitly excluded from the scope of the ABU CLA.
Although they are formally still two different CLAs, the current ABU CLA and NBBU CLA contain
substantively the same employment terms and conditions.

In general, the DCC imposes restrictions on (i) the number of successive fixed term employment
agreements that the employer (in this case, staffing solutions provider) can enter into with an employee
and (ii) the total duration of such fixed term employment agreements. If an employer enters into more
than three successive fixed term employment agreements, or if the total duration of the successive fixed
term employment agreements is more than three years, the last fixed employment agreement is
converted into an indefinite term employment agreement by operation of law. This rule is referred to as
the statutory “chain rule” (ketenregeling).

When an employment agreement qualifies as a temporary agency agreement, this has significant
implications for the statutory possibilities to maintain a ‘flexible’ employment relationship. By way of
a collective labor agreement, it is possible to deviate even further from the chain rule as follows:

(i) The maximum number of successive fixed term employment agreements is six and the
maximum total duration of such fixed term employment agreements is three years. In addition,
the ABU CLA provides that the exemption from the chain rule for temporary agency
agreements is extended from 26 weeks to 52 weeks of employment. During the exemption
period, it is possible to enter into an indefinite number of fixed term employment agreements,
and the number and duration of the fixed term employment agreements during this period do
not count toward the maximum total number and duration.

(ii) In practice, the above means that a temporary agency agreement can be a “flexible”
employment relationship for a total of four years, with the first disapplying the chain rule and
with a temporary employment clause (as described below) and the next three years with up to
six fixed term employment agreements.

(iii) Further, it is possible to agree on a written provision whereby the employment agreement
between the employee and the staffing solutions provider terminates by operation of law if the
posting of the employee at the client ends at the request of the client. This provision is referred
to as the “temporary employment clause” (uitzendbeding). The ABU CLA provides that such
provision is valid during the first 52 weeks instead of 26 weeks of employment.

_Employment terms and compensation_

An employee that is made available to a client is in principle entitled to receive the same basic
employment terms and conditions as the employees of the client working in the same or equivalent
positions (article 8 of the Placement of Personnel by Intermediaries Act). The basic employment terms
and conditions include salary and other compensation, working hours and vacation entitlement. The
ABU CLA validly limits the number of compensatory elements that need to be applied. Variable


-----

compensation, for example, is excluded. Limited exceptions apply for a so-called “allocation group”
(i.e., persons appointed by the government as having a “distance to the labor market” and persons
without a basic qualification who will follow qualifying training via the staffing solutions provider).
These employees receive wages determined by the staffing solutions provider in accordance with the
ABU CLA.

Furthermore, after one year of employment on the basis of a so-called ‘on-call’ agreement (in short,
without a fixed number of working hours), temporary agency workers (and other on-call employees)
should be offered a fixed number of working hours that is the average of their working hours over the
last twelve months. In addition, in case of an ‘on-call’ agreement, employers are required to pay full
compensation if an assignment is altered within four days prior to commencement.

_Termination_

A staffing solutions provider may terminate an employment agreement in principle (i) if the posting of
the employee with the client ends within the term of the temporary employment clause, if contractually
provided for, (ii) against the end of the employment agreement, subject to an advance notice of one
month or (iii) with permission from the cantonal court.

In general, if an employer wishes to terminate a fixed term employment agreement before the end of its
term or an indefinite term employment agreement, it must show that it has a lawful ground for
termination and that the employee cannot be redeployed in another suitable position within the group
within a reasonable period of time.

Employees, including temporary workers, are entitled to a transitional payment upon termination of
employment at the employer’s initiative (which includes the non-renewal of a fixed term employment
agreement at the employer’s initiative).

_Liability for damages_

Typically, liability towards a client for damage suffered by that client as a result of fault of its temporary
agency workers is borne by the client. Occasionally, however, a staffing solutions provider may be
liable for such damage.

_Fines, penalties or other enforcements_

The law provides specific penalties for non-compliance with the labor law, and the Dutch Labor
Inspectorate enforces fines and penalties in relation to any violations of the labor law. Under the Foreign
Nationals Employment Act, an employer is obligated to ensure its employees are allowed to work in
the Netherlands. If a foreign employee works in the country without a valid permit, the employer risks
a fine. A fine can also be imposed if there is no valid registration in the trade register of the staffing
services provider in accordance with the Work Allocation by Intermediaries Act. An employer is also
obligated to adhere to the work hours requirements set out in the Working Hours Act, and any violation
of this law may result in a fine. In addition, the Dutch Labor Inspectorate also enforces the application
of the “wage correlation norm”. This norm prescribes that minimum standards and wage components
should be applied to temporary agency workers on par with regular employees in comparable positions.

_Health and safety obligations_

The staffing solutions provider is obliged to assure that it receives, and makes available, a hazard
identification and risk assessment (risico-inventarisatie en—evaluatie) from the client. Furthermore,
the staffing solutions provider is obliged to inform the temporary agency worker of the risks at the
workplace. In the event of non-compliance with these obligations, the staffing solutions provider may
be liable towards its temporary agency workers for damages as a result of inadequate working
conditions at the workplace. The temporary agency workers can also bring a claim for damages against


-----

the relevant client, so the temporary agency workers may, at their discretion, make a claim against the
staffing solutions provider, the client or both.

**_Other Regulatory Frameworks_**

Whereas most of our business is conducted in the regulatory framework outlined above, we are subject
to certain additional regulation based on the specific nature of the services we provide in each
jurisdiction. Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and regulations that apply to these
services.

_Payrolling_

In the case of payrolling, the agency takes on the administrative and financial obligations for, but is not
involved in the recruitment of, consultants. Furthermore, the consultants are (in principle) exclusively
provided to one client. Although payrolling is formally considered a form of temporary agency work,
there is a legal distinction between “regular” temporary agency agreements and payrolling agreements.
Under the new legislation that entered into force on January 1, 2020, the rules regarding payrolling have
been significantly amended. The ABU CLA does not apply to payrolling agreements anymore as of 1
January 2020 (with the exception of limited transitional arrangements).

Payroll employees are entitled to all terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions
(including certain pension entitlements as from January 1, 2021).

The same rules relating to fixed term employment agreements and termination of employment
agreements apply for payroll employees as for regular employees of the client. A temporary
employment clause and the additional flexibility to enter into fixed term employment agreements as set
out above are no longer applicable to payroll employees as of 1 January 2020.

Specifically for payrolling, the Dismissal Regulation (Ontslagregeling) contains stricter rules for
showing a reasonable ground for termination. For a payroll employer, the fact that the posting of an
employee at the third party ends will not be a reasonable ground to terminate the employment agreement
with such employee. Instead, the situation at the third party will be taken into account to determine
whether a reasonable termination ground exists.

_Outsourcing of self-employed workers_

We are subject to the Dutch law on deregulation of labor relations (Wet deregulering beoordeling
_arbeidsrelaties) (the “DBA”). Pursuant to the DBA, different rules apply depending on whether the_
labor relation is an independent relationship or an employment relationship. For example, in the case of
an employment relationship, the employer must withhold and pay payroll taxes. In addition, the
employer must usually continue to pay wages during illness and vacations. A determination of whether
a relationship is an employment relationship or an independent relationship is made based on all factual
circumstances, including the following three main criteria for establishing an employment relationship:
one party undertakes to (i) perform work personally (ii) under the supervision of the other party (iii) for
remuneration. If the parties (incorrectly) qualify their relationship as an independent relationship rather
than an employment relationship, this can result in specific liabilities for the party that is considered to
be the employer in the event of a re-characterization of the self-employed relationship into an
employment relationship.

_Search and selection services_

Often, in addition to staffing services, staffing solutions providers also provide staff recruitment
services to their commercial clients. The staffing solutions provider can use its pool of job candidates
for their recruitment and also arrange for initial placements. Rendering recruitment services does not
require an additional permit.


-----

_Quality assurance_

We are subject to the professional standards mandated by the _Landelijk Kwaliteitsbureau CBM, a_
professional standards regulator that assesses and oversees quality requirements in relation to
curatorship, guardianship and mentorship.

In addition, a new quality framework has been proposed in 2021 by the Nederlandse Vereniging voor
_Veiligheidskunde (the “NVVK”), a professional association actively involved in promoting safety_
standards. NVVK membership is a requirement for companies engaging in client contracts. Under this
framework, two certifying organizations have been identified to carry out audit on NVVK members.
The scope of the audit process, plan, procedures and reporting requirements are currently still being
developed.

_Data protection_

We are subject to data protection regulations, including the GDPR, in respect of employee personal data
that we process. We occasionally process employee medical data.

**Germany**

In Germany, temporary staffing is regulated by the Act on Staffing (Arbeitnehmeru¨berlassungsgesetz)
(“AÜG”), which has been substantially amended over the years, most recently in 2017. The focus of
the 2017 amendment was to strengthen permanent employment; as a result, a maximum period for
temporary staffing has been introduced and formal requirements have been tightened up as has the equal
pay principle.

**_Primary Regulatory Framework_**

Jurisdiction under AÜG is established where there is a connection to German territory; it thus regulates
both domestic staffing as well as cross-border staffing, for example where job candidates are being
assigned to Germany by foreign staffing solutions providers to perform services on German territory.

_Permits or other authorizations_

In Germany, temporary staffing is generally impermissible without a valid permit from the relevant
authorities. If the staffing solutions provider does not have the permit required, an employment
relationship between the client and the job candidate will be assumed pursuant to the AÜG,
commencing at the time at which the work is to commence as set forth in the agreement between the
client and the staffing solutions provider, unless the job candidate objects and declares to the Federal
Employment Agency a preference to stay with the staffing solutions provider. To protect the client,
German law requires the staffing solutions provider to confirm in the agreement with the client that it
has obtained the necessary permit. Procedurally, permits are typically granted for one-year terms, with
the option to convert into an unlimited term permit following the grant of three consecutive one-year
permits. This permit is specific to the staffing solutions provider. Permits may be denied, or revoked if
already granted, for statutory reasons such as the unreliability of the staffing solutions provider, noncompliance with safety and health regulations, or non-compliance with the AÜG.

_Contractual framework_

The general contractual framework is that a staffing solutions provider concludes an employment
agreement with a job candidate and then places this job candidate with a client. No employment
agreement is concluded between the job candidate and the client, but the client is granted the right to
instruct and direct the job candidate based on an agreement between the staffing solutions provider and
the client (“German Service Agreement”). Additionally, recent changes in the AÜG have imposed
specific mandatory provisions in German Service Agreements, including, as mentioned, a
representation that the aforementioned permit has been granted, a description of the parameters of the


-----

services provided, a description of occupational qualifications, and details regarding working
conditions, such as wages and benefits. The job candidates assigned under the engagement can either
be named in the German Service Agreement itself or separately at a later stage with explicit reference
to the German Service Contract. The German Service Agreement must explicitly be titled a “staffing
agreement” (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsvertrag) and must be signed by wet ink or a qualified electronic
means signature before the job candidate commences at the client.

Since the job candidate remains the staffing solutions provider’s permanent employee, the provider
retains certain obligations from the employment relationship, such as paying the social security
contributions. Moreover, the provider must inform its job candidates before each assignment that they
will be placed as a temporary worker and provide a written copy of the essential contents of the
assignment. Finally, the staffing solutions provider must involve its works council (if there is one) when
the job candidate is hired and dismissed. All such job candidates, being full members of the staffing
solutions provider’s staff, can vote in and run for works council elections.

_Employment terms and compensation_

In order to emphasize the “temporary” nature of temporary staffing, the AÜG amendments provide that
the same job candidate cannot be assigned to the same client for more than 18 consecutive months. A
period of at least three months and one day where the job candidate is not employed at a given client
can reset this maximum 18 month period. Exceptions to this maximum period are only possible by way
of collective bargaining agreements of the client’s industrial sector or works council agreements on the
basis of such collective bargaining agreements.

Though the employment of the job candidate is temporary for the client, all such job candidates must
typically remain employees of the staffing solutions provider under the German Act on Part-Time and
Temporary Employment (Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz), which applies to all temporary employees in
Germany. During the assignment, German law requires the main working conditions of the job
candidate, including the compensation, to be the same as those of a comparable permanent employee.
Compensation comprises everything the job candidate would have been entitled to, had such worker
been hired directly by the client (equal pay), and includes, among other things, holiday pay, sick pay,
allowances and benefits and must be paid by the staffing solutions provider as the employer. Therefore,
the staffing solutions provider has the administrative burden to amend the job candidate’s compensation
with every placement in line with on-site conditions. Derogations from the main working conditions
are possible on the basis of a collective bargaining agreement. However, with regard to equal pay, the
possibility of any derogation is limited, because all job candidates must receive compensation equal to
that of the client’s comparable permanent workers after nine months. A longer derogation period can
only be agreed by collective bargaining agreements granting a gradual increase of the candidate’s to the
level of the permanent employees’ compensation within 15 months, beginning in the seventh week of
the temporary employment. Derogations from equal pay are also never applicable with regard to job
candidates who have been employed by the client (or its group) during the last six months preceding
the placement.

_Termination_

If the staffing solutions provider wishes to terminate a job candidate’s employment agreement after six
months of employment with the staffing solutions provider, it must establish that (i) it has reasonable
grounds for termination; (ii) the job candidate cannot be redeployed to another suitable position with
the staffing solutions provider or with a client within a reasonable period of time; and if the termination
is due to economic reasons, (iii) that termination of employment was the last option. Since the German
legislator wants to ease the transition from temporary to permanent work, it is forbidden for the staffing
solutions provider to agree on a commission fee with the job candidate if the job candidate concludes
an employment contract with the client he has been placed with after his placement. However, the
staffing solutions provider is allowed to invoice the client for a commission fee.


-----

_Liability for damages_

Liability for damages can be provided for in the German Service Agreement between the staffing
solutions provider and the client, so they may agree on a disclaimer of liability in favor of the staffing
solutions provider as well as in favor of the client or they may limit the amount of liabilities to the extent
covered by insurance. Generally, liability for the staffing solutions provider is limited to the selection
of qualification (Auswahlverschulden). The job candidate is liable for breaches of duties towards the
client and the staffing solutions provider on a sliding scale, being fully liable only when he has violated
his duties intentionally.

_Fines, penalties or other enforcements_

Neglecting or violating any of the abovementioned legal requirements can lead to different severe legal
penalties, based on the nature and seriousness of the breach. If the staffing solutions provider has no
permit, the German Service Agreement is not compliant with the formal requirements, or the maximum
staffing period is exceeded, the employment agreement is deemed void and the job candidate is
considered to be an employee of the client, unless the job candidate objects and declares to the Federal
Employment Agency a preference to stay with the staffing solutions provider. In addition, not
complying with the permit regulations may lead to a fine of up to €30,000 for each individual case. The
same fine may be imposed when the maximum staffing period has been exceeded. Higher penalties (up
to €500,000) may be imposed by the German authorities if the equal pay rules have been violated or if
the client has used the job candidate as a replacement for an employee on strike.

Penalties may result from misclassifications of job candidates as self-employed, for example when
placing job candidates with a client as free contractors, consultants, secondees or other similar
arrangements, when they are de facto employees placed under a staffing arrangement. False selfemployment may have severe consequences both in employment and social security law (for example,
obligations to retroactively pay social security contributions for the employer and employee), tax law
(liability for income tax). If the staffing solutions provider is found to have intentionally violated the
law, it may also face criminal law penalties.

There have not yet been many interpretive decisions of the Federal Labor Court of the 2017 amendment
of the AÜG and many details are still in dispute.

_Health and safety obligations_

Job candidates officially assigned to and working for the client are fully integrated into the client’s
organization; as a result, the client must comply with labor and workplace regulations, including any
health and safety regulations with respect to those assigned job candidates. Both the staffing solutions
provider and the client are responsible for the overall well-being of the job candidate including the job
candidate’s physical and mental health, (such as by supervising working times and rest periods,
protecting against unfair treatment and sexual harassment), personal data and (if applicable) his private
working material. The client is required to inform job candidates prior to their assignment of any
specific qualifications and professional skills they need to possess. It is the client’s obligation to inform
the job candidate about dangers the job candidate may face at assignment as well as explain safety
measures.

**_Other Regulatory Frameworks_**

Whereas most of our business is conducted in the regulatory framework outlined above, we are subject
to certain additional regulation based on the specific nature of the services we provide in each
jurisdiction. Below we describe certain features of the relevant laws and regulations that apply to these
specialized services.


-----

_Construction Industry_

Providing staffing services in the construction industry is generally prohibited by law, although it is
possible for a staffing solutions provider who is active in the construction industry to obtain a specific
permit.

_Meat Industry_

Regulations relating to the meat industry has become stricter since 2021, and providing staffing services
in this industry is now allowed only through collective bargain agreement, and it comes with various
other limitations depending on the number of job candidates working at clients.

_Search and Selection Services_

Often, in addition to staffing services, staffing solutions providers also provide staff recruitment
services to their commercial clients. The staffing solutions provider can use its pool of job candidates
for their recruitment and also arrange for initial placements. Rendering recruitment services does not
require an additional permit, but the staffing solutions provider requires a prior trade registration
(Gewerbeanmeldung) for such services.

**France**

The description below sets out the current statutory framework governing our operations in France.

**_Primary Regulatory Framework_**

In France, the loan of a job candidate (worker) to a client is strictly regulated under the French Labor
Code. Except in certain limited circumstances such as temporary staffing (portage salarial; which
requires specific accreditation) or temporary work agencies, loaning workers to a client may only be
provided on a not-for-profit basis; any costs invoiced by the staffing solutions provider to the client
beyond the employee’s salary, social security charges and professional expenses is prohibited.
Additionally, such arrangements require an amendment in the employment contract between the
staffing solutions provider and employee, an inter-company agreement between the client and the
staffing solutions provider, and the consultation and consent of the relevant works councils.

_Permits or other authorizations_

Staffing solutions providers using the contractual framework described below do not require any permit
or authorization for their business in France, other than standard registrations applicable to every
company operating in France with its own employees.

_Contractual framework_

Staffing solutions providers may offer consultants or job candidates to a client on a temporary and forprofit basis under the framework of a services agreement (contrat de prestation de services), given
certain conditions. A qualifying services agreement encompasses temporary services provided to a
client specific to a certain project, involving specialized skills, techniques, or know-how. Additionally,
for workers to be provided on a for-profit basis under a services agreement, their labor must be closely
related to the main purpose or project of the services agreement and be included within the broader
services being provided by the staffing solutions provider to the client.

Key factors as to whether a for-profit staffing under a services agreement complies with the regulatory
requirements are the following:

- Specific know-how of the service provider: the services must require specialized skills or knowhow not existing within the client.


-----

- Authority over job candidates: even if the services must be performed in coordination with the
management of the client, the service provider must retain authority over the job candidates
assigned to a client.

- Equipment to carry out the work: the services provider must have and use its own equipment,
such as gloves, shoes, glasses and safety harness, to carry out the work, and the client must not
lend the equipment necessary to provide the agreed services.

_Employment terms and compensation_

Compensation: must be calculated on a flat-fee basis and may not be calculated on an hourly rate basis,
as this would suggest that the provision of services is limited to the provision of labor.

_Termination_

Termination of employment agreements is governed by standard rules and regulations applicable to
every company operating in France with its own employees. If the staffing solutions provider has
entered into an indefinite-term employment agreement with the job candidate, the employment contract
can be terminated by the staffing solutions provider for real and serious cause at any time provided that
the applicable notice period is complied with. The staffing solutions provider and the job candidate can
also enter into a mutual termination agreement, which would then be ratified by the labor authorities.
Finally, the job candidate may also resign from their position provided that the applicable notice period
is complied with.

If the staffing solutions provider has entered into a fixed-term employment contract with the job
candidate, the employment contract can only be prematurely terminated (1) if the parties so agree, (2)
in case of gross misconduct, (3) in case of force majeure, (4) if the employee is declared unfit to work
by the occupational doctor, or (5) if the employee has found an indefinite-term employment. In any
other cases, the employment contract runs its course until its initially-set termination date.

_Liability for damages_

Under French law, the client is liable for all damages done to a third party, on the worksite or during
work. However, staffing solutions providers remain liable for costs related to injuries caused by
occupational accidents suffered by its in-house employees in the course of their work.

_Fines, penalties or other enforcements_

If the abovementioned contractual framework is not complied with, the services agreement could be
qualified as an illicit loan of workers or the criminal offence of bargaining, for which the client and the
staffing solutions providers (including their respective legal representatives) can be held criminally
liable. Penalties for such violations can carry a maximum fine of €375,000 and other potential penalties
for a client or staffing solutions provider, and a maximum fine of €75,000 or a maximum prison sentence
of five years for the legal representatives of the client or service provider.

_Health and safety obligations_

As job candidates are officially assigned to and working on the client’s premises, the client must comply
with labor and workplace regulations with respect to assigned job candidates, such as health and safety
regulations. In this respect, if protection equipment must be worn by the job candidates, such equipment
must be provided by the staffing solutions providers. Obligations relating to occupational medical
surveillance are also the responsibility of the staffing solutions providers.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

From time to time, we may enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates and in the
ordinary course of our business with certain of our shareholders, senior management as well as entities
in which our shareholders or senior management hold ownership interests. These transactions may
include, among others, financing arrangements, lease agreements, shareholder arrangements and
commercial arrangements. We have also in the past entered into transactions with entities that may be
deemed to be affiliates because the Group holds a minority stake in such entities. In addition, entities
within our Group enter into financing and cash pooling agreements. We believe these agreements are
on terms no more favorable to the related parties or our affiliates than what they would expect to
negotiate with disinterested third-parties. In addition, it is contemplated that new related party
transactions will be entered into in connection with the Transactions.

Below is a brief summary of certain material transactions among our related parties during the periods
under review:

On September 30, 2021, Vialegis sold its shares to Redmore for a total consideration of €22.0 million.
Following this transaction, Vialegis became part of Redmore and ceased to be a separate operational
company. €18.4 million of the total consideration was paid on September 30, 2021.

On October 1, 2021, GRITT sold its shares in ETA to Abylsen for a total consideration of €22.1 million,
including a negative earn-out clause of up to €6.3 million. As a result of this transaction, certain GRITT
tracking shares were converted into Abylsen tracking shares.

See note 34 of our 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

**Management Incentive Plan**

On the Acquisition Closing Date, we established the structure for a management equity participation
program pursuant to which certain managers of the Group will be able to acquire, subscribe for or
otherwise receive MIP Securities and such managers have entered into certain customary
documentation (the “Management Incentive Plan”). In connection with the Acquisition, we settled our
previous long-term incentive plan at the House of HR level.

**Management Service Agreement**

On November 4, 2022, House of HR entered into a management service agreement pursuant to which
an entity controlled by Conny Vandendriessche receives annual compensation for, among other things,
the promotion of the interests and business of the Group, and will be compensated for certain expenses
(such as networking events, VOKA memberships, etc.). Each of Bain Capital and Naxicap (as long as
it is holding at least 5% of the ordinary shares and fixed-return preferred shares issued by Holdco on a
fully diluted basis) will be entitled to invoice portfolio monitoring fees as well as ad hoc fees for work
performed in connection with exceptional assignments such as acquisitions and refinancings.

comply with the restricted payments covenant.

The Revolving Credit Facility shall not be entitled to any mandatory prepayment proceeds (other than
a mandatory prepayment as a result of a Change of Control).

If a lender waives its right (such right shall be at the Issuer’s request only) to receive its share of any

retained by the Senior Secured Group for any purposes not prohibited by the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement (including restricted payments), may be offered to any lender(s) selected by the
Issuer which did not decline such prepayment or applied in prepayment of any other permitted
indebtedness.

Cure”) so that the Test Condition is no longer satisfied. The EBITDA Cure equity cure right may not
be exercised on more than five occasions during the term of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement and no more than two EBITDA Cures may be made in any three consecutive relevant
periods. Such Equity Cure must be exercised prior to the date falling 20 Business Days after the date
on which the compliance certificate is required to be delivered.

There shall be no obligation to use any Cure Amount (other than with respect to a Prepayment Cure) in
prepayment of the Senior Secured Facilities.

If the Financial Covenant has been breached, but is complied with when tested on any subsequent Test
Date or is otherwise not required to be tested due to the Test Condition not being met on any subsequent


-----

date, then, the prior breach of such Financial Covenant or any event of default arising therefrom shall
be deemed cured unless the requisite super-majority lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility have
exercised their acceleration rights to declare all or part of the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility
to be immediately due and payable.

The Issuer may elect to re-test the Test Condition or Financial Covenant for any period at any time
based upon any financial statements (including the latest internally available financial information for
an LTM period) and, if the Test Condition is not met or the Financial Covenant is complied with at such
time (due to prepayments of the RCF, cash or cash equivalents on balance sheet or otherwise), the
Financial Covenant shall be deemed complied with and any prior breach of such Financial Covenant or
any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed cured. For any such calculation, the Issuer may
give pro forma effect to all applicable transactions (and permitted adjustments to any Applicable Metric
in connection therewith) for which the Applicable Transaction Date has occurred following the end of
the Applicable Period or any subsequent Relevant Period as if such Applicable Transaction had been
consummated on the first day of such Applicable Period or Relevant Period (as applicable).

its affiliates) as second lien agent and Elavon Financial Services DAC as security agent (“Second Lien
Facility Agreement”), which provides for a second lien term loan facility in a principal amount of
€310,000,000 (“Original Second Lien Facility”).

Incremental facilities may also be established under the Second Lien Facility Agreement from time to
time (including as new or existing facility commitment(s) and/or as an additional tranche or class of, or
an increase or an extension of, any existing facility or a previously incurred Additional Second Lien
Facility) (“Incremental Second Lien Facilities” and, together with the Original Second Lien Facility,
the “Second Lien Facilities”).

**_Borrowers, Currencies and utilizations_**

The Original Second Lien Facility may be utilized by the Issuer and Finco or certain of the Issuer’s
restricted subsidiaries which accede to the Second Lien Facility Agreement as additional borrowers of
that facility (the “Second Lien Facility Borrowers”).

**_Purpose_**

All amounts borrowed under the Original Second Lien Facility shall be applied directly or indirectly,
in or towards (including by way of on-lending to, or investment in, any other member of the Senior
Secured Group or Company Group), refinancing any interim facility if drawn and otherwise applied in
or towards (directly or indirectly): (i) financing or refinancing consideration paid or payable for the

in or for any other purpose contemplated by the tax structure memorandum and the funds flow statement
(if any) or otherwise arising in connection with the Transaction; (v) financing other related amounts,
including fees, costs and expenses and other Transaction Costs; and/or (vi) to the extent not applied for
a purpose set out in sub-paragraphs (i) to (v) above, financing or refinancing the general corporate
purposes and/or working capital requirements of the Senior Secured Group.


-----

**_Availability_**

The Original Second Lien Facility was fully utilized on the Acquisition Closing Date. Utilizations of
the Original Second Lien Facility were subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Original Second Lien Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR plus an applicable margin. If EURIBOR, is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be
zero in respect of loans made under Original Second Lien Facility.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% per annum on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under the Original Second Lien Facility will be repaid in full on the date that is eight
years from the Acquisition Closing Date.

**_Voluntary and Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Second Lien Facility Agreement permits voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to de minimis
amounts and the call protection applicable to the Original Second Lien Facility) and requires mandatory
prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including, upon the occurrence of a Change of
Control (as defined in the Second Lien Facility Agreement which follows terms substantially similar to
the Notes as described in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”), each second lien lender shall
be entitled to require prepayment of outstanding amounts (including accrued interest and all other
amounts accrued or owing to such lender) and cancellation of its undrawn commitments within a
prescribed time period. A change of control shall include:

- any person or group (other than one or more permitted holders) becoming the beneficial owner
of more than 50% of the voting power of the Issuer other than in connection with a transaction
or series of transactions in which the Issuer shall become the wholly owned subsidiary of a
Parent Entity (as defined in the Second Lien Facility Agreement) subject to certain conditions;

- Topco ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued share capital of the Issuer (or in each
case any successor entity as a result of certain mergers permitted under the Second Lien Facility
Agreement);

- on a disposal of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Group taken as a whole
to a person other than a restricted subsidiary or one or more permitted holders, subject to
applicable exemptions.

At the Issuer’s option, the Issuer may prepay any other indebtedness of the Senior Secured Group which
is permitted (including, junior or junior secured indebtedness) in priority if such prepayment would
comply with the restricted payments covenant.

If a second lien lender waives its right (such right shall be at the Issuer’s request only) to receive its
share of any prepayment of the Second Lien Facilities (“Waived Amounts”), such Waived Amounts
may be retained by the Senior Secured Group for any purposes not prohibited by the Second Lien
Facility Agreement (including restricted payments), may be offered to any second lien lender(s) selected
by the Issuer which did not decline such prepayment or applied in prepayment of any other permitted
indebtedness.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

_Guarantor Coverage Test and Material Subsidiaries_


-----

The Second Lien Facilities will be guaranteed by each borrower of the Second Lien Facilities (the
“Borrowers”) and the Guarantors (together, the “Second Lien Obligors”).

The Second Lien Facility Agreement includes a Guarantor Coverage Test and Material Subsidiary
threshold (as described at “—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement—Guarantees and Securities”
above) which are to be complied with prior to March 3, 2023 and thereafter on an ongoing basis within
120 days of the last date on which the annual financial statements of the Issuer (or other applicable
financial reporting entity) are required to be delivered to the agent under the Second Lien Facility
Agreement.

The Second Lien Facility Agreement is secured by the same security interests granted as security for
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. See “—Senior Secured Credit facilities Agreement—
_Guarantees and Securities” above, but with such ranking and priority applicable to Second Lien_
Liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement (see section entitled “—Intercreditor Agreement”).

_Release of Guarantees and Security_

In addition to the circumstances described below under “—Intercreditor Agreement—Distressed
_Disposals” and “—Intercreditor Agreement—Non-distressed Disposals,” the Issuer may, subject to_
certain conditions, request the release of a guarantor from its guarantee under the Second Lien Facility
Agreement if (i) such guarantor is the subject of a third-party disposal or other permitted activity under
the Second Lien Facility Agreement pursuant to which such guarantor will cease to be a member of the
Senior Secured Group, (ii) on a pro forma basis taking into account such release, the Guarantor
Coverage Test will continue to be satisfied or (iii) the second lien lenders whose commitments under
the Second Lien Facility Agreement aggregate greater than 50% of the total commitments under such
facilities consent to such release. Upon the effectiveness of a release pursuant to the foregoing sentence,
the applicable guarantor would have no further obligations under the Second Lien Facility Agreement,
including any obligations to grant Security in any Collateral owned by such guarantor.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and
the other matters set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

-----

certain existing indebtedness of House of HR and finance or refinance amounts drawn in connection
with certain acquisitions closed in 2022 and (iii) pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection

**_Maturity and Extension_**

The Bridge Facility governed by the Bridge Facility Agreement initially matures on November 3, 2023
(the “Conversion Date”), when, absent the occurrence of certain events of default thereunder, the
obligations under the Bridge Facility Agreement will automatically convert into a long-term loan
maturing on November 3, 2029. Following the Conversion Date, the lenders may, subject to certain
conditions, exchange their long-term loans for senior secured notes bearing substantially the same terms
as the Notes.

Facility and subject to a de minimis amount and other customary carve outs substantially similar to the
Notes as described in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”; (ii) prior to the Conversion Date,
with the proceeds of certain financings incurred by the Group; and (iii) upon the occurrence of a Change
of Control (as defined in the Bridge Facility Agreement which follows terms substantially similar to the
Notes as described in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”), each bridge facility lender shall
be entitled to require prepayment of outstanding amounts (including accrued interest and all other
amounts accrued or owing to such lender) and cancellation of its undrawn commitments within a
prescribed time period. A change of control shall include:

- any person or group (other than one or more permitted holders) becoming the beneficial owner of
more than 50% of the voting power of the Issuer other than in connection with a transaction or
series of transactions in which the Issuer shall become the wholly owned subsidiary of a Parent
Entity (as defined in the Second Lien Facility Agreement) subject to certain conditions; and

- on a disposal of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Group taken as a whole to
a person other than a restricted subsidiary or one or more permitted holders, subject to applicable
exemptions.


-----

At the Issuer’s option, the Issuer may prepay any other indebtedness of the Senior Secured Group which
is permitted (including, junior or junior secured indebtedness) in priority if such prepayment would
comply with the restricted payments covenant.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Bridge Facility is guaranteed by the Issuer and the Original Guarantor, and on or prior to March 3,
2023, subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material
limitations pursuant to applicable laws, will be guaranteed by the Post-Closing Guarantors. The Bridge

not (i) incur indebtedness under the first paragraph of the covenant described under “Description of the

of default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods (with such grace periods
capable of being extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent the relevant event
of default is subject to litigation), including: (i) misrepresentation; and (ii) material invalidity and
unlawfulness of the Bridge Facility financing documents.

**_Governing Law_**

The Bridge Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with

that the Bridge Facility Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
certain Guarantors and the Trustee are party to and certain other Guarantors will accede to an
Intercreditor Agreement dated as of October 30, 2022 between, among others, the agents, arrangers and
lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement
and the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third
Party Security Provider (as defined below), when payments can be made in respect of debt of the
Debtors or Third Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt,
the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events and turnover provisions and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement.
It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document
because it, and not the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes, of the
Trustee and of the Security Agent. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings
given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the purposes of this description “Senior Secured Group” shall mean the Issuer and any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, setoff, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing
arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any
New Debt Financing, each agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent
(and each other person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction
Security document) is authorized and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document,
amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from the Transaction


-----

Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) and/or to effect the ranking,
priority guarantees and Security of the New Debt Financing, subject to certain conditions, including as
regards the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise required by the Issuer, substantially
the same (if applicable) as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the
Finance Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its

otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of or shares (or other
ownership interests) in any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together
an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in
respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence
of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be
granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist
and there is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of
any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities
(including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a
contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under
the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), (ii) over
any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any
Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction
Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of
such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation
relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any
payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the
benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

acceleration events under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a member of the Senior Secured Group,
payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers and received by creditors in
accordance with the provisions described below under “—Application of Proceeds” provided that after
the Designation Date there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than
those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of
assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following
an acceleration event as required by the ICA shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of default
under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien

-----

Security Providers may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien
Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject
to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

document or Senior Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These
payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii)
of the next paragraph.

the Senior Secured Group may only make specified scheduled payments (including any other direct or

and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower under
any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph
(L) below) irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt
facilities have accelerated their debt, the payment is not prohibited to be made
at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without
double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one (1) Business
Day after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured
Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities
(a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super
Senior Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the
relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco
Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”)
advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and
suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after delivery of that
Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original
scheduled maturity of the relevant Topco Liabilities;


-----

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of
that Topco Payment Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period
expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien
Event of Default has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever
of the Super Senior Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien
Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered)
delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes
Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco
_Enforcement” below)._

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured
Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than forty five (45) days after the occurrence
of the relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with
respect to the same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of three hundred and sixty (360)
days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of
a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any
Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the
liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the
applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The
accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall
continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

**_Cure of Payment Stop_**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the
occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as
the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco
Creditors or any party that has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a
creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco Investors”) (in respect of
the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco


-----

Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment
Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco
Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result
of that suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being
required.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien
Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the
“Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured
Creditor on or after the Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt Documents other than any
payment or distribution which is either (x) not prohibited under the
Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents (I) after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a
result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other
litigation or a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any
Third Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the
occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, other
than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance
with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in
accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of
_Proceeds”; or_

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation
to, any of the liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured
Group or Third Party Security Provider which is not in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made
as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that
Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,
that creditor will:

(vi) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of setoff (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities
(or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on
behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute


-----

that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount
equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the
relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(vii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off,
promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after
the Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or
recovers from any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider
(x) any proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or
following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the
charged property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the
Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of
_Proceeds.”_

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Debtor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any
resolution or making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or
reorganization (excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its
indebtedness, (c) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator,
compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (d) any analogous
procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious
proceedings, proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or
unsuccessful or as permitted under any Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second
Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party
Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the
extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the
distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties
have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance
with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities
to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in
the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts
constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting
from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are
discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set
out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make
demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery


-----

after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group
or Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably
requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent
of an Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable)
otherwise as specified in the provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors;

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge
Date, the Majority Second Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date,
the Majority Topco Creditors; and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on
which the Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the
“Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior Secured Creditors (other than the
Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the Senior Secured
Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior
Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50%
of the Super Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”)
save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of
Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the
enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security
_Prior to the Designation Date” and “—Enforcement of Transaction Security_
_on or After the Designation Date” below;_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior
Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority
Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date,
Topco Creditors representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the
“Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither
to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting


-----

on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors
to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date,
the Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions
or have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any
Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco
Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the
Instructing Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding
paragraph may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from
enforcing, the Transaction Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time
the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the
Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security do not give such instruction or do not
indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit and the Security
Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii)
the Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in
good faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security
Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement,
before giving any such instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement
action the creditors represented by an Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other
agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such
enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of up to ten Business Days or take any
Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group will only be entitled to give
the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such
Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction
Security unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If
the Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of
those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents,
trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
(ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement
action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until
the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not
made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue
and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction
Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions
before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior
to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given


-----

instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B)
required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee
in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen
under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as
applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or
cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors). Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or
representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent
instructions do not give such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group
is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions
to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall
act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that
(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of
enforcement chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds
must be received in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not
carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is
so requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from
a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with
its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or
refrain from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator
of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent at the direction
of the Majority Super Senior Creditors) as any persons entitled at any time under the above provisions
shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may
include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the
Transaction Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security
Documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than
the Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with
the paragraphs above.

_Payment of the French Soulte_


-----

If, following the enforcement of any shares or securities pledged under a Security Document governed
by French law by way of appropriation or foreclosure (a “Foreclosure”), a French Soulte (being the
amount by which the value of the shares or securities being appropriated, foreclosed or transferred
exceeds the amount of the relevant secured obligations) becomes due to any Debtor by a Secured Party,
such French Soulte shall only become due and payable by the Secured Parties on the earlier of the date
falling nine (9) months after the date on which such Foreclosure occurs and the Final Discharge Date.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

and (G) the taking of any action by a member of the Topco Group not prohibited by the Finance
Documents.

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors’ will not apply
in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security
securing the Topco Group Liabilities, if:


-----

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement (the “Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities, and Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the
Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the
Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee or the
Topco Borrower;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill
Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes
Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice
notifying any agent under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of
such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a
Topco Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the
earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after the Topco
Standstill Start Date (the “Topco Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation
to a particular Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the
Topco Creditors or a Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds
Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same Enforcement Action in
relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the
Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against
any other member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security
Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include
action taken to preserve or protect any security as opposed to realize
it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular
Topco Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such
first mentioned Topco Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs

Secured Creditors and the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have
given their consent to the relevant Enforcement Action.

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may
take Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement)
in relation to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at


-----

any later time, a further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in
respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may, by
giving not less than 10 days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, elect to purchase all, but not
part of, the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities,
Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes
Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such
date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to hedging
obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions)
for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated
on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it
shall (and is irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement,
instruction, direction, confirmation, payment, certification or other document, request or information
from any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from
the Issuer to the Security Agent:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any
asset which the Issuer has confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or
where any applicable release and/ or consent has been
obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a
disposal to a member of the Senior Secured Group but without
prejudice to any obligation of any member of the Senior
Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement
security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance
Documents or where any applicable release and/or consent has
been obtained under the applicable Finance Document
pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by
a member of the Senior Secured Group; and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal
(as defined below) (in each case, a “Non-Distressed
Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any
document or other agreement requested in order for any member of the
Senior Secured Group to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that
such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect any
amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with
any obligations or take any action in relation to such document or
agreement;


-----

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any
asset of any member of the Senior Secured Group which has ceased or
will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor simultaneously with such release
to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to be a
Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance
Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any
other asset to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that such security
is not required to be given or such release is otherwise, in accordance
with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement);

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interests in a Debtor, other
member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor
or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, other member of the
Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be
a member of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of
that Debtor or other member of the Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries
from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents and
the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt
Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt Document); and

(iii) effect a Debt Transfer (as defined below).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii) above, the Issuer
shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited
as at the date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive
agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant
release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed
Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member
of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco
Group or a Debtor, to the extent the Issuer has confirmed in writing to the Security Agent that such
disposal or other transaction or designation is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member
of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such
person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document to
the applicable creditors concurrently with ceasing to be a member of the Topco Group or Debtor; and
any right to decline, delay or prevent any prepayment in any Debt Document shall be disapplied to the
extent that if exercised such right would prevent the repayment of all such liabilities in full by such
person (but without prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break costs or other
payment required by the relevant Finance Documents).

The Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender
Liabilities (each, a “Borrower”) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise
transferred by that Borrower (a “Debt Transfer”) provided that (i) either (A) such Debt Transfer is to
another member of the Senior Secured Group; (b) such Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that


-----

Borrower or any holding company of that Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance
Documents, and (II) the proceeds of such disposal are not otherwise required to be applied
unconditionally in prepayment of that Borrower’s liabilities under the applicable Finance Documents;
or (C) such Debt Transfer is undertaken in connection with an IPO, and (ii) the transferee in respect of
such Debt Transfer is another borrower under the Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities,
Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien lender Liabilities (as applicable). Any Debt
Transfer may (and shall upon the request of the Issuer) be effected on a cashless basis, by way of book
entries and not as physical cash movement to repay and reborrow any applicable liabilities.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by
a member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or
shares or financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a)
at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become
enforceable as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for
enforcement was made, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration
event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made, or (c) after the occurrence
of an acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security as a result of an acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing, by a Debtor or Third
Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Senior Secured Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized
(subject to acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below) at the cost of the relevant Debtor,
Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or
Debtor:

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and
execute and deliver or enter into any release of that Transaction Security or
claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any
consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent (in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), be considered necessary or
desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to
release (A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part
of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security
granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets,
and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor,
Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the
assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors,
Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding
company of a Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary
of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or
other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company
or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any
other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor
or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or
the holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the


-----

liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their subsidiaries
to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the
“Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party
for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver
or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities,
provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt
Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a
Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed
to the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers
and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or
the holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security
Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to
transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that
Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to
any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group
liabilities or liabilities to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intragroup lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on
behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the
Disposed Entity which is also a Guarantor of the Senior Secured
Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on
behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed
to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an
enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred,
as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the
prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone
any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled
to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent


-----

is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities,
guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be
paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash
management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable
to the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to
give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is
not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities,
guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien
Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other
Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of
any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility,
made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately
following that release.

Where borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the provisions
described above, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities
transferred to a holding company of the Issuer specified by such creditor, in which case the Security
Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as
are required to so transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant
to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the
consent of each Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained,
it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that:

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in
cash); and

(ii) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made (A)
pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process conducted with
the advice of a reputable, independent and internationally recognized
investment bank or firm of accountants or (if all such banks or firms are
conflicted), a reputable, independent and internationally recognized third party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations of
businesses or assets similar or comparable to those subject to the relevant
Transaction Security) and, in each case, not being an auditor or administrator
or other relevant officer of the applicable company (a “Financial Advisor”) as
selected by the Security Agent (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent
has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Advisor until it has been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), in respect of
which the Secured Creditors are entitled to participate (a “Competitive Sales
Process”); or (B) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has
delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured
Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the
Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors
on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection
with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into
account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it
being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or
engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured
and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).


-----

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities and/or Transaction
Security securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved
the release, transfer or disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second
Lien Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially
all in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing,
guarantee and (to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement)
other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors and Unsecured
Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold
or disposed of (a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent)
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or its
affiliates), and all security under documents creating security in
respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the assets of such
members of the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale,
provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee
(acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Senior
Secured Creditors will recover a greater cash amount if such Relevant
Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates
and not released or discharged and provided such amount is
nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Senior
Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case if there are
no bidders) or if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee
(acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona
fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in
excess of the outstanding amount of Senior Secured Liabilities and
serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,
then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and
transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is
made pursuant to a Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial
Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion
(including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which
can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior
Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors
on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in
connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of
view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the
method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent
has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it
has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs and (v) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction Security


-----

securing Topco Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the provisions
described above, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Topco Liabilities has approved the
release, transfer or disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Topco
Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially
all in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing,
guarantee and (to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement)
other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors and Unsecured
Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold
or disposed of (a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent)
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or its
affiliates), and all security under documents creating security in
respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the assets of such
members of the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale,
provided that, if each Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and
each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting
reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Priority Secured
Parties will recover a greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim is
sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates and not
released or discharged and provided such amount is nevertheless less
than the aggregate amount of outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities,
which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each
Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee
in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting reasonably and in
good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed
bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding
amount of the Priority Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice
on the Security Agent confirming the same, then the Security Agent
shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim
to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is
made pursuant to a Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial
Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion
(including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which
can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior
Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors
on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in
connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of
view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the
method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent
has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it
has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction).

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall always act (i) if the
relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in


-----

accordance with the provisions set out under “—Manner of Enforcement” above, and (ii) in any other
case on the instructions of the Instructing Group or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security
Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

**Equitably Subordinated Creditors**

Notwithstanding the provisions described above under “—Order of Application—Transaction Security”
and “—Order of Application—Topco Independent Transaction Security,” to the extent that the
Recoveries held by the Security Agent are insufficient to discharge the liabilities owed to all creditors
in any class of creditors and this is due to any creditor (“Equitably Subordinated Creditor”) whose
commitments, any other participation rights (including by way of sub-participation) and/or any other
rights and claims under the Debt Documents against a Debtor incorporated in Germany which, prior to
or in an insolvency of the Debtor, would be subordinated or would be subject to avoidance claims
pursuant to certain provisions under the German Insolvency Code or the German Avoidance Act (unless
other applicable laws or regulations in force from time to time provide that no such subordination would
apply or avoidance claim would exist) (“Equitably Subordinated Liabilities”) being part of that class of
creditors, the amount to be applied by the Security Agent in discharge of the liabilities of that class of


-----

creditors shall be distributed first to the other creditors of that class until the liabilities owed to such
creditors in the class of creditors of the Equitably Subordinated Creditor have been discharged in full
and then to that Equitably Subordinated Creditor.

An Equitably Subordinated Creditor will not have the benefit (but will still be subject to the obligations
under any sharing or equalization or turnover provisions in the Debt Documents) and will not be entitled
to receive any payment or distribution and neither the Security Agent nor the agent nor any creditor
shall be required to make any payment or distribution or turnover under or in connection with the Debt
Documents in respect of any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities, in each case until the liabilities owed
to the other creditors in the class of creditors of the Equitably Subordinated Creditor have been
discharged in full.

To the extent that any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities would result in the subordination of liabilities
towards any other creditors under any Debt Document or prejudice the validity or enforceability of any
Transaction Security or guarantee and/or indemnity provided to any creditor under the Debt Documents
in any way (in each case unless other applicable laws or regulations in force from time to time provide
that no such subordination would apply or be prejudicial for the validity or enforceability of any
Transaction Security or guarantee and/or indemnity), the relevant Equitably Subordinated Creditor will
be deemed not to be a Secured Party under any document creating Transaction Security and will not
benefit from the guarantee or indemnity.

**Equalization**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after
the first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the
resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their
respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that
specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments
amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position
that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**Required Consents**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended
or waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the
Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class
of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or
adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the
relevant agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class (or in the case of hedging counterparties,
each affected hedge counterparty) shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order
of priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of

(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance
documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the
Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed
amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations
of any other creditor or class of creditors other than the Cash Management
Facility Lenders (solely in their capacity as such)),


-----

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or
waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such
hedge counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or
class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity
as such)), and

(iv) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such
instructions or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented
or authorized to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or
trustee in its capacity as such).

**_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_**

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security
Agent (a) may, if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of
or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security which shall be binding on each party, and (b) may if the Issuer consents, and shall promptly
upon request of the Issuer, amend, release and/or retake any document creating Transaction Security
where such amendment, release and/or retake is required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or
priority of the relevant Transaction Security, together with any related or consequential waiver
(including by reason of a failure to register any relevant document with Companies House within the
prescribed time limit set out in section 859 of the Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security
Agent shall also irrevocably waive any payment or other obligation or default arising out of such failure
to register) and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding on each Party.

Where any such amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security would adversely affect the nature or scope of the
assets subject to Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be)
or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security are distributed, such amendment may not be made without the prior consent of:

(i) each of the agents or trustees other than an agent under any Cash Management
Facility, if appointed (acting in accordance with the relevant finance
documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the
Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender or the agent for the relevant Cash
Management Facility on its behalf but only to the extent that the proposed
amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor
Agreement in their capacity as such and would not materially adversely affect
the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors,

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or
waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such
hedge counterparty under the under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or
class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity
as such)), and

(iv) the Issuer.


-----

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such
(including any ability of that Security Agent to act pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be
effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers:
_Transaction Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement,_
relating in particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security, claims or liabilities, or (ii) any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security
Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence
of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,” “—Non_Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or_
consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such
matters can be effected solely by the Issuer and the Security Agent.

**_Snooze/Lose_**

If in relation to:

(i) a request for a consent in relation to any of the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which
does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which applies a longer
period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(ii) a request to participate in any vote of a class of creditors under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt Document other than a notes
indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(iii) a request to approve any other action under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which
does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which applies a longer
period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement); or

(iv) a request to provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which
does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which applies a longer
period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement), then, in each case,
any creditor:

(A) fails to respond to that request within ten (10) Business Days (or any
other period of time notified by the Company, with the prior agreement
of the Agents if the period for this provision to operate is less than ten
(10) Business Days) of that request being made; or

(B) fails to provide details of its participation within the timescale
specified by the Security Agent:

1. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s
participation (as the case may be) shall be deemed to be zero
for the purpose of calculating their participation in respect of
the matter when ascertaining whether any relevant percentage
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of their
participation or has been obtained to give that consent, carry
that vote or approve that action;


-----

2. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s
status shall be disregarded for the purposes of ascertaining
whether the agreement of any specified group of creditors has
been obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or approve
that action; and

3. in the case of paragraph (iv) above, that confirmation or
notification shall be deemed to have been given, provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, this Snooze/Loose clause shall
not apply to any Noteholder in respect of any request where
such Noteholder is not given the option to respond to such
request in the negative but shall otherwise apply to all
Noteholders.

**_Provisions Following an IPO_**

On or following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding
company thereof) (an “IPO Event”), the Issuer is entitled to give notice to each agent and each hedge
counterparty (a “Pushdown Notice”) that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate
(with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “IPO Pushdown Date”)) so
that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to
the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or
whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes
are not refinanced in full on or before the IPO Pushdown Date, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any
holding company of the Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the
IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) each reference in the Debt Documents to the Issuer or any holding company
of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent
applicable and unless the context requires otherwise) (iv) certain provisions of the Debt Documents
(including representations, undertakings and events of default), will cease to apply to any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall directly or indirectly result in a breach of any representation,
warranty, undertaking of event of default, (vi) each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall
be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations and restrictions under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security) and (viii)
unless otherwise notified by the Issuer, each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider,
Investor (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor
will be irrevocably and unconditionally released from its obligations and restrictions under the
Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders
under and as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50%
of any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility
and noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant
IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor
and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case,
borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any
amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

**_Agreement to Override_**


-----

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other
Debt Document (other than any Transaction Security Documents which are governed by German law
and which need to be notarized).

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the €300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of     % Senior
Secured Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by Villa Dutch Bidco B.V., a private
limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aanpsrakelijkheid) organized and
existing under the laws of the Netherlands, having its corporate seat in Amsterdam, with address
Strawinskylaan 1209, 1077 XX Amsterdam, and trade register number 86433792 (the “Issuer”). For
purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” (i) the “Issuer” refers only to Villa Dutch Bidco B.V., and
none of its subsidiaries, (ii) “House of HR” refers to House of HR NV, and “House of HR Group” refers
to House of HR, together with its Subsidiaries, and (iii) “Group” refers to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries. The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this
“Description of the Notes” as so defined.

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date,
among, inter alios, the Issuer, the Original Guarantor (as defined herein), U.S. Bank Trustees Limited,
as trustee (the “Trustee”), and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as security agent (the “Security Agent”).
The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of a conflict between the Indenture, the
Notes or the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect
of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain
indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for
amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

The Issuer will not be required to, nor does the Issuer currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes
for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for
resale under the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or incorporate by reference
or include, or be subject to, any provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof.
Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture, and the Holders will not
be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued
under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the
event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

The proceeds from the Offering will be used, together with cash on hand, (i) to partially repay amounts
drawn under the Bridge Facility (including accrued and unpaid interest thereon), which were used,
together with the proceeds from Facility B and the Second Lien Facility, the Shareholder Equity
Contribution and other cash sources, to finance the Acquisition, to repay or refinance the certain existing
debt and obligations of the House of HR Group, as cash overfunding (which may be used for general
corporate purposes) and to pay certain fees and expenses in connection therewith and (ii) to pay fees
and expenses in connection with the Offering and the Refinancing, as set forth under the caption “Use
_of Proceeds.”_

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer
and the Original Guarantor and will not be guaranteed by any other Subsidiary of the Issuer. On or prior
to March 3, 2023, and subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and to certain
material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Post-Closing Guarantors (as defined below) are
expected to accede to the Indenture (as defined below) and the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantee
the Notes on a senior secured basis.


-----

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and refers to the Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents. Because this is a summary, it may
not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read each of the Indenture, the
Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents in their entirety. Copies of
such documents are available as described under “Where You Can Find Other Information.”

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

The Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including its obligations in respect of the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Bridge Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or other liabilities of the
Issuer and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to
the extent of the property and value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or liabilities;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities,
including preferred stock and obligations to trade creditors, of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
are not Guarantors;

- be guaranteed on a senior basis (i) on the Issue Date, by the Original Guarantor and (ii) on or
prior to March 3, 2023, subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and
to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Post-Closing Guarantors; and

- be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by certificated Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below), when granted, will:

- be a general senior obligation of the Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor
that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor, including
its obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Bridge Facility and certain
Hedging Obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that
is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or other liabilities of such
Guarantor and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes
or the Note Guarantees to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or
liabilities; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities,
including preferred stock and obligations to trade creditors, of Subsidiaries of such Guarantor
that are not Guarantors.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S.


-----

Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit,
financial assistance and other laws and be further limited as required under the Agreed Security
Principles.

As of September 30, 2022, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated
Subsidiaries would have had total as adjusted Indebtedness (including lease liabilities, net of sublease
receivables, amounting to €160.3 million) in a nominal amount of €2,022.3 million, including €1,549.1
million of Indebtedness secured on the Charged Property on a first-priority basis, consisting of €1,134.1
million of drawings under Facility B and the Delayed Drawn Term Facility, €300.0 million under the
Notes and €115.0 million under the Bridge Facility, and €310.0 million of Indebtedness secured on the
Charged Property on a second-priority basis under the Second Lien Facility. The Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement also includes the €250.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of
_Other Indebtedness.”_

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The
Notes will mature on       , 2029. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Euroclear and
Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing Systems” and each, a “Relevant Clearing System”)
are not required to monitor or enforce the minimum amount. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests
in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of the Relevant
Clearing Systems, as applicable. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business
Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled
to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of         % per annum and will be payable, in cash in
euros, semi-annually in arrears on        and          of each year, commencing on      , 2023.
The Issuer will make each interest payment for so long as the Notes are global Notes to the Holders of
record at the close of business (in Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable) on the Clearing System
Business Day immediately before the due date for such payment, where “Clearing System Business
Day” means a day on which the Relevant Clearing System for which the global note representing the
Notes is being held is open for business, or to the extent Definitive Registered Notes have been issued,
Holders of record at the close of business on the        and         preceding the applicable interest
payment date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been
paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on overdue principal
and interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the overdue
principal or interest. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date. If the
Issuer delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is on or after the record date
and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but
excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the
Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable
procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose
Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Any Notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of the Relevant Clearing System will be
subject to the then applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable. Euroclear’s
and Clearstream’s current practice is to make payments in respect of global notes to participants of
record that hold an interest in the relevant global notes on the business day immediately preceding the
applicable interest payment date.


-----

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €300.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of Notes will be issued on the Issue Date. The Issuer may issue additional Notes (the
“Additional Notes”) from time to time under the Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants
contained in the Indenture. Any series of Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to
the Notes originally issued, except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in
an Officer’s Certificate (defined below) or, at the election of the Issuer, a supplemental indenture,
delivered to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent):

(1) whether such Additional Notes shall be issued as part of a new or existing series of Notes or
the title of such Additional Notes (which shall distinguish the Additional Notes of the series
from Notes of any other series);

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear
interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment
dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be
determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is
payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the
currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional
Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes;

(9) to reflect a change in tax law since the date of the Indenture in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”); and

(10) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Transaction Security
Documents.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of
the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series in such Officer’s Certificate or supplemental indenture (as applicable);
_provided that any Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of Notes offered_
hereunder for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall have a separate ISIN, Common Code or other
securities identification number from such Notes. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes
of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include
references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes.


-----

**Payments**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, with respect to
Notes represented by one or more global notes held by a common depositary of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of its nominee will be made through the Paying Agent (as
defined below) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
registered Holder or Holders thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear
and Clearstream).

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to certificated Notes
will be payable at the office or agency of one or more paying agents maintained for such purpose (the
“Paying Agent”) or, may, at the option of the Issuer, be made through the Paying Agent by check mailed
to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided
that all payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect
to certificated Notes may, at the option of the Issuer, be made by wire transfer to a euro account
maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe if the
applicable Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant
due date for payment (or such other date as the Paying Agent may accept in its discretion).

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of the Relevant Clearing System. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is
not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will
not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain a Paying Agent for the Notes and the initial Paying Agent will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC. The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent
(the “Transfer Agent”) for the Notes. The initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent will facilitate transfers of
the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. For so long as Notes are listed
on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and if and to the extent that
the rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so require, the Issuer
will notify the Authority of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes; _provided that it_
segregates and holds in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as Paying
Agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection
with a transfer or exchange of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to Holders, other than any taxes
payable in connection with such transfer or exchange. The Issuer and the Transfer Agent will not be
required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for
repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer (each as defined
herein). None of the Issuer, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will be required to transfer or exchange
any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed


-----

or between record date and payment date. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the absolute
owner of the Note for all purposes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, each Subsidiary of the Issuer will be a “Restricted Subsidiary” for the purposes of
the Indenture. However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate_
Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any
of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee, provide security with respect to, or
have their shares pledged in favor of, the Notes.

**Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and
severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by Villa Dutch Finco
B.V., a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid)
organized and existing under the laws of the Netherlands, having its registered office at Strawinskylaan
1209, WTC Tower A, 12[th] floor, 1077 XX Amsterdam, and its official seat in Amsterdam, and registered
with the Trade and Company Register (Kamer van Koophandel) under number 86918826 (the “Original
Guarantor”). Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material
limitations pursuant to applicable laws, on or prior to March 3, 2023, the Notes are expected to be
guaranteed on a senior basis by certain members of the House of HR Group that will guarantee the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Post-Closing Guarantors”). Such members of the
House of HR Group that are currently expected to grant such Note Guarantees are SOLCOM GmbH,
Accent Jobs For People NV, Accent Construct NV, House of HR NV, The House of Finance NV,
Continu B.V., Covebo Productie en Logistiek B.V., Covebo Techniek B.V., TimePartner
Personalmanagement GmbH, Talent & Pro Nederland B.V. and Wyzer B.V. In addition, if required by
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by
_Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to and in accordance with_
the Agreed Security Principles and subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws,
certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility will be guaranteed
on a senior basis, and the Second Lien Facility will be guaranteed on a subordinated basis, by each
Guarantor. French Bidco is also an obligor under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, but
will not provide a Note Guarantee or be an obligor under the Bridge Facility Agreement or the Second
Lien Facility Agreement. See “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.”

As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the expected Post-Closing Guarantors
represented 63.8% of Like-for-Like Revenues of the House of HR Group, 38.0% of the consolidated
assets (excluding intercompany eliminations) of the House of HR Group and 89.1% of Like-for-Like
EBITDA of the House of HR Group.

By its terms, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum
amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable
fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign
or state law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws and the Note
Guarantees of, or the relevant Note Documents to be entered into by, certain Guarantors organized in
certain jurisdictions, including, without limitation, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany will contain
language limiting the amount of indebtedness guaranteed or qualifying the Note Guarantee in order to
address applicable local law considerations (including preservation of share capital and statutory
reserves, capitalization, prohibited financial assistance, corporate benefit principles and other legal
restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders and directors or managers).
In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles


-----

as described below under “—Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting
of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement,
the Bridge Facility Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security
Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant
would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance
rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital
maintenance rules, liquidity impairment rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the
time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders.
By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly
less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation
under its Note Guarantee. However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws,_
_capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely_
_affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The insolvency laws of the Netherlands and other_
_applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or_
_those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests (as defined below), including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect_
_their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the_
liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests.”_

The Issuer is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital stock of its
Subsidiaries. As such, the Issuer will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments
to it to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes. A significant portion of the
operations of the Issuer will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become
Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted over
their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles or other limitations. Claims of creditors of
non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees
issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the
Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of
Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits
the incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (including Disqualified
Stock, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of
significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by
Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”_

**_Note Guarantee Releases_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon:

(1) a direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of
such Guarantor (as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted
Subsidiary), or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, to a Person other than the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and otherwise in compliance with the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;


-----

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
or upon the occurrence of any event after which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(3) payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes and the Indenture, as provided
in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, including in respect of the provisions relating to an IPO Debt Pushdown;

(5) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement; _provided that such Guarantor is not_
providing a Guarantee in respect of any other Credit Facility that replaces the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement at such time that will not also be released substantially
simultaneously with the release of the Note Guarantee and/or a Guarantee under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement;

(6) as described in the fifth paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;_

(7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or
another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with
the covenant under “—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Transaction;

(9) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that if a Reversion
Date (as defined herein) occurs, subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles, certain material limitations under applicable law and the Guarantee Limitations, the
Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to procure that any such Note Guarantee that
was released in reliance on this clause to be re-granted; and

(10) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

The Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture, take all
necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Issuer, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any
release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and/or the Security
Agent (as applicable) without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent
on the part of the Trustee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a
notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge. The Issuer may in its sole
discretion, and without prejudice to any future election in relation thereto, elect to have any Note
Guarantee remain in place, as opposed to being released.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on a firstpriority basis by (collectively, the “Issue Date Collateral”):

- a Dutch law governed limited recourse share pledge over the shares in the Issuer owned by the
Parent;


-----

- a Dutch law governed limited recourse security interest agreement over structural intercompany
receivables owed by the Issuer to the Parent;

- a Dutch law governed share pledge over the shares in the Original Guarantor owned by the
Issuer;

- a Dutch law governed security interest agreement over material, long term, documented,
structural intercompany receivables owed by the Original Guarantor to the Issuer;

- a Dutch law governed bank account pledge over the Issuer’s material bank accounts in the
Netherlands;

- a French law governed pledge over shares in French Bidco owned by the Issuer;

- a Belgian law governed share pledge over the shares in House of HR owned by the Issuer; and

- a Dutch law governed security interest agreement over structural intercompany receivables
owed by House of HR to the Original Guarantor.

In addition, on or prior to March 3, 2023, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain
material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof
will be secured by (collectively, the “Post-Closing Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date
Collateral, the “Collateral”):

- share pledges granted by wholly owned Material Subsidiaries incorporated in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction over the shares held in each Material Subsidiary incorporated in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction;

- in respect of a Post-Closing Guarantor (if any) incorporated in England and Wales, floating
security over substantially all assets located in its jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to
customary “excluded assets,” including real estate, and other customary exclusions, materiality
thresholds and exceptions); and

- in respect of a Post-Closing Guarantor (if any) incorporated in the United States, security over
substantially all assets located in its jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary
“excluded assets,” including real estate, and other customary exclusions, materiality thresholds
and exceptions),

in each case, where to do so would not have a material adverse effect on their ability to conduct their
business and operations, as determined by each such Post-Closing Guarantor in its sole and absolute
discretion. The Collateral and any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be
granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture in accordance
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement constitute “Charged Property.”

The Charged Property will also secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility on a
_pari passu basis and the Second Lien Facility on a second-ranking basis, and may also secure certain_
Hedging Obligations, any Additional Notes and certain other future Indebtedness. In addition, under
certain circumstances, including a repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under Facility B, any
Revolving Facility (including the Original Revolving Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(5)
of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” below, may be re-designated as a “super senior” obligation under the Intercreditor_
Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Charged Property after the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior Hedging
Obligations) have been paid in full. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”
and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”


-----

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the_
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Charged Property in
connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries,
including, subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Charged Property will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and holders of the
other secured obligations that are secured by the Charged Property pursuant to the Transaction Security
Documents. All Charged Property will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Note
Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any
Permitted Collateral Liens.

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property may not be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations owed to the Holders. No appraisals of the Charged Property have been made in connection
with the Offering. By its nature, some or all of the Charged Property will be illiquid and may have no
readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Charged Property may not be able to be sold in a
short period of time, or at all. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property may not be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes
_and Our Structure—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will_
_be granted as security for the Notes, future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that_
_do not secure the Notes and it may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral and the Collateral_
_may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

The Liens on the Charged Property will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising
under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Charged Property
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity impairment or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenants described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of_
_Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged or_
assigned, and any pledge or assignment over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens
not perfected), and certain guarantees may not be granted in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles or may be limited. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed
Security Principles, which include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust
and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled
foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital
maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims,
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of
a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or
security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited
accordingly; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or
security document shall be subject to such limit;


-----

- a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will
be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the
applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty,
registration costs and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal and notarial
fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other
financing arrangements, including any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted
under the Indenture) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured
parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents
if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal
capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or
statutory duties of their officers or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual
prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal
liability for any officer of or for any member of the Group; provided that, to the extent requested
by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession document,
the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any
such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration
and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be
agreed between the Issuer and the Security Agent;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of
granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security,
security will be granted over the material assets only;

- it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security
over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory
constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third
party arrangement (other than restrictions contained in the constitutional documents of a
member of the Group or in any intra-Group loan agreement), which may prevent or condition
the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document
(including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or
equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a
third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with
respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to
take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each
case will be excluded from a guarantee or security document;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of
the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability
of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary
course as otherwise permitted by the Finance Documents (as defined in the section entitled
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” above) (including
dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or
terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an
Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is continuing), and any
requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not
take any other action shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles;

- any security document will only be required to be notarized if required by law in order for the
relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence;


-----

- no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired person or asset
(and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to
support Acquired Indebtedness to the extent such Acquired Indebtedness is permitted by the
Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other
entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition permitted by the Indenture shall be required to
become a Guarantor or grant security with respect to the Notes if prevented by the terms of the
documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a
Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any
payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no security will be granted over any asset
secured for the benefit of any debt permitted by the Indenture and/or to the extent constituting
a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a Finance Document to the contrary;

- to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should be no action required
to be taken in relation to the guarantees or security when any Holder assigns or transfers any of
its Notes to a new holder (and, unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Indenture, no
member of the Group shall bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial, registration
or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment or transfer
by a Holder);

- no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be
required;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other
than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not
prohibit or prevent the creation of Transaction Security over such accounts) or any cash
constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from
any relevant security document);

- to the extent legally effective and permitted by applicable law, all security will be given in favor
of the Security Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to
hold one set of security documents for all secured parties) “parallel debt” provisions will be
used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual
security documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to
any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a secured party;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or
similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned
by another member of the Group;

- each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction permitted
under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security granted under each security
document shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after
the execution of the relevant security document and creation of the relevant security;

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

- the secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant
time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the
terms of the Finance Documents prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event which is
continuing;

- no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap
Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;


-----

- the agreement that the guarantees and security to be provided in respect of the Notes in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles are only to be given by wholly owned Material
Subsidiaries (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) incorporated in
Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United
States of America only (including any state thereof and the District of Columbia) (each, a
“Guarantor Jurisdiction”) and any other jurisdiction in which a borrower under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement is incorporated;

- other than a general filing relating to a floating charge or blanket lien, no perfection, filing or
other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the
Group or not in a Guarantor Jurisdiction or otherwise over the shares of a member of the Group
not located in a Guarantor Jurisdiction; and

- no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will
be required to be prepared or provided to the secured parties, unless (i) required for such
documents to become effective or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Acceleration Event is
continuing.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith
by the Issuer.

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with regard to the security interests in the Charged Property that are
created by the Transaction Security Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”)
as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, (b) the lenders under
the Bridge Facility Agreement, (c) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (d) the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Indenture, (e) the lenders under the Second Lien
Facility Agreement, and (f) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may
be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured by such Charged Property, respectively, will be
established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that
(i) the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement,
the Notes and certain Hedging Obligations and the guarantees thereof are secured equally and ratably
by first-priority Security Interests in the Charged Property and (ii) the obligations under the Second
Lien Facility Agreement are secured equally and ratably by second-priority Secured Interests in the
Charged Property. In addition, any Revolving Facility (including the Original Revolving Facility)
Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(5) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” below, may be re-designated as a “super senior”_
obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only
receive proceeds from the enforcement of, or certain distressed disposals of, the Charged Property after
the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior Hedging Obligations) have been paid in full. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted
_Collateral Liens.”_

**_Transaction Security Documents_**

Under the Transaction Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the
Charged Property to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment
obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Transaction Security
Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent for itself and
as agent (or as otherwise provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement) for the secured parties. When
entering into such Transaction Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but
for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time).
Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien


-----

Facility Agreement and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security
Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests and
local court decisions, the relevant Transaction Security Documents will secure “parallel debt”
obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully
tested under the law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
_Our Structure— The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather_
_than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may_
_be restricted by local law.”_

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Transaction Security Documents on
behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will
not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Charged Property securing the Notes, except
through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide
instructions to the Security Agent.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Transaction Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security
Interests in the Charged Property until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been
discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released
under certain circumstances as provided under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Transaction Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to
the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the
Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Transaction Security Documents. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The granting of the Note Guarantees and_
_security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in_
_the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance_
_with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the
Transaction Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law
Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the
Security Interests.” The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to
future Indebtedness that is secured on the Charged Property in compliance with the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement, the
Second Lien Facility Agreement and the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Charged
Property have appointed, and the Trustee will have and, by accepting a Note as described below, each
Holder will be deemed to have appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**


-----

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed (without any further
consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to enter into and give effect to the
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Transaction Security Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Transaction Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental
rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Transaction Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act in its name and on its behalf to
enter into and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Transaction Security Documents (including the execution of,
and compliance with, any waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed
to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf) and to be bound thereby and
to perform their respective obligations and exercise their respective rights thereunder in
accordance therewith.

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The security
_interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the_
_Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, release
of the Security Interests in respect of the Charged Property will be permitted under any one or more of
the following circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Issuer, in connection with any transfer, sale
or other disposition of Charged Property to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Merger and Consolidation”), if such
sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise permitted by the Indenture_
or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this sub-clause (b) shall not be relied upon in
the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan
receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization
Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets (to the extent already secured in favor of the
Notes) remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien (or substantially equivalent
Liens are granted) in favor of the Notes following such transfer, sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens”;_


-----

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and
assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets
designated by the Issuer as Receivables Assets in connection with a Receivables Facility;

(6) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Charged
Property, or the sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Charged Property,
in each case pursuant to a Qualified Securitization Financing;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Transaction; or

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Transaction Security Documents will be released (a)
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including
in respect of the provisions relating to an IPO Debt Pushdown and (b) as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee (if necessary or required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of Charged Property securing the
Notes and the Note Guarantees, including executing and delivering any appropriate document or
instrument evidencing such release (in the form provided by the Issuer), in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the relevant Transaction Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall occur
automatically or, if required to effect the release, be effected by the Security Agent without the consent
of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such
release). The Security Agent, only to the extent any action is necessary or required by it to effect the
release, and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of
the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On or following certain public equity offerings (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event
with respect to the release of Security Interests if required to implement such IPO Event), the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such
provisions) that the Issuer shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security
Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and the Transaction Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified
in such notice) as described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—
_Required Consents—Provisions Following an IPO” (an “IPO Debt Pushdown”). Following such notice,_
among other things, the Group would comprise of the member of the Group or holding company of the
Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO Event, subject to certain
limitations while the Notes are outstanding or in certain other circumstances (the “IPO Pushdown
Entity”) and its restricted subsidiaries and the Indenture will include provisions to provide for
substitution of the IPO Pushdown Entity as issuer to the extent permitted in accordance with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Any Parent Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
would not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the other Note Documents and any security
over its assets may be released or if a Guarantor, its Note Guarantee may be released, in each case, in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required,
at the expense of the Issuer, to enter into any amendment to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement


-----

(and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Transaction Security Documents (in the case of the
Security Agent) required by the Issuer, enter into any document or instrument in connection therewith
and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters
contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement; _provided that, and notwithstanding any contrary_
provision in the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Trustee, such amendment, replacement or
other document or instrument does not impose personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent, or affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunity of the Trustee or the Security
Agent under such amendment, release or replacement or other document or instrument.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the
Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time and from time to time prior to      , 2025, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes,
in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium with respect to the
Notes as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to     , 2025, the Issuer may, at its option, during each
calendar year redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional
Notes of the same series), upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption
price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to     , 2025, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem an
aggregate principal amount of Notes, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” not to
exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from one or more Equity Offerings or a
contribution to the Issuer’s common share capital made with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more
Equity Offerings, at a redemption price equal to       % of the principal amount of such Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date;
provided that:

(1) the aggregate principal amount redeemed shall not exceed 40% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes of the same
series);

(2) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the
Indenture on the Issue Date (excluding any Additional Notes of the same series) remains
outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption (unless all Notes are
redeemed substantially concurrently); and

(3) each such redemption occurs not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering.

At any time and from time to time on or after      , 2025, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem the
Notes in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption
price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date,
if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on       of the year indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2025 .................................................................................................................................................. %
2026 .................................................................................................................................................. %
2027, and thereafter ........................................................................................................................ 100.000%


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes
in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third
party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than
30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes of such series, in whole or in part, that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding
any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the
date of such redemption. Without prejudice to any provision of the Indenture regarding Notes deemed
to be not outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Issuer or its Affiliates, in determining whether
the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of a series
have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control
Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or
managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for
the purposes of such tender offer and such determination.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion
of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control, an
Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject
to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction.
If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such
notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion,
the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after
the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur
and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied
(or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption
or purchase date as so delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole
discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In
addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and
performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person.

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and,
subject to the requirements of the Relevant Clearing System, a single notice of redemption may be
delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may
provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have the same or different
redemption dates.

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request may be included
in an Officer’s Certificate), the Paying Agent will distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior
to the redemption date; provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least five Business
Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of
redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the
redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment,
break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on
the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such


-----

record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, and no
additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund; Transactions in the Notes**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to
purchase Notes as described under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders,_
including the Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from
time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes or derivative
instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or
otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our
indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the
incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The
amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.
Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt,
with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, the Relevant Clearing System,
as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such global Note from the
amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
global Note (or any portion thereof).

Under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants” accounts on
a pro rata basis (such as by way of a pool factor), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate and in accordance with their applicable procedures (unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange rules); provided that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal
amount may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, the Notes
will be selected on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized
denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; _provided, however, that no such partial_
redemption shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of any Notes below €100,000. None of the
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar shall be liable for selections made under
this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be
redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance
with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, except that redemption notices may be
delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued
in connection with a legal or covenant defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent
the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the


-----

Holders of the Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of
any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. When the Notes are held in certificated
form, a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. When the Notes are
held in the form of global notes, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note (or otherwise in
accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems) to decrease the principal
amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption
become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer
defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them
called for redemption.

Except as otherwise required under the Indenture, the Issuer may elect to redeem or repurchase one or
more series of Notes or a portion of a series of Notes without redeeming any other series of Notes.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at its discretion upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and Additional Amounts, as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes,” if any, then
due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise,
if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or
rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, introduction of or change in an official application, administration or
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by
reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”) is, or on the next interest payment date in
respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts (or increased Additional Amounts)
with respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without
the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable
measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying
Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and
become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions
shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one
payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such
successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of


-----

Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating
that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to
it (but in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made
by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts) and (b) a written opinion of tax counsel of recognized standing and satisfactory to the Trustee
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the effect that the Payor has
been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The
Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion
as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further
inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future
Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant
taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made
by any Payor or the Paying Agent or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof
or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for
tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause
(1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by any Payor or the Paying
Agent with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, such Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the
net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction
(including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the
amounts which would have been received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Note
or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of
any actual or deemed present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over
the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited
liability company or corporation) or the beneficial owner and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or
carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or having a place of
management present or deemed present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement
of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the


-----

Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days
before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of
the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any
other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to
the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder
would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day
of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with
respect to the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, capital gains, excise taxes imposed on transfer or
any Note, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections
1471 through 1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or
successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or
agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or similar law or regulation
implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;

(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet
_bronbelasting 2021) substantially in the form as at the Issue Date;_

(8) any Taxes imposed in Germany due to the recipient being resident for tax purposes in a noncooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) as set out in the German
Act Combating Tax Avoidance and Unfair Tax Competition and Amending Further Acts
(Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung
_weiterer Gesetze) and the respective legislative decree (Rechtsverordnung) as amended from_
time to time; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary
or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would
not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner
held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and to provide such
certified copies, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other reasonable
evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy
to the Paying Agent). If obtained, such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable
request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.


-----

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the
Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information
necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless
such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date,
in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date
that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such
reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related
interest or penalties with respect thereto) that are required to be paid in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
as a result of the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with
respect to any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto (in each case, other than in connection with a transfer after this offering) and limited, solely to
the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar
charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (9) (save that in
respect of clause (5), this limitation shall not apply in connection with transfer or similar Taxes).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which
any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under or with respect
to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party
makes a Change of Control Offer or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith
delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh
paragraph under this heading “—Change of Control,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of
the Notes (provided that Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole
and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or
after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose
name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the
repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will


-----

deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance
with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems or by first-class mail, with a copy to
the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or
otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems, describing
the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to
repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will
be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to
the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional
Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under
the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the
SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender
offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does
not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes
in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to
repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party
from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of
Control Triggering Event

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would entitle each lender under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien
Facility Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts
outstanding to it under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement
and the Second Lien Facility Agreement and could trigger a change of control under other financing
arrangements of the Group. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions
on certain events which would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require
the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of
Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds
may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control
Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of
Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and
us. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control
Triggering Event after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the
future.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of
Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our
ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and_ _“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such_
restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however,


-----

the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the
event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given
pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a
default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is
not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption
notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may
be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control
Triggering Event.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes
may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent
that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control
Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants
below under “—Certain Covenants.”

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) a series of Notes has achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

(the occurrence of such events, a “Covenant Suspension Event” and the date thereof being referred to
as the “Suspension Date”), then, beginning on the Suspension Date until the occurrence of the Reversion
Date, (i) the amount of each basket set by reference to a monetary amount for which a specific amount
is set out in the Indenture and any definitions used therein (including all “annual,” “life of notes,” “fiscal
year,” “financial year,” “calendar year,” “at any time” and “aggregate” baskets) shall be increased by
50% and (ii) the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Offering
Memorandum will no longer be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

- “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;


-----

- “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

- “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

- “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

- the provisions of clauses (ii)(y) and (iv) under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”;

- “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

- “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

- “—Impairment of Security Interest.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Issuer may not designate any
of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant
protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent
date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency
withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the relevant series of Notes
below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by
such Rating Agency), then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to
the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between
the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.”
The Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the
occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset
Dispositions shall be reset to zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens
to the extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted
Liens) and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be
interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the
Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the definitions
of “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens” and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a
Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to
exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply
with any of the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided that (1) with respect to
Restricted Payments (as defined herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made
as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period_
(including with respect to an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period); (2) all
Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued
in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be
classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”; (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such_
reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to
be permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”; (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted_
Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i)
of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions


-----

_from Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the_
covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”
after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary
during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed
made in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be
classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes
or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension
Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any
Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during
the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on
any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period) and (2) following a Reversion
Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event
of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations
arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that any series of Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Rating. The Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event and a Reversion Date; provided
that no such notification shall be a condition for the Covenant Suspension Event to be effective. The
Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the ratings of the Notes (or deemed to have knowledge of the
ratings of the Notes, or of the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event or a Reversion Date, unless
so notified in accordance with this paragraph), (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or
Reversion Date have occurred or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

and type of such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph of
this covenant or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant,

deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes
of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first
Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(iv) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding
amount of such Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts

for all purposes under the Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating
any Applicable Metric for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and
including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) may be determined, at the Issuer’s option (A) on the date of such
revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or (B)
on the date on which such facility or commitments become available or, if
applicable, any other Applicable Test Date (assuming, in the case of (A) and
(B) of this clause (viii) that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the
Issuer, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) and, in either case,
if any such Applicable Metric is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this

covenant irrespective of the Applicable Metric at the time of any borrowing or
reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances

on such date shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for
purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of any clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding under such clauses);

(ix) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance
on the first paragraph of this covenant or any clause of the second paragraph
of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA as of
the Applicable Test Date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of
LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage
of LTM EBITDA on the Applicable Test Date of such refinancing, such
percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so
long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate
amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including
original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium
and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing; and

(x) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a
price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount
of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or
Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not previously treated as
Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for
purposes of the covenant described under this covenant; provided that the amount of any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) be
increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue
discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such Increased Amount
will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold
under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Issuer shall be in
default of this covenant).

For the purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness
denominated in a given currency, the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock)
denominated in another currency shall be calculated as described under “—Financial and Other
_Calculations”; provided that if such determination is made with respect to Indebtedness Incurred to_
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in another currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable currency-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency


-----

exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such currency denominated restriction, as
applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount (or liquidation
preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does
not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness (or liquidation preference in the case of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of accrued and
unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar
fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs
and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

Subordinated Liabilities, save to the extent otherwise agreed by the
Agent.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and without prejudice to the section “—
_Financial and Other Calculations,” in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) (i) meets_
the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in the second paragraph
of this covenant, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or (iii)
constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances
existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof)
in any manner that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the Applicable
Test Date of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value
of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash
Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer
acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or
otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the Issuer’s
Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity
and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct
or indirect” action by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.


-----

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), and the Parent will not, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon the Charged Property owned by it, in each case, whether owned on the Issue
Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien
is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except:

(i) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Charged Property:

(A) Permitted Liens; or

(B) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations
under the Notes and the Indenture are directly secured equally and
ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial
Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured; and

(ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Charged Property, Permitted
Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (i)(B) of the first paragraph of this
covenant will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Transaction Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase
in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(i) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives
consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other person
assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least
equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the
date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in
good faith by the Issuer, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset
Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is
a Permitted Asset Swap);

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions, with a
purchase price in excess of the greater of (x) €52.0 million and (y) an amount
equal to 15% of LTM EBITDA, except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap,
at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Disposition, together with all
other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received


-----

by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form
of Cash Equivalent Investments; and provided that the amount of:

(A) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any
liabilities (as reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s
most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto or,
if Incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet,
such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s or such
Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes
thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the
date of such balance sheet, as determined by the Issuer) of the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their
terms subordinated to the Notes, that are (1) assumed by the transferee
of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer)
pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities or (2)
otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are
converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer acting in good faith to
be converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash
Equivalent Investments (to the extent of the Cash Equivalent
Investments received or expected to be received) or by their terms are
required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalent Investments within 180
days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; and

(C) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Disposition having an
aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (C) that is at
that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) €86.5 million
and (y) an amount equal to 25% of LTM EBITDA at the time of the
receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (or, at the Issuer’s
option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition),
with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value, shall each be deemed to be Cash
Equivalent Investments for purposes of this provision and for no other
purpose; and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset
Disposition is applied, to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be, elects (at its sole discretion):

(A) to prepay, repay or purchase:

(1) any Senior Secured Indebtedness; and/or

(2) any other Permitted Debt (provided that such application
would comply with the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments”),_

(in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary);


-----

(B) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by
means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the
Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) or make a capital expenditure;
and/or

(C) to make any Restricted Payment or Permitted Payment permitted to be
made under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” or any Permitted Investment,_

in each case, within 365 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that:

(1) in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of
Indebtedness pursuant to sub-clause (iii)(A) above, the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and
will cause the related commitment (if any) (other than in the
case of any asset-based credit facility or any revolving credit
facility (including a Revolving Facility)) to be reduced in an
amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or
purchased;

(2) a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later
than such 365th day shall be treated as a permitted application
of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment
or letter of intent so long as the Issuer, or such Restricted
Subsidiary, enters into such commitment or letter of intent
with the good faith expectation that such Net Available Cash
will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent
within the later of such 365th day and 180 days of such
commitment or letter of intent (an “Acceptable Commitment”)
or, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled
or terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash is
applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a
“Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation
or termination; _provided, further, that if any Second_
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason
before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net
Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds; and

(3) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net
Available Cash in accordance with sub-clauses (iii)(A) to
(iii)(C) above or otherwise in accordance with this covenant,
the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily
reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash
in any manner permitted by the Indenture.

The following amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed
to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture:

(i) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in
respect of the relevant Asset Disposition exceeds 4.33:1.00 on a pro forma
basis, 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or


-----

(ii) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in
respect of the relevant Asset Disposition exceeds 4.08:1.00 but does not exceed
4.33:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 50% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset
Disposition; or

(iii) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in
respect of the relevant Asset Disposition does not exceed 4.08:1.00 on a pro
forma basis, 0% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition;
_provided that:_

(A) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to
prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Notes or other Senior
Secured Indebtedness (other than the Notes) at a price of no less than
100% of the principal amount thereof, and has extended such offer to
the Holders of the Notes on at least a pro rata basis (or, in the case of
global Notes, in accordance with the procedures of the Relevant
Clearing System) to the extent the creditors in respect of such Senior
Secured Indebtedness (including the Holders) elect not to tender their
Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or
purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net
Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this clause
(A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds
(such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the
fourth paragraph of this covenant, the “Declined Proceeds”); and

(B) for the avoidance of doubt, Net Available Cash that will not constitute
Excess Proceeds pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph above
shall be immediately available to the Group for any purposes permitted
by the Indenture, including to make Restricted Payments in accordance
with clause (xxiv) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” without regard to the
periods specified in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

On the 366th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later
of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds under this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) €86.5 million and (y) an amount equal to 25%
of LTM EBITDA in a single transaction, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days make an offer (an
“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any
other Senior Secured Indebtedness, to the holders or lenders of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, to
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and
such Senior Secured Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price
in cash in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal amount thereof (or
accreted value, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such
offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and (ii) in the case of such other
Senior Secured Indebtedness, the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such Senior Secured Indebtedness.

The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset
Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the
expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided above) (the “Asset Disposition Offer
Period”) with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of
being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes tendered and other Senior
Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount
offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the


-----

Issuer shall prepay, repay or purchase the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may
be, on a pro rata basis (or otherwise in accordance with the Relevant Clearing System) based on the
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Senior Secured
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Senior
Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination.
Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess
Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero
(regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon
consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall
not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose
permitted under the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Senior Secured
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the
amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance
Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the
Advance Portion) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or
all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable
local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory
duties of the relevant directors or managers) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash
of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent
necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as
determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will
not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited
with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note
Guarantees (but the Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery
of such consents).

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance
Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not
be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may
rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend
enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro,
such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent
amount determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or
other agreements to which the Issuer or another member of the Group becomes a party may prohibit or
limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is
prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of the lenders under such
agreements to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such


-----

prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain
prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes
could constitute an Event of Default (subject to the relevant grace periods and other provisions described
under “—Events of Default” below) under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series
of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the
greater of (x) €35.0 million and (y) an amount equal to 10% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than
those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such
transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in
arm’s length dealings with a person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess
of the greater of (x) €52.0 million and (y) an amount equal to 15% of LTM
EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer; provided that
any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have satisfied the
requirements set forth in this clause (ii) if such Affiliate Transaction is
approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(i) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or any Permitted
Investment;

(ii) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or
other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or
otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of,
any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase
Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity,
restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights
plans, participation plans, transaction bonuses or transaction-related securities
repurchase plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including
valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement,
savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided
on behalf of officers, employees, directors, managers or consultants approved
by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of
business;

(iii) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(iv) any:

(A) transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary
(or entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries; and


-----

(B) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity;
_provided that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and_
no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalent Investments and
the Capital Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or
consolidation is otherwise permitted under the Indenture;

(v) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and
customary indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and
employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors,
managers, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the
Issuer, any Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or
indirectly and including through any Controlled Investment Affiliate of such
directors, managers, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or
employees);

(vi) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and
any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or
instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this
covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a
whole) in any material respect;

(vii) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing or
Receivables Facility, any disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets,
Receivables Assets or related assets in connection with any Qualified
Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility;

(viii) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers,
contractors, distributors or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each
case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could
reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(ix) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or
similar entity which would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely:

(A) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted
Holder owns an equity interest in, or otherwise controls such Affiliate,
Associate or similar entity; or

(B) due to the fact that a director or manager of such person is also a
director or manager of the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent Entity
of the Issuer (provided that such director abstains from voting as a
director of the Issuer or such direct or indirect Parent Entity of the
Issuer, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other person);

(x) any:

(A) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or
Designated Preferred Stock) of the Issuer or options, warrants or other
rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder

therewith or any contribution to capital of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(B) amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any
Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other

modified, will continue to satisfy the requirements described in the
definition of Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

(xi) any:

(A) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted
Holder (whether directly or indirectly), including to its affiliates or its

connection therewith and any termination fees (including any such

acquisitions or divestitures; and

(C) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted
Holder (whether directly or indirectly), including to its affiliates or its

this Offering Memorandum, which are, in the case of each of subclauses (A) and (B) only, approved by a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(xii) payment to any Permitted Holder of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
such Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in
the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;

(xiii) the Transactions and the payment of all costs and expenses (including all legal,
accounting and other professional fees and expenses) related to the
Transactions;

(xiv) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor
stating that either (x) such transaction is fair to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (y) that such transaction meets the
requirements of clause (i) of the first paragraph of this covenant;

(xv) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
of its obligations under the terms of, any equity holders agreement (including

enter into thereafter; provided that the existence of, or the performance by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future
amendment to the equity holders” agreement or under any similar agreement
entered into after the Issue Date will only be permitted under this clause to the
extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not
otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material
respect as determined in good faith by the Issuer;

(xvi) any purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock
of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which
Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is purchased by persons who are not the

Affiliates;

(xvii) any:

related to a Permitted Change of Control, the payment of Permitted Change of
Control Costs and the issuance of Capital Stock to the management of the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with a Permitted
Change of Control; and

(xxx) the execution, delivery and, without duplication, performance of any Tax
Sharing Agreement or any arrangement pursuant to which the Issuer or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax
return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax,
accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of
business.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(i) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its
Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(iii) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving
dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating
distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances
made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred
by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute
such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Bridge Facility and the Second Lien
Facility) and any security documents related thereto, (b) the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on, or prior
to, the Issue Date;

Person or relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered
into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by or merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of
the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or
was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined
with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in
contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on
such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is
the Successor Company (as defined below), any Subsidiary thereof or
agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be
deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when
such Person becomes the Successor Company;


-----

(v) any encumbrance, restriction or condition: (A) that restricts in a customary
manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is
subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment
or transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement; (B) contained
in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions
restrict the transfer or encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; (C) contained in any
trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or
other agreement to which the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a
party entered into in the ordinary course of business; _provided that such_
agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the
payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend
to any other asset or property of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or the
assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or (D) pursuant to
customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth
in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(vi) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and
Lease Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose
encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired;

(vii) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into
for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially
all the Capital Stock or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the
property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

(viii) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture
agreements and other similar agreements, organizational documents and
instruments;

(ix) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of or pursuant to
applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation, licensing requirement or
order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental license,
concessions, franchises or permits, including restrictions on encumbrances on
cash or deposits (including assets in escrow accounts) paid on property;

(x) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed
by customers or suppliers, or as required by insurance, surety or bonding
companies or indemnities, in each case, under agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business;

(xi) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(xii) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing
or Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, are
necessary or advisable to effect such Securitization Facility or Receivables
Facility;

(xiii) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument
(a) relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the
Issue Date pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on


-----

_Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such_
agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to
the Holders (taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in (A) the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge
Facility Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement or the Indenture,
together with the Transaction Security Documents associated therewith, and
(B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or
(ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by
the Issuer) and where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), either (x) the Issuer
determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such
encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect,
the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (y)
such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a
default relating to such agreement or instrument, or (b) constituting an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(xiv) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”; or

(xv) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument
effecting a refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise
refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in clauses (i) to (xiv) of this
paragraph or this clause (xv) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clauses (i) to (xiv) of this paragraph or this clause (xv); provided, however, that
the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which
such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an
Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted
Payments pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under
one or more clauses of the definition of “Permitted Payments” or “Permitted Investments,” as
determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted
at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
The Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that
redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee on the date of such designation by delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying
that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted_
Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will
only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” (including pursuant to clause (v) of the second paragraph thereof treating_


-----

such redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as
at the Applicable Test Date; and (2) no Event of Default would be in existence immediately following
such designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer
shall be evidenced to the Trustee by delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that
such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports
following the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day)
after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer (or, in the case of the first fiscal year ending after
the Issue Date, 150 days), annual reports containing: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet
of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years,
including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal
years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating
and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in
liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (iii) unaudited pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations (other than the Transactions) that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report
relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to
clauses (2) or (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant); provided that such pro forma financial
information will be provided only to the extent reasonably available and without unreasonable
expense; (iv) a brief description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer,
all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material debt instruments and (v) a
summary description of any changes to risk factors that would be material and material recent
developments; provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be provided
in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day)
after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer (or, in the
case of the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023, 90 days), commencing with the fiscal quarter
ended March 31, 2023, quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (i)
the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flow for the most recent
quarter year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the
comparable prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma
income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations (other than the
Transactions) that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year
as to which such quarterly report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided
in a previous report pursuant to this clause (2) or clause (3) of the first paragraph of this
covenant); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the
extent reasonably available and without unreasonable expense; (iii) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital
resources of the Issuer and (iv) material recent developments; provided that the information
described in clause (iv) may be provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements;
and


-----

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer
of the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such
event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act
for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not
“affiliates” under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under
any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) shall
be on a basis consistent with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or
otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented,
except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth
in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries
of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to
U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity
or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s pro forma consolidated
revenue or LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial
reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary
of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements
or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports
which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long
as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section
13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English translation.

Subject to compliance with the next subsequent paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the
equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock
Exchange) and the Issuer or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure
standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London
Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading
on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock


-----

Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects,
the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other
reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange (or one or more
of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) pursuant to such admission and
disclosure standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New
York Stock Exchange, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided
that such requirements require the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual
reports, information, documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange,
or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock
Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer
will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this covenant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or
financial statements under this covenant by providing (x) any report or financial statements of (i) any
IPO Entity or (ii) any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer so long as such reports (if an annual
or quarterly report) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant
as if references to the Issuer therein were references to the IPO Entity or such Parent Entity; or (y) any
report or financial statements of (i) House of HR or (ii) a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Issuer that
represents substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (any entity under subclause (y), a “Reporting Subsidiary” and together with the Issuer or any entity under sub-clause (x), a
“Financial Reporting Entity” (as determined at the sole discretion of the Issuer)) so long as such reports
(if an annual or quarterly report) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery)
of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were references to the Reporting Subsidiary. Upon
complying with the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in this covenant.

For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made under the Indenture, the
Issuer may use financial statements of any Financing Reporting Entity (or a predecessor thereof) for
reporting or making calculations under the Indenture.

Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under this section is for informational
purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of the foregoing will not constitute actual or constructive notice
of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the
Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture (as to which the Trustee is entitled to
rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates or Opinions of Counsel, as applicable).

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or
knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the
Security Interest with respect to the Charged Property (it being understood that (i) the Incurrence of
Permitted Collateral Liens or the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the
Charged Property, (ii) the occurrence of or implementation or any step in the Transactions or any
Permitted Transaction and (iii) the implementation of an IPO Pushdown shall under no circumstances
be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Charged Property) for the benefit
of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Parent and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Transaction Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest in any of the
Charged Property that is prohibited by the covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
_or “—Limitation on Liens”; provided that the Parent, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may_
Incur any Lien over any of the Charged Property that is permitted by the covenants described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the_


-----

Charged Property may be discharged, transferred or released in any circumstances permitted by the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the
discharge, transfer or release of any Charged Property or Lien in any circumstance in accordance with
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or the
Transaction Security Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the Transaction Security Documents may
be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (1)
to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (2) for the purposes of Incurring
Permitted Collateral Liens; (3) to add to the Charged Property; (4) for the purposes of undertaking any
Permitted Transaction, a Permitted Tax Restructuring, an IPO Pushdown, the Transactions and/or a
transaction permitted by the covenants described under “—Merger and Consolidation,” (5) to make
any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; or (6) to
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or release any Transaction
Security Documents followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over
the same assets; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (5) and (6) above, no Transaction Security
Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise
modified or released unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement
supplement, replacement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee,
either (i) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and
the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international
standing which confirms the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), (ii) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors
of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Lien after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets) or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary
for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a
Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Transaction
Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced, modified or
released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same
assets) are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new
hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately
prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or
release and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and
customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such actions without the need for instructions
from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and the Guarantee Limitations, the
Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, other than a Guarantor or a Securitization Subsidiary,
to Guarantee the payment of (i) any syndicated Credit Facility or (ii) Public Debt of the Issuer or any
Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of the greater of (x) €86.5 million and (y) 25% of
LTM EBITDA at such time, unless:


-----

(i) such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor within 60 days after the
guarantee of such Indebtedness; and

(ii) if applicable, executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture
providing for a Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, which will be
senior to or _pari passu with, as applicable, such Restricted Subsidiary’s_
Guarantee of such other Indebtedness, except that with respect to a guarantee
of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its
express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such
Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such Guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of
payment to such Note Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such
Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall be obligated to
become a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is contrary
to the Agreed Security Principles or the Guarantee Limitations or could give rise to or result in:

(i) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial
assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance
rules, liquidity impairment rules, guidance and coordination rules, retention of
title claims or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any
applicable jurisdiction;

(ii) any risk or liability for the officers, directors, managers or (except in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership,
directors, managers or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or

(iii) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes)
other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.

At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the
extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including
the Guarantee Limitations and those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance, liquidity impairment or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law (including any usury laws).

The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be
a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with
the 60-day period described in this covenant. The Indenture will provide that this covenant shall not be
applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Note
_Guarantees—Note Guarantee Releases.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released_
at the option of the Issuer if, at the date of such release, there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a
Guarantor as at that date. The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security
Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Corporate benefit, financial assistance
_laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may_
_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Certain_


-----

_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of: (i) any Indebtedness secured on Charged Property or as
otherwise required or not prohibited herein; and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of
Indebtedness referred to in sub-clause (i) above, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly
authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees
and priority and release of the Security Interests, provided that: (A) such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the
reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if more than one such
intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements
must not conflict.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement
or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking
junior in right of payment to the Notes and the Note Guarantees); (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) further secure the Notes
(including Additional Notes); (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Charged Property
to secure Additional Notes; (vi) to facilitate a Permitted Tax Restructuring, a Permitted Reorganization
or the Transactions; (vii) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (viii) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; or (ix)
make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a
whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to ensure that the Notes and the Note
Guarantees are secured by first-ranking Liens over the Charged Property.

The Indenture will also provide that the Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security
Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, other than: (i) in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant; (ii) with the
consent of the requisite majority of Holders except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments
_and Waivers” or (iii) as otherwise permitted by such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor_
Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely affect
their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
requisite majority of Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby, _provided that such_
transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”


-----

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial and Other Calculations_**

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding for the avoidance of doubt Excess Cash Flow) in the Note Documents, including
when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period
(including the portion thereof occurring prior to any relevant Purchase (as defined below)), the Issuer
may: (a) if during such period any member of the Group (by merger or otherwise) has made or
committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to make an Investment in any person that thereby
becomes (or that the Issuer expects in good faith, based upon such commitment, will become) a
Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise has acquired or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise)
to acquire any entity, business, property or material fixed asset (including the acquisition, opening
and/or development of any new site or operation) (any such Investment, acquisition or commitment
(including under a letter of intent) therefor, a “Purchase”), including any such Purchase occurring in
connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made under the Indenture or the other Finance
Documents, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that the earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA,
mutatis mutandis) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Purchase during such Relevant
Period shall be included as if the Purchase occurred on the first day of such Relevant Period; and/or (b)
include an adjustment in respect of any Purchase and/or any steps taken or committed to be taken (in
each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) in respect of such Purchase up to the amount of the
pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking into
account the full “run rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) determines have
been or will be achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such Relevant Period directly or indirectly
as a consequence of the Purchase or any related steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually
realized during the Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; _provided that so_
long as such Synergies have been or will be realized at any time during such Relevant Period, it may be
assumed they were realized during the entirety of such Relevant Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which
the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be achieved following the end of such period directly or indirectly
as a consequence of the Purchase or any related steps (the “Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies”);
_provided, further, that so long as such Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies will be realizable at any_
time in the future, it may be assumed they will be realizable during the entire period; in each case,
without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant Period and already included in
Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (c) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or
indirectly related to the Purchase.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding for the avoidance of doubt Excess Cash Flow) in the Note Documents, including
when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period
(including the portion thereof occurring prior to any relevant Sale (as defined below)), the Issuer may:
(a) if during such period any member of the Group has disposed or committed (unilaterally,
conditionally or otherwise) to make a disposal of any person, property, business or material fixed asset
or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business sold, transferred or otherwise disposed
of by the Group (any such sale, transfer, disposition or commitment therefor, a “Sale”) or if the
transaction giving rise to the need to calculate Consolidated EBITDA relates to such a Sale, calculate
Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA will be reduced by an
amount equal to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment (calculated
on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if positive) attributable to the assets
which are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount equal to the earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment (calculated on the same basis as


-----

Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if negative) attributable thereto for such period as if the Sale
occurred on the first day of such Relevant Period; and/or (b) include an adjustment in respect of any
Sale and/or any steps taken or committed to be taken (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or
otherwise) in respect of such Sale up to the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA
projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking into account the full “run rate” effect of: (i) all
Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) determines have been or will be achieved (in full or in part)
at any time during such Relevant Period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Sale or any related
steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant Period and already
included in Consolidated EBITDA; _provided that so long as such Synergies have been realized at any_
time during such Relevant Period, it may be assumed they were realized during the entirety of such
Relevant Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be achieved
following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Sale or any related steps
(the “Forward-Looking Sale Synergies”); provided, further, that so long as such Forward-Looking Sale
Synergies will be realizable at any time in the future, it may be assumed they will be realizable during
the entire period; in each case, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant
Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (c) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs
and expenses directly or indirectly related to the Sale.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding for the avoidance of doubt Excess Cash Flow) in the Note Documents, including
when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period
(including the portion thereof occurring prior to implementing or committing to implement such Group
Initiative), the Issuer may: (a) include an adjustment in respect of each Group Initiative and/or any steps
taken or committed to be taken (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) in respect of such
Group Initiative up to the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the
Issuer (in good faith) after taking into account the full “run rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which the
Issuer (in good faith) determines have been or will be achieved (in full or in part) at any time during
such Relevant Period directly or indirectly as a consequence of implementing or committing to
implement such Group Initiative or any related steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually
realized during the Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; _provided that so_
long as such Synergies have been realized at any time during such Relevant Period, it may be assumed
they were realized during the entirety of such Relevant Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer
(in good faith) believes can be achieved following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a
consequence of implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative or any related steps
(the “Forward-Looking Group Initiative Synergies” and together with the Forward-Looking Purchase
Synergies and the Forward-Looking Sale Synergies, the “Forward-Looking Synergies”); provided,
_further, that so long as such Forward-Looking Group Initiative Synergies will be realizable at any time_
in the future, it may be assumed they will be realizable during the entire period; in each case, without
prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant Period and already included in
Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (b) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or
indirectly related to the implementation of, or commitment to, implement such Group Initiative.

In relation to the definitions set out in the Indenture and all other related provisions of the Note
Documents (including any Applicable Metric): (i) all calculations will be as determined in good faith
by an Officer of the Issuer (including in respect of Synergies); and (ii) all calculations in respect of
Synergies (in each case actual or anticipated) may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such
Synergies were realized on the first day of the Relevant Period.

Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income for any part of a Relevant Period falling prior to
the Issue Date shall be calculated on an actual basis over the Relevant Period (whereby for any part of
the applicable Relevant Period falling prior to the date on which the House of HR Group became part
of the Group, such amount shall be calculated based on actual historic data for the corresponding period
available and by reference to the House of HR Group as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of
this paragraph and the other provisions of the Indenture) or, at the Issuer’s option, on the basis of the
final management case financial model.


-----

Unless a contrary indication appears, a reference in the Note Documents to Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, LTM EBITDA, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is to be construed as
a reference to Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, LTM EBITDA, the Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio of the Group on a consolidated basis.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in the
Indenture), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof but
excluding Excess Cash Flow, the Issuer shall be permitted to: (a) exclude all or any part of any
expenditure or other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or
resulting from: (i) the Transactions; (ii) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture
permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting; (iii) start-up costs
for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing businesses; (iv) Restructuring Costs; (v)
research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof); and/or (vi) the implementation
of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases) and, in each case, any
successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under the accounting principles) or any other
changes in the applicable accounting principles; and/or (b) include any addbacks (without further
verification or diligence) for adjustments (including anticipated Synergies) or costs or expenses of a
type included in “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” in this Offering Memorandum or otherwise related to
the Transactions and/or any base case model or quality of earnings report relating to a Permitted
Acquisition prepared by an independent third party and and/or taken into account in determining “Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA” or any financing EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for a
Permitted Acquisition and/or any research and development expenditure (which is not otherwise
capitalized).

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in
connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall,
at the option of the Issuer, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any Applicable
Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable
Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro
forma calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any
Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph,
such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes;
_provided that (a) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the_
basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter
be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b)
save as contemplated in clause (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be
determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any
actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been
complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric),
such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with
as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or
Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable
Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied
(including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements
and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default
or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).


-----

Subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action_
or transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and
prior to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer
determines (in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such
Applicable Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction.

If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed,
incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any
Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net
Leverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without
regard to the Incurrence or drawing of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit
facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under
any Revolving Facility or any ancillary facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement)
and, for the avoidance of doubt, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a
Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

If, in connection with the same Applicable Transaction or otherwise substantially simultaneously: (a)(i)
any Applicable Metrics required to be determined by reference to a fixed currency amount or a
percentage of LTM EBITDA (a “fixed permission”) are intended to be utilized; and/or (ii) revolving
Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness under the Reserved Indebtedness Amount) is intended to be
Incurred; and (b) any Applicable Metric required to be determined by reference to the Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric (a “ratio-based permission”) are
intended to be utilized (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination of any increase or
decrease in any such Applicable Metric, including in accordance with the clauses (v)(B)(1), (v)(B)(2)
or (v)(B)(3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
then (x) amounts available to be incurred under the applicable ratio-based permissions shall first be
calculated without giving effect to amounts to be incurred under the applicable fixed permissions or the
applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness, or amounts previously incurred under such fixed
permissions and not reclassified that are being repaid in connection with such Applicable Transaction,
unless otherwise elected by the Issuer; and (y) thereafter, compliance with any relevant fixed
permissions shall be calculated, and in each case, full pro forma effect shall be given to all increases to
LTM EBITDA and repayments or discharges of Indebtedness in connection with such Applicable
Transaction in accordance with the Indenture.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical
permission”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower permission
of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of a
Permitted Acquisition or Permitted Investment, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be
increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any
such Permitted Acquisitions and/or Permitted Investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a
result of any decrease in the grower permission.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one Applicable Metric, the
Issuer may (in its sole discretion), subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” classify and reclassify that
amount or transaction to a particular Applicable Metric and will only be required to include that amount
or transaction in one of those Applicable Metrics (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount may at
the option of the Issuer be split between different Applicable Metrics).

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion
thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently


-----

be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter,
transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based
permission.

The Indenture will provide that references to (i) any matter being “permitted” by or under the Indenture
(or any covenant or section thereof) or any other Note Document shall include references to such matters
not being prohibited or otherwise being approved under the Indenture or such other Note Document
and (ii) any transaction being in the “ordinary course of business” of a member of the Group shall be
construed to include any transaction that is consistent with industry practice in the industries in which
the Group operates or consistent with past practice of any member of the Group or the House of HR
Group.

For purposes of determining compliance with: (i) any euro-denominated Applicable Metric (other than
in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Note Documents or related
usage, ratchet or permission), the euro equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall
be calculated using a rate of exchange selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on
the Applicable Test Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange
hedging entered into by the Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction); or (ii) any other Applicable
Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Note
Documents), the euro equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, at
the Issuer’s option, using any of: (A) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates over the
relevant testing period; (B) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial statements or
management accounts; (C) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and
in good faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Test Date, if applicable);
or (D) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging arrangement entered into by
any member of the Group, and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or any breach of
representation or warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the
euro equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Period,
a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual
_Period”):_

(i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such
Applicable Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an
amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted
amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof
actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period
(the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the
permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the
permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be
reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable
Metric during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i)
above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period shall
be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry
Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted
during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i)
above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

For the purpose of this section and to the extent any Applicable Metric is used as the basis (in whole or
in part) for permitting any transaction or making any determination under the Indenture (including on
a pro forma basis), no item shall be included or excluded more than once where to do so would result
in double counting.


-----

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

Subject to the first and fourth paragraphs under “—General” below, the Issuer will not consolidate with
or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any person, unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the “Successor Company”) will
be a person organized and existing under the laws of the United Kingdom, the
United States (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any state or territory
thereof, including the District of Columbia), Canada (including any province
thereof), Switzerland, any Member State of the European Union, and the
Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, by way of
supplemental indenture or other document or instrument, executed and
delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture,
the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents and any other Note
Documents, as applicable;

(ii) (x) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any
Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the applicable Successor Company
or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company or
such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, and (y)(A) immediately after giving effect to such
transaction, the Issuer or the Successor Company would be able to Incur at
least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; or (B) immediately
after giving effect to such transaction, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would
not be lower, or the Total Net Leverage Ratio would not be higher, than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(iii) the Issuer or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered
to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture
comply with the Indenture; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact; and

(iv) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the
same or substantially equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such
equivalency any limitations required in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles or hardening periods (or any similar or equivalent concept))
guarantees and security over the same or substantially equivalent assets and
over the shares (or other interests) in the Issuer or the Successor Company,
save to the extent such assets or shares (or other interests) cease to exist
(provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Issuer cease to exist,
security will be granted (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the
shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture.

_Guarantors_


-----

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(i) consolidate (for the avoidance of doubt, not including any fiscal unity for
corporate income tax or value added tax purposes) with or merge with or into
any person;

(ii) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all its
assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any person; or

(iii) permit any person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless:

(A) the other person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor (or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with the
transaction); or

(B) either (x) the Issuer or a Guarantor is the continuing person or (y) the
resulting, surviving or transferee person expressly assumes all of the
obligations of the Guarantor under the Indenture and all obligations of
the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents, as
applicable, and immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no
Event of Default is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way
of consolidation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition
of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other
than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by
the Indenture.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):

(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from
consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its
properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor;

(iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if
the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation:

(A) the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer (as
applicable) under the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Transaction Security Documents and with respect to the Issuer,
clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of the covenant described under “—The
_Issuer” above shall apply to such transaction; and_

(B) to the extent that any Transaction Security previously granted over the
shares in the capital of the relevant Guarantor would not, in accordance
with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in the capital of
the surviving entity, the direct Parent Holding Company of the
surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, grant


-----

Transaction Security over the shares in the capital of the surviving
entity on substantially equivalent terms to any Security Interests
granted over the shares in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation;

(iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with
an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or
changing the legal form of such entity; _provided that, in the case of a_
consolidation, merger or combination of:

(A) the Issuer into or with an Affiliate that is not a Guarantor, clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the covenant described under “—The Issuer” shall
apply to such transaction; and

(B) any Guarantor into or with an Affiliate, sub-clause (iii) above shall
apply to such transaction; or

(v) the Transactions or any Permitted Transaction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

This covenant shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, this covenant will not prohibit or restrict the
Transactions or any Permitted Transaction, in each case, which shall be expressly permitted under this
covenant.

**Events of Default**

Subject to the two succeeding paragraphs, each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the
Indenture:

(a) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30
days;

(b) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note when
due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise, continued for five Business Days;

(c) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor, or, solely in connection with its obligations
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain
_Covenants— Impairment of Security Interest,” the Parent to comply for 60 days after_
written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30%
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any agreement or
obligation contained in the Indenture;

(d) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which
there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness
for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or the payment of
which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary in each case other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than any default that
may occur in respect of any Existing Debt on or prior to the end of the Clean-up Period),
whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof,
which default:


-----

(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final
maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such
Indebtedness (a “payment default”); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity
(the “cross-acceleration provision”),

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness subject to such
payment defaults or accelerations (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods),
is in excess of the greater of (x) €86.5 million and (y) an amount equal to 25% of LTM
EBITDA;

(e) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Parent, the Issuer or
a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”) which, in each case, are
sanctioned by a court and become unconditional;

(f) failure by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of the greater of (x) €86.5 million and (y) an amount equal to 25% of LTM
EBITDA, other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance
policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments
remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days (after
receipt of notice as described in the second paragraph of this section) after such
judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an
enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or
decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(g) any Security Interest under the Transaction Security Documents having a fair market
value in excess of the greater of (x) €35.0 million and (y) an amount equal to 10% of
LTM EBITDA shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Transaction Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture)
for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture
or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Transaction Security Documents or any such Security Interest created thereunder shall
be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such
Default continues for 30 days (the “security default provisions”); and

(h) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Note
Guarantee of any one or more Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary is held in any
judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full
force and effect, or any one or more Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary denies
or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues
for 10 days (the “guarantee default provisions”).

However, a Default under clauses (c), (d) or (f) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event
of Default unless (i) the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes have notified the Issuer of the Default and (ii) the Issuer has not cured such Default
within 60 days after receipt of such notice; provided that notice of Default may not be given with respect
to any action taken and reported to the Trustee more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any
time period providing for the cure of any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default described under
the first paragraph of this section may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the
extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation.


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of
this section) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at
least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee,
may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, subject to the
provisions of the next paragraph, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all
the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the
Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (d) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Event of Default pursuant to such clause (d) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described
in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of
Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e)
of the first paragraph of this covenant) or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under
the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first
paragraph of this covenant), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first
paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph
of this covenant) or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default the first
paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph
of this covenant) (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing
Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the
Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is a Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant
Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are
not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction
relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default
is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder
must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other
information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of
such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a
“Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the
Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required
hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System
or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any
relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate (which shall be provided to the Holders) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith
that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its
Position Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent
jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its
Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically
stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such
matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from
acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a
Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction
rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time, not in breach of its Position Representation or its
Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that


-----

resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of
such Verification Covenant. If there is any breach of the Position Representation or failure to satisfy its
Verification Covenant in accordance with a final and non-appealable court determination or order, then
for purposes of determining the requisite level of consent for such Noteholder Direction, that breaching
Holder’s position shall be treated as “not outstanding” for purposes of determining the denominator in
the calculation of the requisite level of consent (and their position may not also be included in the
numerator); and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by
the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly
provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect
that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration
rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice
of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted
from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If
the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act
in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s
participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the
Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with
such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described
above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction (provided that
the relevant Position Representations are provided in accordance with the provisions of the preceding
paragraph) or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification,
investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein.

Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any Agent) shall not
be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the
foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under
the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in good faith (provided that the Trustee’s conduct does not
constitute gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud). The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to
monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate
the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any position representation or Officer’s Certificate, as
the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has
breached its position representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court
proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or
Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or
determinations with respect to any derivative instruments, Net Short position, long derivative
instrument, short derivative instrument or otherwise. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on its rights,
protections and benefits under the Indenture at all times, including without limitation, for actions that
are taken and subsequently stayed or annulled.

If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section occurs and is
continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and
be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may
waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which
may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.


-----

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant titled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver
any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured
upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue
any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing and, if in respect of any Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section
(other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant),
such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant;

(2) Holders, or in the case of any Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other
than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this covenant),
Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant,
of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders, or Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation (as
applicable), have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in
the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its
own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Indenture or that the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the
rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any
action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory
to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or
not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the
Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the
Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default


-----

in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests
of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (or if such day is not a Business Day,
on the next succeeding Business Day) after the end of each fiscal year (or in the case of the first fiscal
year ending after the Issue Date, 150 days), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers
thereof know of any Default that has occurred during the previous year, and is continuing. The Issuer
is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any
events that are continuing of which it is aware the occurrence of which would constitute certain
Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture and the other Note Documents
may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions,
any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of
principal or premium, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on any Note (including in connection with
an offer to purchase), except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded)
or compliance with any provision of the Indenture and the other Note Documents may be waived with
the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, such Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one or more series of
Notes (but not all series of Notes), only the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected (and not the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) and
(9) of this paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes (provided, however,
that if any amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect one or
more series of Notes (but not all series of Notes), only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in
the case of clauses (7) and (9) below, 80%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes of the series so affected will be required), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any
Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note
(other than provisions relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions
relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”
and “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the contractual right of any Holder of any outstanding Note to institute suit for the
enforcement of any payment of principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such
Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes”
that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends


-----

the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the
Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes
so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any,
in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Charged Property (taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Transaction
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice
to the provisions governing a Change of Control, the release of less than all or substantially all
Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Charged Property (taken as a
whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver
or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require
the Holders” consent described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Document to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum
denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person or a co-issuer of the obligations of the Issuer
or a Guarantor under any Note Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a
Permitted Transaction;

(3) add to the covenants, add an obligor or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the
Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the
Holders or make any change (including changing the ISIN, common code or other identifying
number on any Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in
any material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes that may be
issued in compliance with the Indenture;

(6) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;


-----

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” to add Note_
Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to
confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or
Lien with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking
is provided for under the Indenture, the Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under any Debt Document of a
successor Trustee or successor security agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide
for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Note Document;

(9) in the case of the Transaction Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant
a Security Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second
Lien Facility Agreement, in any property which is required by the Transaction Security
Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is
required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security
Interest in the Charged Property for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of
such Security Interest is permitted by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) conform the text of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Transaction Security
Documents or the Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that
such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a recitation of a provision
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents or the
Notes;

(11) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending
of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration
of Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not
result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer
Notes in any material respect;

(12) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(13) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and “—Merger and_
_Consolidation,” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; and_

(14) comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements”._

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” or this section shall be deemed to impair or affect
any rights of Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.


-----

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment, supplement or waiver of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent
approves the substance thereof. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture
by any Holder given in connection with a sale or tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered
invalid by such sale or tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (3) and (6) of the third paragraph of this section to add a Guarantor under the
Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such
additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor
and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized
and executed by the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to
Holders.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer, or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer, will be
considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee
will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a responsible
officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned will be so disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt,
any Independent Debt Fund shall not be considered to be a Person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Parent, the Issuer and the Guarantors under
the Note Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts,
duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance
option, the Transaction Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate
(other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries under
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” and “—Merger and Consolidation” (other than
clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control”
and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the
operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy
provisions (other than with respect to the Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee
provision, and the security default provision described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant
_defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (c), (d), (e) (other than with respect
only to the Issuer), (f) or (g) under “—Events of Default” above.


-----

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in euro or European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the
Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires
the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any
such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or
prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit
that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption, and (ii)
must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that
Holders and beneficial owners will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the
Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided
for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been
complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents, will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and
certain surviving rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when
(1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter
the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b)
all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii)
will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee or the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the
Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, money
in euro or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient to pay
and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of
deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption
date, as the case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of satisfying and discharging the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required
to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption, and any Applicable Premium


-----

Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the
deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall
be applied toward such redemption; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable
under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the
Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the “—
Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with; _provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s_
Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and
(4)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request may be included
in the above-mentioned Officer’s Certificate), the Trustee will distribute any amounts deposited to the
Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that
the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier
repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the
distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not
include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such
amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the
Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is
against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such
Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under
the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent person would use in conducting its own
affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the
Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty. Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless
such Holder has offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole
discretion against any loss, liability or expense.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage
in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has actual knowledge that it has or has
acquired a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or


-----

becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a
bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and
appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes
and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. In formulating its decisions,
the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

**Notices**

If and for so long as Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be sent to the
Authority.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at
their respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long
as any Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to the Relevant
Clearing Systems in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems,
delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such
notices to the Holders of book-entry interests. To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of the
Relevant Clearing Systems conflict with any such requirements, a notice will be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of the Indenture if it complies with the mandatory rules and procedures of the Relevant
Clearing Systems.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; _provided that, if_
notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and
the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed
to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such
Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or
communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other
Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed in the manner provided
above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given
through a Relevant Clearing System, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to such Relevant
Clearing System.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment
thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be
prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the required currency (the “Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable
by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees
thereof, if any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the
applicable Required Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a
court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by
any Holder, any Paying Agent or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from


-----

the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable,
to the extent of the amount of the applicable Required Currency which the recipient is able to purchase
with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery
(or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable
to do so). If the amount of the applicable Required Currency is less than the amount of the Required
Currency expressed to be due to the recipient, any Paying Agent or the Trustee under any Note, the
Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the
Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient, any Paying
Agent or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein
for the Holder of a Note or any Paying Agent or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any
such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s
and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will
apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note, any Paying Agent or the Trustee
(other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite
any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any
Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for
purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent
amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the
case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to
deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining
this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a material portion of the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within
the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in the
United States of America. The Indenture will provide that each of the Issuer and the Guarantors will
appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture,
the Notes and the Note Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the
City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the
consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The


-----

Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The Transaction Security Documents will
be governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Charged Property.

Contingent Obligations to repay, redeem or repurchase any such principal prior to the date originally

“Subordinated Indebtedness” means, with respect to any person, any Indebtedness (whether outstanding
on the Issue Date or thereafter Incurred) which is expressly subordinated in right of payment or security
to the Notes pursuant to a written agreement or which constitutes Second Lien Liabilities (as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement). No Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated in right of payment
to any other Indebtedness solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior
basis or on different assets, or due to the fact that holders (or an agent, trustee or representative thereof)
of any Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor or similar arrangements giving one or more of such
holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them or by virtue of the application of
“waterfall” or similar payment ordering provisions affecting tranches of Indebtedness.

“Subordinated Liabilities” has the meaning given to that term in the Intercreditor Agreement.

“Subordinated Shareholder Funding” means, collectively, any funds provided to the Issuer by any

issued to and held by any of the foregoing persons, together with any such security, instrument or
agreement and any other security or instrument other than Capital Stock issued in payment of any


-----

obligation under any Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that such Subordinated Shareholder
Funding:

(a) does not mature or require any amortization, redemption or other repayment of
principal or any sinking fund payment prior to the date that is 6 months after the Stated
Maturity of the Notes (other than through conversion or exchange of such funding into
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or any funding meeting the
requirements of this definition) or the making of any such payment prior to the date
that is six months after the Stated Maturity of the Notes is restricted by the Intercreditor
Agreement, an Additional Intercreditor Agreement or another intercreditor agreement;

(b) does not require, prior to the date that is six months after the Stated Maturity of the

such action or provision or the exercise of any rights or enforcement action, in each
case, prior to the date that is six months after the Stated Maturity of the Notes is
restricted by the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(d) does not provide for or require any security interest or encumbrance over any asset of
the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries;

(e) pursuant to its terms or to the Intercreditor Agreement, an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or another intercreditor agreement, is fully subordinated and junior in right
of payment to the Notes and any Note Guarantee pursuant to subordination, payment
blockage and enforcement limitation terms which are customary in all material respects
for similar funding or are no less favorable in any material respect to Holders than those
contained in the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date with respect to
the Subordinated Liabilities;

(f) is not Guaranteed by any Subsidiary of the Issuer; and

(g) does not (including upon the happening of any event) restrict the payment of amounts
due in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee thereof or compliance by the Issuer
or any Guarantor with its obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantee or the
Indenture.

“Subsidiary” means, in relation to any person, any entity which is controlled directly or indirectly by
that Person and any entity (whether or not so controlled) treated as a subsidiary in the latest financial
statements of that person from time to time, and control for this purpose means the direct or indirect
ownership of the majority of the voting share capital of such entity or the right or ability to direct
management to comply with the type of material restrictions and obligations contemplated in the
Indenture or to determine the composition of a majority of the Board of Directors (or like board) of

Issuer and/or any of its Subsidiaries and any Parent Entity in order to satisfy the obligations arising
under any such Tax Sharing Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, distributions for

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Notes sold outside the United States in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and
together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes
will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and,
together with the 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The
Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s
account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability
to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners
of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive
physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be
considered the registered owners or “Holder” of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable (or its respective nominee), will be considered the holder of the Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. As such, participants and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent or the Agents nor any of their respective agents will
have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default (as defined under
“Description of the Notes”) under the Indenture; or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or
cause to be issued, Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that
legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note
will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note
will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not
transferred or redeemed; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are
mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and
the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement
Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require
a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient
in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee and the Agents appointed pursuant
to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced.
We, the Trustee and/or the Registrar may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions
of the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay,
redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer
Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Agents and any of their respective agents shall be
entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person
will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a
means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the BookEntry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts
in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of
the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption


-----

of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on
such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational
procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount at
maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying
Agent will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, each Agent and any of
their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or their respective nominees) as the owner thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents
nor any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any
such payments made by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- payments made by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments
made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the custodian or common depositary, as applicable.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in “street name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Initial Purchasers, the Agents nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global
Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from
any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be
subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
euro.


-----

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the BookEntry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event
of Default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global
Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be done in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires
physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons
in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must
transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only
upon receipt by the Trustee or the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act). Through and
including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the closing
of the Offering (the “distribution compliance period”), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be
limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests
through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be
permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to (i) a person who takes delivery
in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor to the Trustee or the
Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional
buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.”
Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes of any series that is transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of such series will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry
Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions,
if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as
it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.


-----

In connection with transfers involving exchanges between Regulation S Book-Entry Interests and 144A
Book-Entry Interests, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount
of the relevant Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the other relevant
Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only
if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee or the Transfer Agent a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer
restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are
controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Agents nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will
receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the
Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective
system’s rules and operating procedures.

Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be
effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating
procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such


-----

procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Agents nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for
the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the Business Day following the settlement date against payment for value
on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.

**CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS**

_The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice_
_currently applicable in the Netherlands and the United States and does not purport to address the tax_
_consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax_
_consequences of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of_
_interest and premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

_The summaries set forth below are based upon, as applicable, Dutch or U.S. law as in effect on the date_
_of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any change in such law that may take effect after such_
_date. References in this section to holders of the Notes include the beneficial owners of the Notes. Terms_
_defined under each subsection related to Dutch and U.S. tax law below only have such meanings as_
_defined therein for such respective section. The statements regarding Dutch and U.S. laws and practices_
_set forth below assume that the Notes will be issued, and the transfers thereof will be made, in_
_accordance with the Indenture._

_The discussion below is a general summary. It does not cover all tax matters that may be of importance_
_to a particular investor each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax advisor about the tax_
_consequences to it of an investment in the Notes in light of the investor’s own circumstances._

**Taxation in the Netherlands**

This section outlines the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, settlement,
redemption and disposal of the Notes. It does not present a comprehensive or complete description of
all aspects of Dutch tax law which could be relevant to a holder of the Notes (a “Noteholder”). For
Dutch tax purposes, a Noteholder may include an individual or entity that does not hold the legal title
of the Notes, but to whom or to which, the Notes are, or income from the Notes is, nevertheless
attributed based either on this individual or entity owning a beneficial interest in the Notes or on specific
statutory provisions. These include statutory provisions attributing the Notes to an individual who is, or
who has directly or indirectly inherited from a person who was, the settlor, grantor or similar originator
of a trust, foundation or similar entity that holds the Notes.

This section is intended as general information only. Prospective Noteholders should consult their own
tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of any acquisition, holding or disposal of the Notes.

This section is based on Dutch tax law as applied and interpreted by Dutch tax courts and as published
and in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum, including the tax rates applicable on that date,
without prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without
retroactive effect.

Any reference in this section made to Dutch taxes, Dutch tax or Dutch tax law should be construed as
a reference to any taxes of any nature levied by or on behalf of the Netherlands or any of its subdivisions
or taxing authorities or to the law governing such taxes, respectively. The Netherlands means the part
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands located in Europe.

**_Withholding Tax_**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under the Notes may be made free of withholding or
deduction of, for or on account of any taxes of whatever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed
by the Netherlands or any political subdivision thereof or therein, except that Dutch withholding tax at
a rate of 25.8% (rate for 2022) may apply with respect to payments of interest made or deemed to be
made by or on behalf of the Issuer, if the interest payments are made or deemed to be made to an entity
related to the Issuer (within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021; Wet bronbelasting
_2021) (see below), if such related entity:_


-----

(i) is considered to be resident (gevestigd) in a jurisdiction that is listed in the
yearly updated Dutch Regulation on low-taxing states and non-cooperative
jurisdictions for tax purposes (Regeling laagbelastende staten en niet_coöperatieve_ _rechtsgebieden_ _voor_ _belastingdoeleinden)_ (a “Listed
Jurisdiction”); or

(ii) has a permanent establishment located in a Listed Jurisdiction to which the
interest payment is attributable; or

(iii) is entitled to the interest payment with the main purpose or one of the main
purposes of avoiding taxation for another person or entity and there is an
artificial arrangement or transaction or a series of artificial arrangements or
transactions; or

(iv) is not considered to be the recipient of the interest in its jurisdiction of
residence because such jurisdiction treats another entity as the recipient of the
interest (a hybrid mismatch); or

(v) is not resident in any jurisdiction (also a hybrid mismatch); or

(vi) is a reverse hybrid (within the meaning of Article 2(12) of the Dutch Corporate
Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969) (the
“CITA”)), if and to the extent (x) there is a participant in the reverse hybrid
holding a Qualifying Interest in the reverse hybrid, (y) the jurisdiction of
residence of the participant holding the Qualifying Interest in the reverse
hybrid treats the reverse hybrid as transparent for tax purposes and (z) such
participant would have been subject to Dutch withholding tax in respect of the
payments of interest without the interposition of the reverse hybrid,

all within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021.

_Related entity_

For purposes of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021, an entity is considered to be an entity related to
the Issuer if:

(i) such entity has a Qualifying Interest (as defined below) in the Issuer;

(ii) the Issuer has a Qualifying Interest in such entity; or

(iii) a third party has a Qualifying Interest in both the Issuer and such entity.

The term “Qualifying Interest” means a direct or indirectly held interest – either by an entity
individually or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group (samenwerkende groep) – that enables
such entity or such collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entity's decisions
and allows it to determine the other entity's activities (as interpreted by the European Court of Justice
in case law on the right of freedom of establishment (vrijheid van vestiging)).

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

Please note that the summary in this section does not describe the Dutch tax consequences for:

(i) a Noteholder if such Noteholder is an individual and the Noteholder’s income
or capital gains derived from the Notes are attributable to employment
activities, which income is taxable in the Netherlands;


-----

(ii) a Noteholder if such holder has a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or
a deemed substantial interest (fictief aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer under
the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001). Generally, a
Noteholder is considered to hold a substantial interest in such company, if such
holder alone or—in the case of an individual—together with a partner for
Dutch tax purposes, or any relative by blood or by marriage in the ascending
or descending line (including foster children) of the Noteholder or the partner,
owns or holds, or is deemed to own or hold, certain rights to shares, including
rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, shares, representing 5% or more of the
Issuer’s issued capital as a whole or for any class of shares or profit
participating certificates (winstbewijzen) relating to 5% or more of the Issuer’s
annual profits or 5% or more of the Issuer’s liquidation proceeds. A deemed
substantial interest may arise if a substantial interest (or part thereof) in a
company has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, on a
non-recognition basis;

(iii) an entity that, although it is in principle subject to Dutch corporate income tax
under the CITA, is not subject to Dutch corporate income tax or is fully or
partly exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as a qualifying pension
fund as described in section 5 CITA and a tax exempt investment fund
(vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 6a CITA);

(iv) an investment institution (beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 28
CITA; or

(v) that is an entity which is a resident of Aruba, Curacao or St. Maarten and fully
or partly conducts a business through a permanent establishment (vaste
_inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in_
Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba to which the Notes are attributable.

_Residents of the Netherlands_

The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following
Noteholders:

(i) individuals who are resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands
(“Dutch Resident Individuals”); and

(ii) entities or enterprises that are subject to the CITA and are resident or deemed
to be resident in the Netherlands (“Dutch Resident Corporate Entities”).

_Dutch Resident Individuals_

Dutch Resident Individuals are generally subject to income tax at statutory progressive rates with a
maximum of 49.50% on any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes, including any
capital gains realized on any disposal, including the exchange or deemed exchange, of the Notes, where
those benefits are attributable to:

(i) an enterprise from which a Dutch Resident Individual derives profits, whether
as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or by being co-entitled (medegerechtigde) to
the net worth of the enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or shareholder; or

(ii) miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden), including
activities beyond the scope of active portfolio investment activities (meer dan
_normaal vermogensbeheer)._


-----

If the above-mentioned conditions (i) and (ii) do not apply to the Dutch Resident Individual, the Dutch
Resident Individual's net investment assets (rendementsgrondslag) for the year will be subject to an
annual Dutch income tax on a deemed return (with a maximum of 5.53% in 2022) under the regime for
savings and investments (inkomen uit sparen en beleggen), insofar the Dutch Resident Individual's net
investment assets for the year exceed a statutory threshold (heffingvrij vermogen).

The deemed return on the Dutch Resident Individual's net investment assets for the year is taxed at a
flat rate of 31% (rate for 2022). Actual income or capital gains realized in respect of the Notes are as
such not subject to Dutch income tax.

The net investment assets for the year are the fair market value of the investment assets less the
allowable liabilities on 1 January of the relevant calendar year. The Notes are included as investment
assets.

The annual taxable benefit from a Dutch Resident Individual's assets and liabilities taxed under this
regime, including the Notes, is based on the actual allocation of the Dutch Resident Individual's assets
and liabilities over the following three categories: (i) bank savings, (ii) other investments, including the
Notes, and (iii) liabilities. The tax is calculated as follows:

(i) a deemed return on the fair market value of the actual amount of bank savings;
_plus_

(ii) a deemed return on the fair market value of the actual amount of other
investments, including the Notes; minus

(iii) a deemed return on the fair market value of the actual amount of liabilities.

The statutory threshold is divided pro-rata over the three assets and liabilities categories mentioned
above. At the date hereof, the deemed return under (i) to (iii) above have not yet been determined for
the year 2023. The definitive percentages for the year 2023 will be published in the first months of
2024. Transactions in the 3-month period before and after 1 January implemented to arbitrate between
the deemed return percentages applicable to bank savings, other investments and liabilities will for this
purpose be ignored if the holder of Notes cannot sufficiently demonstrate that such transactions are
implemented for other than tax reasons.

_Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_

Dutch Resident Corporate Entities are generally subject to corporate income tax on any benefits derived
or deemed to be derived from the Notes or any capital gains realized on the disposal or deemed disposal,
including the exchange or deemed exchange, of the Notes at a rate of 15% with respect to taxable profits
up to €395,000 and 25.8% with respect to taxable profits in excess of that amount up to 25.8% (rates
and brackets for 2022).

_Non-Residents of the Netherlands_

The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following
Noteholders:

(i) individuals who are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands (“Non-Dutch Resident Individuals”); and

(ii) entities that are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the Netherlands
(“Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities”).

_Non-Dutch Resident Individuals_


-----

A Non-Dutch Resident Individual will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains
derived from the purchase, ownership and disposal, including the exchange or deemed exchange, or
transfer of the Notes, other than withholding tax as described above, unless:

(i) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives profits from an enterprise, whether
as entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of this
enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or shareholder, and this enterprise is
fully or partly carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting)
or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands, to
which the Notes are attributable;

(ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives benefits from miscellaneous
activities carried on in the Netherlands in respect of the Notes, including
activities which are beyond the scope of active portfolio investment activities;
or

(iii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual is entitled to a share—other than by way
of securities—in the profits of an enterprise, which is effectively managed in
the Netherlands and to which the Notes are attributable.

_Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_

A Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital
gains derived from the purchase, ownership and disposal, including the exchange or deemed exchange,
or transfer of the Notes, other than withholding tax as described above, unless:

(i) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity derives profits from an enterprise,
which is fully or partly carried on through a permanent establishment or a
permanent representative in the Netherlands to which the Notes are
attributable; or

(ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity is entitled to a share—other than by
way of securities—in the profits of an enterprise or a co-entitlement to the net
worth of an enterprise, which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to
which the Notes are attributable.

Under certain specific circumstances, Dutch taxation rights may be restricted for Non-Dutch Resident
Individuals and Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities pursuant to treaties for the avoidance of double
taxation.

**_Dutch Gift Tax or Inheritance Tax_**

No Dutch gift tax or inheritance tax is due in respect of any gift of the Notes by, or inheritance of the
Notes on the death of, a Noteholder, unless:

(i) the Noteholder is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at
the time of the gift or death of the Noteholder;

(ii) the Noteholder dies within 180 days after the date of the gift of the Notes and
was, or was deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands at the time of the
Noteholder’s death but not at the time of the gift;

(iii) the gift of the Notes is made under a condition precedent and the Noteholder
is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time the
condition is fulfilled; or


-----

(iv) the transfer is otherwise construed as a gift or inheritance made by, or on behalf
of, a person who, at the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident
of the Netherlands.

**_Value Added Tax (VAT)_**

No Dutch VAT will be payable by a Noteholder on (i) any payment in consideration for the issue of the
Notes or (ii) the payment of interest or principal by the Issuer under the Notes.

**_Stamp Duties_**

No Dutch documentation taxes (commonly referred to as stamp duties) will be payable by a Noteholder
in respect of (i) the issue of the Notes or (ii) the payment of interest or principal by the Issuer under the
Notes.

**_Residency_**

A Noteholder will not become a resident or deemed resident of the Netherlands by reason only of
holding the Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
tax effects. The summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except
for the discussions below under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,” and does not address the effects
of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws)
or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any
time, possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the U.S. federal tax consequences
described below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected
to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a
court will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or
disposition of the Notes than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in
the event of litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount,
timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant
to a U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the
Medicare tax on net investment income, the alternative minimum tax, or the base erosion and anti-abuse
tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, certain financial
institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement and other tax deferred
accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders who elect to mark their investment to market, U.S.
Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt entities, regulated investment
companies, tax exempt organizations, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, S corporations, or other
pass through entities and investors in such entities, entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules,
persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction,” “constructive sale”
or other integrated transaction, persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock
(by vote or value) and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with
respect to the Notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in
Section 451 of the Code). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for
cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the
Notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or


-----

organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the
Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of
the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation
(or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized
in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
(iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
(iv) a trust if it is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
“United States persons” (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust, or if the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury
regulations to be treated as a “United States person” (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code).

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the
Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and
partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general
information purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors
concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including
the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application
of other federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

**_IPO Debt Pushdown_**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described under
“Description of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice
that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the
basis that references to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply
only to the IPO Debt Pushdown Entity and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries. Such a
modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such
modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed
exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain
beneficial owners of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. The amount of any gain or
loss recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a Note for a New Note would be determined by
reference to the “issue price” of the New Note. The issue price of a New Note will equal the fair market
value of such Note or such New Note at the time of the deemed exchange if such Note or such New
Note were considered “publicly traded” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Debt Pushdown
is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder’s holding period
in a New Note treated as received in the IPO Debt Pushdown generally will commence on the day after
the IPO Debt Pushdown, and tax basis in such New Note would generally equal the issue price of such
New Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of such deemed exchange will be taxed
under the rules described under “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable
_Disposition of Notes.” If the issue price of such New Note is less than its stated redemption price at_
maturity by a de minimis amount or more than a de minimis amount, such New Note will be treated as
issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required
to include such OID in their income (as ordinary income) as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash
corresponding to such income on the Notes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to
the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the
IPO Debt Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and


-----

resulting OID, if any. In addition, the determination of whether the deemed New Notes are treated as
foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments would be made at the time of the modification.

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are
withheld or deducted from payments on the Notes (as described under “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes”) or make payments in redemption of the Notes in addition to their stated principal_
amount and accrued interest (as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”). If any such payment is treated as a contingent
payment, subject to certain exceptions, the Notes may be treated as foreign currency contingent payment
debt instruments, in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income
recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Although the issue is not free
from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying such additional amounts or
making additional payments in redemption of the Notes does not result in the Notes being treated as
foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury regulations. This
position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the
possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid, or additional payments in redemption of the
Notes will have to be made, is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable
Treasury regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments is
binding on a U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the
year during which such U.S. Holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However,
our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a
U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield,
regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a
fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar
to those of the Notes, and may exceed the stated interest rate. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange,
redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes would generally be recharacterized as ordinary
income. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the
Notes being treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this
discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt
instruments.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount of stated interest on a Note (as
well as any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any
amounts withheld) will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued
in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes.

If you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be
required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest received, determined by
translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or
loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable
to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so received.

If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may determine
the amount of income recognized with respect to such stated interest in accordance with either of two
methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the
U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such
interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or,
in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period


-----

within each taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at
the spot rate on: (1) the last day of the accrual period; (2) the last day of the portion of the accrual period
within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or (3) the date the
stated interest payment is received if such date is within five Business Days of the end of the accrual
period. This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold at the beginning of the first taxable year
to which the election applies or thereafter acquire and cannot be changed without the consent of the
IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Note (including,
upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest previously included in income), a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will recognize ordinary income or loss in an amount equal
to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the
foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar
value of the stated interest income such U.S. Holder previously included in income with respect to such
payment. This exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will
be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or
expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the Notes are issued at an “issue price” (as defined above) which is less than their stated redemption
price at maturity such Notes will be considered to have been issued with OID for U.S. federal income
tax purposes unless the difference is less than a de minimis threshold (generally equal to ¼ of 1% of the
Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their “issue
date”). The “issue date” is the first date upon which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for cash
to persons other than bondhouses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers.

If the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally
will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant
yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. Subject
to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for
a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during
that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined
by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” (other than the initial short accrual period and the final
accrual period) a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any
accrual period generally will equal the excess, if any, of (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of
the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield to maturity” (determined on
the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the
accrual period) over (b) the aggregate of all qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The
term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash
or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at
least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain circumstances, at a variable rate. Stated interest on
the Notes should be treated as qualified stated interest. The “yield to maturity” is the discount rate that,
when applied to all payments under a Note as of its issue date, results in a present value equal to the
Note’s issue price. In general, the “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of the first accrual
period is its issue price and, on any day thereafter, is the sum of the issue price and the amount of OID
previously included in the gross income of any U.S. Holder, reduced by the amount of any payment
(other than a payment of qualified stated interest) previously made on the Note.

OID will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into United States dollars in
the same manner as stated interest income accrued by a holder on the accrual basis, as described above.


-----

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the
sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in
income) to the extent of the difference between the United States dollar value of such payment
(determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is
received) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued
interest). Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be
treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income. For these
purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed: first, as the receipt of any stated interest payments called
for under the terms of the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof),
with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as the receipt of
principal.

A U.S. Holder may irrevocably elect, subject to certain limitations, to treat all interest on any Note as
OID and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the method described above. The
election is to be made for the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note and may not be
revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about this
election.

The rules regarding OID are complex and the rules described above may not apply in all cases.
Accordingly, you should consult your tax advisors regarding their application.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income (as well as any Additional Amounts) and accrued OID, if any, on a Note generally
will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in
computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any
non-U.S. withholding tax with respect to the Notes held by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such
holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. There are significant limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax
credits. The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S.
Holder’s particular circumstances, and recent U.S. regulations have imposed additional requirements
that must be met for a foreign tax to be creditable (including requirements that a “covered withholding
tax” be imposed on nonresidents in lieu of a generally applicable tax that satisfies the regulatory
definition of an “income tax,” which may be unclear or difficult to determine). U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
realized upon such disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued OID or accrued but unpaid
interest not previously included in income, which will be taxable as such) and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be
based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate on the date of disposition.
In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis
U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of
such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the
disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the sale or other
disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual
basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the
extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date,
and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.


-----

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the amount paid for such Note by such
U.S. Holder, increased by any previously accrued OID, if any. If a U.S. Holder uses foreign currency
to purchase a Note, the amount paid for the Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency purchase price determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase. In the case of a Note that is
considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it makes
the special election described in the preceding paragraph, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine
the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price at the spot rate on the settlement date of the
purchase.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and, except as discussed below with respect to
foreign currency gain or loss, generally will be long term capital gain or loss so long as the U.S. Holder
has held the Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of noncorporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount
of such Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income,
respectively, and will generally be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest
income or expense, including for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. For these purposes, the
“principal amount” of a Note is the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Note. Gain or
loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such
Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount
of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note and (ii) the
U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S.
Holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss
attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest or accrued OID, if
any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” and “—Original
_Issue Discount,” respectively. However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable_
disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will realize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including
with respect to principal amount and accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if any) only
to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax
shelter transactions may cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including
certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (e.g.,
$50,000 in the case of an individual or trust), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or OID or a sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received
in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the
tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Individuals and certain entities that own “specified foreign financial assets” (as defined in Section
6038D of the Code) with an aggregate value exceeding certain threshold amounts (including certain
amounts at any time during the tax year), generally are required to file an information report with respect
to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets
subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial
institutions.


-----

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the significant penalties for noncompliance.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and stated interest
(and the accrual of OID, if any) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition
(including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an
exempt recipient (such as a corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption.
The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding,
currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments if (1) the U.S. Holder fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer
identification number or to establish an exemption from backup withholding; (2) the IRS notifies the
payor that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the U.S. Holder is incorrect; (3) there has
been a “notified payee underreporting” described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (4) the U.S. Holder
has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number,
that it is a “United States person,” (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and that the IRS has
not notified such U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided that
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the effect, if any, of the backup withholding rules on their particular circumstances.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru
payments” to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Under
proposed Treasury regulations, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is two years after the date
on which applicable final Treasury regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are filed generally
would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified more than six months after
such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury regulations have not
yet been filed. Accordingly, even if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would
apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have
entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States
to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. holders should consult
their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any
withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will
be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain General Tax Considerations**

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the
provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption that may apply. It is not
certain that such payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for such exemptions. Holders of Notes
should consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a Guarantor makes any
payments with respect to the Notes.


-----

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer and the Original Guarantor are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and the
entities that we currently expect to accede as Post-Closing Guarantors are incorporated or organized
under the laws of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The documents relating to the Collateral will
be governed by the laws of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The Indenture (including the Note
Guarantees) and the Notes will be governed by New York law. All of the directors and executive
officers of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since most of
the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive officers, are located
outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor
or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon
civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States.
Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors located outside the United States will
appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New
York courts (in the case of any Post-Closing Guarantor, upon accession), in each case, in connection
with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be
possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above
within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions
of U.S. federal securities laws. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other
jurisdictions upon those persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors provided that, for example, The Hague
Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial
Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor (in the case of any PostClosing Guarantor, upon accession), investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where
the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the
United States is described below for the countries in which the Issuer or each of the Guarantors or the
Collateral is located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed
to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**The Netherlands**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law. As a result, it may be difficult for
investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Issuer or any Guarantor
incorporated under Dutch law.

The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial
matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or
state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United
States federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands.
In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re litigated
before a competent Dutch court. Under current practice, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected
to render a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant U.S. court, provided that such
judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction
vis à vis the Issuer or a Guarantor incorporated under Dutch law on the basis of internationally accepted
grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) has not been rendered in violation of elementary principles of fair trial, (iii)
is not contrary to the public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands and (iv) is not incompatible with
(a) a prior judgment of a Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior
judgment of a non-Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same
subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is capable of
being recognized in the Netherlands.


-----

Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement
and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in The Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions
of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).

**Belgium**

Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Belgium. In the absence of any bilateral or
multilateral treaty, final and enforceable judgments rendered by foreign courts can be declared
enforceable in Belgium (without review of the foreign judgment on the merits by the Belgian courts)
according to the procedure set out in Articles 22 and sq. of the Belgian Code of Private International
Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit International Privé) and provided that,
pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents are
produced in court by the claimant:

- an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling
all conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

- if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the
originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign
law or an equivalent document in accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstrating
that the judgment was served or notified to the party that did not appear; and

- any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable
and has been notified to the defendant.

However, the court will refuse recognition and enforcement in the circumstances described in Article
25 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law and notably (and, inter alia), if:

- the consequences of the enforcement of the judgment would be manifestly contrary to Belgian
public policy;

- the rights of defense were not respected;

- the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets
in such state without any further connection with the litigation in such state;

- without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the
judgment is not final or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the laws of
the State where the judgment was rendered or the applicable federal rules;

- if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has
been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in
accordance with Belgian conflict of law rules;

- the decision is in conflict with either a decision rendered in Belgium or a decision previously
rendered in another state and such decision can be recognized in Belgium;

- the claim was introduced before the courts of such state after a claim, which is still pending and
relating to the same matter and between the same parties, was introduced in a Belgian court;

- the Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the claim; or

- the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions
in relation to insolvency proceedings or corporate standing.


-----

Note that, in accordance with Article 25, §2 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, Belgian
courts will not carry out a review on the merits of the foreign judgment for which enforcement is sought.

As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex
_fori). In Belgium the procedural rules contained in, amongst others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the_
Code of Private International Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered
by foreign courts is sought in Belgium.

In accordance with Articles 23 and 148 of the Belgian Code of Registration Duties, a registration duty
at the rate of 3% of the amount of the judgment is levied in respect of a Belgian decision which
authorizes enforcement of a judgment rendered by a foreign court, payable by the debtor, if the sum of
money which the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court judgment, or by a foreign court judgment
that is either: (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium; or (ii) rendered enforceable by a
Belgian court, exceeds EUR 12,500.

**Germany**

Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Germany. There is doubt as to the enforceability
in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an
original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United
States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial
matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S.
state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any
federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal
or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil
Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the
merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final
under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth
in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

- if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment
did not have jurisdiction;

- if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a
defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads
accordingly;

- if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a
foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany;

- if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible
with a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before
the U.S. federal or state court entered its judgment;

- if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of
German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and
enforce a comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).


-----

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the
effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets
(vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you
that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S.
federal securities laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts
as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are
necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S.
federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would
qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so
far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based
on common law provided for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may,
prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of
witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such
pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court
in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United
States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the
Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the
dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may
render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within Germany upon the Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Germany or those persons
under the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such
service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service
violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte)
guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional
Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action
before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE**
**VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE**
**SECURITY INTERESTS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which the_
_Issuer, the Guarantors and certain subsidiaries are incorporated or organized, and a summary of_
_certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security interests_
_for the Notes. The description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all_
_of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes and the_
_Note Guarantees and the security interests. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own_
_legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of a member state of the European
Union (each member state of the European Union, a “Member State”).

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015
on insolvency proceedings (recast), replacing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000
on insolvency proceedings, as amended (as amended from time to time, the “EU Insolvency
Regulation”), the court which shall have jurisdiction to commence the main insolvency proceedings in
relation to a company (subject to certain exceptions) organized under the laws of a Member State is the
court of the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the relevant Company’s “center of main
interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, “COMI”) is situated.
The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts
of the different Member States may have different and even conflicting views.

COMI is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its
registered office. Recital 28 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should
correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis
and which “is ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are
held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the
large majority of the Company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of
the place where the company has its COMI. A Company’s COMI may change from time to time but is
determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence
insolvency proceedings pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation at the time of the filing of the
insolvency petition. The presumption described above shall however only apply if the registered office
has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the
opening of insolvency proceedings (as defined in Article (3) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). Based
on a recent decision by the European Court of Justice, the court of a Member State with which a request
to open main insolvency proceedings has been lodged retains exclusive jurisdiction to open such
proceedings where the center of the debtor’s main interests is moved to another Member State after that
request has been lodged, but before that court has delivered a decision on it.

If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in a Member State, the main insolvency
proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in
such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types
of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency
proceedings initiated in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are automatically
recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
initiated in another Member State in the event that the company has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other
Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries
on non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”


-----

Secondary proceedings are limited to winding-up proceedings and the effects of such secondary
proceedings are restricted to the assets of the company situated in the territory of such other Member
State.

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been
commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency
proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment
where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the
debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency
proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation
of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial
proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority that has the right to request the opening of insolvency
proceedings under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. When main
insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency
proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex
fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the
insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have
been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly
from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or
intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a
whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of
another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

- the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the
proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

- the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of
the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

- the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or
use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

- a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as
no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a
court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s
COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in
another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to
certain limitations as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member
State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence
insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the
court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member
State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary
has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State.
He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of


-----

the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of
title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that
other Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in
another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member
State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets
or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority
rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were
opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to
approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law
of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a
court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that
the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and
its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not
exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local
creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request
from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months,
unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings.
Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of
realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary
insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing
difficulties by the comment of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency
practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of the
group’s members.

The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 and is therefore no longer
a Member State (including for the purposes of the automatic recognition regime under the EU
Insolvency Regulation). The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146), The
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/1459) and The Insolvency
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/647) set out a number of amendments to the EU
Insolvency Regulation as it applies in the United Kingdom since the end of the transition period on 31
December 2020. There has been no agreement to replace the automatic recognition of United Kingdom
insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. Absent such agreement, recognition in the United
Kingdom of insolvency proceedings opened in an EU Member State is not automatic. However, such
recognition may be available under the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, which
has been implemented in the United Kingdom by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 and
which provides for recognition of insolvency proceedings in other jurisdictions as either foreign main
or foreign non-main proceedings.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**


-----

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending
Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring
Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and
entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring
frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs
(i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby
affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of
restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum
standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of
debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to
address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented
and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for
a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors
must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into
separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of
secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be
restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount
of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected
parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may,
under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more
classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the
plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the
protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption
of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new
financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing
granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States
by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of
communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17,
2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period
for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

In the event that any one of the Issuer or Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations and the security of the Issuer or Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws
of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially
different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of
the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

**The Netherlands**

**_Dutch Insolvency Law_**

The Issuer and some Guarantors are incorporated in the Netherlands. Any insolvency proceeding
concerning the Issuer or any Guarantor incorporated under Dutch law would likely be based on Dutch
insolvency law under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy


-----

proceedings may also be opened in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of
companies that are not incorporated under Dutch law.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are three primary
insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is
intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as
a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and
distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. The third, the Dutch Scheme, allows a
debtor to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings such as suspension of payments
or bankruptcy. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet).
In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles
of the three insolvency regimes is set out below.

_Suspension of Payments_

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it
will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is
filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator
(bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft
composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of
payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive
moratorium.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional
moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more
than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more
than one third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non
preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be
withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of
payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.

The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non preferential creditors.
Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured
creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments,
under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may
enforce their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as
if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale
of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an
interested party the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period
of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during
which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive
moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be
binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the
number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the
claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified
(gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability
of the noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch
moratorium of payments proceeding. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a
moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

_Bankruptcy_

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the


-----

aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and
payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims.
The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment),
which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy
proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain
creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that
take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your
potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in
accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their
terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor incorporated under Dutch law
will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be
submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means
that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in
the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of
claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be
based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy
cannot be verified, unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro
_memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be_
challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting
(verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may
dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed
in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These
procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than
they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such _renvooi proceedings could also cause_
payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in
moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition (akkoord) may be
offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non preferential creditors if it is approved by
(i) a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at
least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii)
subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet)
does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after
satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non
preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a
certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the
way such subordination is construed.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a
Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the
supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two
months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement
actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from
the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its
security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the
secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy,
which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate;
they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An
exception applies in the case of set off relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its
bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee,
although a set off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance
or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a


-----

legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it
guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security
for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing
security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding
or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—
_Fraudulent Transfer.”_

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of
judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect
to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of
law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The
proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy
unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the
preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy
order is automatically stayed.

**_Dutch Scheme_**

As regards the pre-insolvency plan regime, as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility to offer
a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings under the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act on Court Confirmation
of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans”). The pre-insolvency plan regime has been incorporated in the
Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant to this Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans.
Unlike a moratorium and in bankruptcy, a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The Act
on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, _inter alia, for cross class_
cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned
proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court
measures. Such composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors as
compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of
such a composition. A composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial
Restructuring Plans can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law
and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of noteholders.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans voting on a composition plan
is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the
claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of
the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial
Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a nonconsenting class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial
Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other
than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the
debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse
confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting
class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the
distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an
affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates
from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay
on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. During such
period, inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is
suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such


-----

stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of
pledge.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or
security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the
guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver
(curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment
proceedings (surseance van betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and
enforceable against it. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the
interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the
articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether
the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from
the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance
between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. In
addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions
for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may
challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge
would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit
derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of
companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of
the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by
the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial
and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the
granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s
objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company
between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies
with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the
document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog),
duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document.
Payment pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may,
regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances
(onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and
fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract
and set off (verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch
company may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10%
or more of the shares in such company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities
entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or
security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended
or avoided.

According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor
of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or
reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time,
be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the
detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any
circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally
cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.


-----

**_Enforcement of Security Interests_**

In the event of the occurrence of certain events, the Security Agent may enforce the security interests
created pursuant to the relevant security documents governed by Dutch law. In general, under Dutch
insolvency law mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking
security and other liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax
debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances,
the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on inventory (not including
stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these
tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie),
have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme, now must
inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four
weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed.

Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition,
foreclosure on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject
to Dutch law. Under Dutch law, security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the
relevant assets. This auction has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Dutch
Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke
_Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten_
vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance
with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of
foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through
collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless
it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a
private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant
security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become
enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged
assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the
creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security
Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal
obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, and a pledge under
any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The
parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate
or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged,
holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a
Dutch security document. In addition, the holders of the Notes bear the risks associated with the possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a person, including a guarantee or security
interest granted by a legal entity, may under certain circumstances, be nullified by any of its creditors,
if (i) the legal act or the guarantee or security interest was granted without prior existing legal obligation
to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned was/were prejudiced as a consequence of the legal
act or the guarantee or the granting of the security interest and (iii) at the time the legal act or the
guarantee or security interest was granted both the legal entity and, unless the legal act or the guarantee
or security interest was granted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have
known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio


-----

_pauliana). Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a transaction or a guarantee or security_
interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all
creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the transaction or the guarantee or
security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the
debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no
consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy
apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition,
the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the transaction or the guarantee or security interest if it was
conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i)
such transaction was conducted at a time that the counterparty of knew that a request for bankruptcy
had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor
and the counterparty with a view to give preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors.
Consequently, the validity of any such transactions by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is
possible that such challenge would be successful. If a Dutch court found that the granting of a guarantee
or security interest or any other transaction entered into by the Issuer or a Guarantor at any time in
connection with the Notes involved a fraudulent transfer as set out above, then the granting of a
guarantee or security interest or any other transaction entered into by the Issuer or a Guarantor could be
nullified. In the case of successful challenge, holders of the Notes would not enjoy the benefit of such
guarantee or security interests.

It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares
can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created
on collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will
not be subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium
of payments prior to obtaining title thereto.

It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if
created, in respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a
Dutch private limited liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register.
However, this does not constitute conclusive evidence of the absence of any pre-existing security.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

To the extent any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor has its registered seat in Belgium (a “Belgian
Guarantor”), or to the extent Belgium is the territory in which the center of such Belgian Guarantor’s
main interests is situated, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. This also applies
to any debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the center of such debtor’s main interests is
situated. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, the
Belgian law also allows territorial bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of
companies whose center of main interests is not situated in Belgium. The effects of those territorial
bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the assets situated in Belgium. The following is a brief
description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the
present transaction.

Belgian insolvency laws provide for two main insolvency proceedings for enterprises: judicial
reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy
proceedings (faillissement/faillite).

Both types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX “Insolvency of enterprises” of the
Belgian Code of Economic Law (the “Belgian Insolvency Act”).


-----

Belgium is currently implementing the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 on restructuring and insolvency. The
implementation will have an impact on the available reorganization proceedings. However, the date of
implementation is still uncertain and no official legal texts are available yet.

**_Judicial Reorganization_**

A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor)
may file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether
immediately or in the future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s
registered capital (kapitaal/capital), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. A
state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed.

As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not
issued a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the
debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period
between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s
assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests
that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. The filing of the petition does not, however,
have a suspensory effect if the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less
than six months ago (unless the court decides otherwise).

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition,
the court will examine such petition, and within eight days following such examination and subject to
the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open,
allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or
of the judicial trustee in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the
report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to twelvemonths as from the start of the moratorium period. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size
of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the
interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six
months. Special rules apply when a debtor has already requested and obtained a judicial reorganization
procedure in the last three years before the new request.

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to
preexisting claims (i.e., for debts incurred before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization
procedure) in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and
immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few
exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims.
During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the
debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their
conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have
a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of
moveable or immovable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be
continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial
reorganization procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the
receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The
holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the
initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on
financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the
“Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in the Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced
notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse


-----

of right). In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the
event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third
parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the
moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in
respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary
payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary
for the continuity of the enterprise.

During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor
continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court.
However, upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator
(ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d’entreprise) to facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its
assets or its activities. In addition, upon request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the
event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or one of its corporate bodies threatening the
continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can
preserve such continuity, the court may appoint a judicial administrator
(gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice). Finally, in the event of manifestly gross error of the
debtors or one of its corporate bodies, the court may replace them with a temporary administrator
(voorlopig bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) for the duration of the moratorium.

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern.
Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual
provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or
approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not
be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions,
to close out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate
debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral
Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity where the creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the
Belgian Insolvency Act provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s
default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a
15 day period following the notification of such default after granting of the moratorium.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a
contract during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the
decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to
transfer all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor
from suspending the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the
agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations.

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement
between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of
(part of) the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also
depend on the position of the court and/or third parties.

In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the
terms they have agreed. Such in court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned.
The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in
relation to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the
court will record it. The court order confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be
published, without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the
creditors that have agreed to it.

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization
plan during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or
rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The reorganization


-----

plan must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be)
at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to
ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double
majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all
creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not, although only
limited measures can be imposed by such reorganization plan on secured creditors without their
individual consent. The court may refuse ratification if the formalities were not complied with, or if the
proposed reorganization plan violates public policy.

To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following
the ruling declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its
creditors individually of the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the
debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with preexisting claims,
as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the
ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts
and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure.
In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor
or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of
new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month
in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the
amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the
reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the
assistance of the court appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures such as
the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and
may be based on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities.

The court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its
petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor
or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the
court can order such transfer in specific circumstances.

The court ordered transfer will be organized by a judicial administrator
(gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse
of the creditors will be limited to the transfer price, subject to some limited exceptions.

On 21 March 2021, the Belgian Parliament adopted a new act amending the Belgian Insolvency Act
introducing a number of new measures, most notably a “pre-packaged insolvency” (voorbereidend
_akkoord/accord préparatoire) (the “Pre-Pack”) procedure, where the debtor may discretely prepare for_
judicial reorganization proceedings under the supervision of a judicial administrator. These measures
were initially adopted for a limited period ending on 30 June 2021. Pursuant to a Royal Decree those
measures were extended until 16 July 2022. On 3 June 2022, it was decided by the Council of Ministers
to further extend the measures until 31 December 2022.

The purpose of the Pre-Pack is to confidentially test the possibility of an amicable or collective
arrangement with a debtor’s most important creditors prior to formal insolvency proceedings.

This occurs during a Pre-pack phase, i.e. a court supervised preparatory negotiation phase. If the
negotiations in this Pre-pack phase are successful, the Pre-pack phase will be converted into the formal
judicial reorganization proceedings (aimed at obtaining either an amicable agreement with two or more
creditors, or a collective reorganization agreement that is approved by the majority of creditors
representing the majority of the claims and binding on dissenting creditors).


-----

The Pre-pack consists of the following features. A debtor may initiate the Pre-pack procedure by filing
a petition with the President of the competent enterprise court, substantiating that its continuity is at risk
immediately or in the short term.

To ensure confidentiality, the petition is “unilateral” (meaning that creditors are not summoned to share
their views on the petition) and will be decided upon by the President in a hearing behind closed doors
(held within 8 days from the date of the petition). The subsequent decision of the President is not
published in the Belgian Official Gazette. Opposition by third parties is not possible.

If the President decides to refuse the Pre-pack petition, the debtor may appeal such decision within 8
business days after being notified of that decision.

If the President decides to approve the Pre-pack petition, the President will appoint a judicial
administrator. After the appointment of the judicial administrator (which is not published), the debtor
must produce a list of creditors and disclose such list to the judicial administrator.

The judicial administrator will subsequently assist the debtor in negotiating an amicable agreement, or
a collective restructuring plan with either all or some of the creditors.

During the Pre-pack phase, the debtor remains in control and may terminate the Pre-pack procedure at
any time.

If the negotiations conducted by the judicial administrator are successful, the President of the enterprise
court will refer the matter to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court for the formal opening of
judicial reorganization proceedings. Subsequently, an amicable agreement might be sanctioned
(“homologated”) by the court, or the collective restructuring plan might be put to the creditors’ vote.

Once referred, the judicial reorganization proceedings are carried out in an expedited manner. Within 5
business days after referral, the enterprise court will initiate formal judicial reorganization proceedings.

In the event of an amicable agreement, the enterprise court will decide on confirming or rejecting the
amicable settlement within one month.

In the event of a collective restructuring agreement, the creditors will vote on a restructuring plan and
the court will decide on confirming or rejecting the collective agreement within 3 months.

At the request of the judicial administrator, during the Pre-pack procedure, the President of the
enterprise court may subject unwilling or malicious creditors to payment terms and/or payment
conditions as well as stay enforcement measures for a maximum period of four months.

As soon as the matter is referred to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court, the debtor-company
will enjoy the full suspension period (moratorium) offered by the formal judicial reorganization
proceedings (i.e., during which enforcement measures against the company’s assets – for debts incurred
before the opening of the judicial reorganization proceedings – will be suspended).

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the
public prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of
the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of “main insolvency proceedings” opened in another EU Member
State (other than Denmark) in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains
that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’
claims must be submitted to the court for verification.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be
in a situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te


-----

_betalen/cessation de paiements de manière persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens_
_krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that_
the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they fall due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely
temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management
of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes
responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the
distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in
the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis
by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may
request the temporary continued operation of the business.

The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts
existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may only decide not to continue performance of one
or several ongoing contracts when the administration of the estate requires this and such decisions will
not impair any rights in rem of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The other party to an
ongoing contract may demand the receiver to take a decision within fifteen days. If no extension of the
15 days term is agreed upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is
presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. If the receiver decides not to continue
performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the
fifteen days term, the other party to the contract may be entitled to claim damages, in which case its
claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors.

The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the
authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However,
two exceptions apply:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy
constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and

- intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an
essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the
bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the
company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of
the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy
trustee may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply
to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian
Financial Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de
_la masse)._

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the
period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the
suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension
requires a specific order of the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a
realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and
provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is
necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either
at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to
pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may
suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the
suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the


-----

mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial
instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an
insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such
security shall, in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such
insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on
its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security.
The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules.
The following is a general overview of only the main principles:

- _Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy_
proceedings, the so called “estate debts,” have senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has
contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the
receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder
to the secured creditors.

- _Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured_
asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

- _Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims,_
claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges
on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests.

- _Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of_
security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will
be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank _pari passu (unless a_
creditor agreed to be subordinated).

- Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

**_Subsidiary Guarantee/Collateral_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group
company must fall within the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit
of the Belgian Guarantor and comply with any applicable financial assistance rules. Corporate benefit
is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal
authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or
collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is
only limited case law on this issue.

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case by case basis by reference to the
prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that
the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or
cross stream guarantees and collateral. It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should
be proportionally greater than the risk for the company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement
of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the company should not exceed its
financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is
within the individual group member’s corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met.

Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board
of directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of
directors will be subject to only a “marginal review” by the courts; in insolvency situations, however,
the courts can be expected to take a more critical view.


-----

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable under
civil law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under
criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse
of company goods” (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the
guarantee or security interest could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the
creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest could be held liable if the corporate benefit
requirement is not met and the creditor knew or should have known this. Alternatively, the guarantee
or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit. These rules have
been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct
or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it
is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium.
Accordingly, the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor will be limited accordingly. Including such
limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit.

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company must also be within or serve the corporate
purpose and statutory purpose of the Belgian company as described in its articles of association.

**_Financial Assistance_**

Any guarantee granted by a Belgian Guarantor shall not include and shall not extend to cover any
payment obligation in respect of the proceeds of the New Notes arising out of amounts used to fund
directly or indirectly the acquisition of shares of such Belgian Guarantor to the extent that by assuming
such obligation the Belgian Guarantor would be deemed to be providing prohibited financial assistance
to the acquisition of its own shares or capital participations, as prohibited under Article 5:152 or 7:22
of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations dated March 23, 2019, as amended from time to
time. Therefore, such payment obligations shall be excluded from the concept of guarantee by a Belgian
Guarantor. Any guarantees or security interest granted by a Belgian Guarantor which constitute a breach
of the provisions on financial assistance as defined by Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of
Companies and Associations dated March 23, 2019, as amended from time to time, are not enforceable.

**_Hardening Period and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge
certain transactions that have been concluded or performed by the debtor during the so called “hardening
period.”

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is
deemed to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order
may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on
an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy
order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than
six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its
creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such
decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the
declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte).

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared
ineffective against third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered
into at an undervalue, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for
debts due, and (iv) security interests provided for preexisting debts (save for any security granted during
the suspension period of judicial reorganization proceedings).


-----

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective
against third parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment.

In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared
ineffective against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced or
at an undervalue, (ii) if the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the Belgian
Guarantor’s cessation of payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure preexisting debts.

If the guarantee or security interests granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based
on the above), noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be under an
obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of
the security interests.

Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a Third-party creditor may obtain a court
ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that
the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position
as an existing creditor (actio pauliana).

Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also
be declared ineffective against third parties, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date
of the deed and the date of registration.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be
subject to validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render
such security interests invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to
formalities (e.g. judicial or non-judicial consent) and may be time consuming in the event that the
foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts may condition
the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final
and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement
of security interests and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction
issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts may
require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English documents which they may review.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Some of our Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in
Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of a
Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its “center of main interests” in Germany
(the “German Guarantors”) at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated
in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law (subject to certain exceptions
for particular matters under the EU Insolvency Regulation). Under certain circumstances, insolvency
proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of
companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the center of main interests of
such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the German Guarantors may be
opened in other jurisdictions. See “—European Union.”

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of
the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority
of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority
recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your


-----

ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other
insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event
of over indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when
they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of
its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going
concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a certain forecast horizon
(positive Fortführungsprognose). The forecast horizon is four months for the period until December 31,
2023 and 12 months thereafter, whereby a debtor testing over indebtedness after the end of August 2023
may need to take into account whether over indebtedness occurs immediately after the four months
forecast horizon as a consequence of the then applicable 12 months horizon. If a limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a public limited liability company
(Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any
other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a
situation of illiquidity and/or over indebtedness, the management board or managing director(s) of such
company and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for insolvency without
undue delay but not later than: (i) three weeks after such illiquidity or; (ii) eight weeks (from January
1, 2024: six weeks) after such over-indebtedness occurred or (as the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claim risks as well as
sanction risks under criminal law. A debtor is not considered over indebted even when its liabilities
exceed the value of its assets if, given the circumstances, it is more likely than not that the debtor’s
business can survive as a going concern. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for
the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and_
when they fall due at some point in time within a prognosis period of usually 24 months, whereas
imminent illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for
insolvency proceedings.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over indebted
(Überschuldung) it may also file for preliminary “debtor in possession” moratorium proceedings
(Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a
successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee
(vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable
assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor
enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency
plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor in possession” proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to
enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as
these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation
of the debtor’s business.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event
the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise


-----

the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a
preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the
preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary
administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the
debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings.

Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets
of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter),
whilst in debtor-in-possession proceedings, the debtor’s management retains the right to manage
business. However, the court may also order that certain disposals of the debtor may require the
preliminary trustee’s (vorläufiger Sachwalter) consent also in debtor-in-possession proceedings. The
insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the
debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary
creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the
following three requirements:

(a) a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the
debtor is over indebted);

(b) revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the
financial year preceding the filing; and/or

(c) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis.

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in
the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following:
the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for “debtor in possession” proceedings
(Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung); and appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorläufiger)
_Sachwalter). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if_
certain formal requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity
(if the petition has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebted and (ii) if there are sufficient
assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected
to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings
if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets
(Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has granted debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will
only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor),
upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets,
whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors
(Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency
administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such
change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims)
has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed
individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial.
Individual creditors, or the debtor, can request the insolvency court to remove the insolvency
administrator only on the grounds of a lack of impartiality and only within six months from the
appointment. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings, the
debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s
operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate


-----

(Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor including
the Note Guarantees.

The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to
insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See
“—Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the
_Restructuring Directive”)._

For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings
against the any Guarantor’s subject to the German insolvency regime would include the following:

(a) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right
to administer and dispose of the Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the
(preliminary) insolvency administrator ((vorläufiger) _Insolvenzverwalter) as sole_
representative of the insolvency estate;

(b) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals
effected by the Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings
are null and void by operation of law;

(c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a
security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the
insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the
opening of the insolvency proceedings;

(d) claims against any Guarantors may generally only be pursued in accordance with the
rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

(e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this
person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the
insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of
ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the
insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or
the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene
_Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the_
insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters)
unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements
that are not governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from
the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to
a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to
participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights
they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain
secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is
subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by
a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency
proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may
generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can


-----

instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency
proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient
assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after
insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have
only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case,
secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such
realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains
entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The
insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its
possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable
assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii)
to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen).
According to some voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to
initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as
the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing
to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there is no
authoritative case law on this question. That having been said, the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof) viewed the insolvency administrator competent to realize pledged shares in a
corporation that have been certificated (verbrieft) and are held in a custodian account (Depot) in
Germany in case (i) the shares represent more than 20% in the issued share capital of the pledged
company and (ii) the shareholder rights remain with the debtor. It therefore appears likely that in such
a case, secured creditors would not be held competent to realize the respective share pledges.

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency
administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal
proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory
charges of 9% (or more as agreed upon individually, but in any case at least 4%) for (i) assessing the
value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security
interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts
(“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after
deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary
insolvency administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members
of the creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among
the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the extent not satisfied
after enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes). If a German Guarantor or a subsidiary subject
to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of
the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security
(however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of
the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to
satisfy the obligations under the Notes by the German Guarantors after such secured creditors have been
satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it
may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are
distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in
an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator
or, in debtor-in-possession proceedings, by the trustee (upon instruction of the preliminary creditors’
committee or the creditors’ meeting) and which requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well
as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. The insolvency court
may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain conditions (cramdown) in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) under certain conditions. The insolvency plan


-----

(Insolvenzplan) may also derogate from other provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). In particular, it may contain provisions regarding the discharge of secured and
unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create,
modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is
a corporate entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the partnership interests in the debtor can also be
included in the insolvency plan, including an issuance of shares or partnership interests to third parties
or to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain
circumstances provide for provisions, inter alia, regarding the Notes or the Note Guarantees or the
Collateral which are less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the provisions of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the release of the Collateral or the release of obligations
under the Notes or the Note Guarantees. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a
debt to equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into
a debt to equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt to equity swap. An insolvency plan can
further provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other security interests provided by
debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor affiliates being required to
become subject of the debtor’s or separate insolvency proceedings, provided that the relevant debtor
affiliate consents to the impairment. Creditors affected by such impairment are entitled to receive
adequate compensation. This means that the claims under the Note Guarantees can get impaired if the
Issuer or a Guarantor would enter into German insolvency proceedings, regardless of whether or not
the relevant Guarantor is itself subject of insolvency proceedings.

Under certain conditions, the debtor may also file for protective shield proceedings
(Schutzschirmverfahren). In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit
enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other
preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for up to three months if an
independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile
(offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an
insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept
under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among
the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with
separately. As a general principle, the claims arising from a guarantee may be enforced against a
German Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer. However, the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) has provisions to facilitate the coordination of and
cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. Whereas these provisions do not
provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a
consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, they stipulate four key measures in order to facilitate an efficient
administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group
company insolvency proceedings (Gruppengerichtsstand); (ii) a single person may be appointed as
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) for all relevant group companies; (iii) certain
coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’
committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the
ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court
(Koordinationsgericht).

As a general principle, the claims arising from the Note Guarantees may be enforced against a Guarantor
outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the relevant Guarantor. Any insolvency
proceedings over the assets of a Guarantor would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall
financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may
cause other Guarantors or other affiliated companies to subsequently file for insolvency.


-----

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law
(including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor
for the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the
covenants and undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the Trustee
being considered in a “shareholder like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an
insolvency proceeding over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims arising from a Guarantee
would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen).
Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the
assets of a German Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special
permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast
majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of
the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the
claims of regular, unsecured creditors.

The Act for the Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate the
Consequences of Crises, which was adopted in March 27, 2020 (as amended from time to time,
originally the “COVInsAG” and now the “SanInsKG”) suspends, inter alia, the statutory subordination
of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied
for by September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans: (i) that were granted between March
1, 2020 and September 30, 2020; or (ii) were granted between October 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020
if the debtor was overindebted but not illiquid; or (iii) were granted between January 1, 2021 and April
30, 2021 if the debtor had submitted an application for applicable German state aid between 1 November
2020 and 28 February 2021 (or, if an application was not possible due to legal or actual reasons, and
the debtor was otherwise eligible for the applicable German state aid) unless there were no reasonable
prospects to receive the applicable German state aid or if receiving the applicable German state aid
would not have been sufficient to prevent insolvency.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be
effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become
unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

**_Preventive restructuring framework_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG). In transforming the EU directive 2019/1023 of the
European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on
discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures
concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132
(Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on June
26, 2019 into national law, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has come into
force on January 1, 2021 in Germany. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for
a new pre-insolvency procedure to restructure the liabilities of debtors, whose “centre of main interest”
is located in Germany. This may apply as of the date of this offering memorandum to certain of the
Guarantors as well as to the Issuer. As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has
only come into force on January 1, 2021, little corresponding (court) practice exists as of the date of
this offering memorandum and consequently any proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and
Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come with uncertainty. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant
consequences of an initiation of restructuring proceedings by a Relevant German Entity having its
“centre of main interest” in Germany would be in particular the following:

- potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings;

- any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the
restructuring plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Notes)


-----

with a majority of 75% of the claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down by other
classes under certain presumptions;

- any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to
restructuring proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral;
and

- restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims,
or, if applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a
moratorium.

_Restructuring proceedings_

Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the
competent restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible
to file for restructuring proceedings if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig).
Such imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more likely than not that the
debtor will be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due within a two years’ look-forward period.

During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business manager,
which includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular, the debtor
has to refrain from any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the restructuring
goal (Restrukturierungsziel). This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be subject to the
envisaged restructuring plan, must not be settled or collateralized during the restructuring proceedings.

During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor
becomes illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However,
if such an insolvency event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly
without undue delay. The restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in the
restructuring court’s discretion, (i) the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the
backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all creditors
or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over- indebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused by the
enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to the restructuring plan provided the
achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains predominantly likely. Once
restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor is again obliged to
file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

If (i) the envisaged restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium
enterprises or respective collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a
moratorium against all or essentially all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for
specific supervision of the settlement of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to appoint
a mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A mandatory restructuring officer is
also to be appointed by the restructuring court if the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) can
predictably only be achieved by a cram-down of dissenting classes (unless only claims originated by
financial institutions and/ or shareholders are to be compromised).

The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter)
any person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is suitable for the respective
individual case and who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or has comparable
qualifications (an “Eligible Restructuring Officer”); the court may take suggestions by the debtor,
creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is, based on expert opinion provided by an
Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see “—Moratorium”), or (ii) creditors of one
class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose a mandatory restructuring
officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different from the proposed
Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is evidently inadequate. If
a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the debtor or a group of


-----

creditors, the restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory restructuring officer in its own
discretion.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the
procedure to be elected for the voting on the restructuring plan and can be empowered by the
restructuring court to (i) supervise the debtor’s board and business situation and (ii) receive payments
to and approve payments made by the debtor. If a moratorium is granted, the mandatory restructuring
officer is obliged to monitor that the respective prerequisites of such moratorium persist and, in case
such prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file for a lifting of such moratorium. Additionally, the
mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the proposed plan’s prospects to remove the
debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and restore the debtor’s viability.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties
independently and the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory
restructuring officer.

The restructuring court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from office for good cause ex
officio or, if the mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted
independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition.

Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of an
optional restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan.
Creditors may only request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the costs
of the optional restructuring officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support the
stakeholders involved in the negotiations of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An
optional restructuring officer can also be removed from office by the restructuring court ex officio for
good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a
creditor’s petition.

Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may terminate
the restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g., if the debtor notifies the restructuring court of
the occurrence of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking into account
the actual status of the relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings is obviously not in the interest of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor files for
insolvency or insolvency proceedings are opened over the assets of the debtor based on a creditor’s
filing.

_Restructuring plan_

Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan, which can comprise certain
selected or all (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on
intentionally committed acts of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of financial and other
agreements to which more than the debtor and one other party are parties, including the terms and
liabilities relating to the relevant debtor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and undue
claims, and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and intercreditor
agreements can be amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by debtor affiliates
(gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted under a restructuring plan,
provided that affected creditors are adequately compensated. Consequently, the Notes or the Note
Guarantees could also be subject to a restructuring plan provided the respective debtor has its “centre
of main interest” in Germany.

Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law
measures like a share-capital increase. Debt-to-equity swaps can be implemented without the


-----

shareholders’ consent but require the willingness of at least certain creditors to equitize their debt claims
as no creditor can be forced to take equity as a consideration under a restructuring plan. Hence, if, the
Notes or the Note Guarantees were subject to a restructuring plan providing for debt-to-equity swap,
single holders of the Notes could not be forced under the restructuring plan to take equity in the Issuer
or a Guarantor without their respective consent.

The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed
by the restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a
(virtual) creditors’ meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the
respective creditors’ economic interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors,
unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors
(e.g., shareholders) will form separate classes. However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings,
could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by value of all claims of one class will be
required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity requirement. Dissenting classes can
be crammed down (or up), if

- the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the plan than absent the plan
(whereby the alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent liquidation, but
can also be an alternative out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis);

- the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value
created by the plan; and

- a majority of classes has accepted the plan.

A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan if
(i) no other creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that would rank junior in
insolvency proceedings, the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through the plan which is not
covered by a respective stakeholder’s contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor that would rank pari
_passu in insolvency proceedings receives a preferential treatment compared to the dissenting class under_
the restructuring plan (unless such preferential treatment is appropriate (sachgerecht) in light of the
individual situation of distress to overcome and the dissenting class accounts for no more than 50% of
the rank’s total claims). However, despite the prerequisite described under (ii) in the foregoing sentence,
a creditor class can also be crammed down in case a shareholder retains equity without any additional
contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and bindingly committed to the continuation of the
debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or the creditors’ rights are only
compromised marginally (e.g., by a maturity extension of no more than 18 months).

Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan.
In case the voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected
stakeholders before the plan can be confirmed.

The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid
(drohend zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the
procedure to adopt the restructuring plan or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured upon
the restructuring court’s notice, (iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan can
obviously be not satisfied by the debtor or (iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the
restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring concept is incoherent or appears to be based on incorrect
facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success. Additionally, dissenting creditors can request the
restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the applicant will be expectedly worse off under
the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan and the applicant has already raised
such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable. However, such application
has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors that can prove to
be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such funds.


-----

Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they
are able to produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the
restructuring plan and funds provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not
suffice for their individual compensation. Such appeal will only have suspensive effect (aufschiebende
_Wirkung) against the effectiveness of the restructuring plan if requested by the dissenting creditor and_
ordered by the court based on serious and irreversible disadvantages for such dissenting creditor that
are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate implementation of the restructuring plan.

Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a
German restructuring court in accordance with the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act
(StaRUG) are included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings
Regulation (as amended) and will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency
Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and
regulations under applicable international private law. As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring
Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, any such recognition has not to our
knowledge been tested as of the date of this offering memorandum.

_Moratorium_

In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by
the competent court upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain
or all creditors with regards to their payment claims or the realization of respective collateral over
moveable assets. The moratorium can initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three months,
with subsequent orders to extend the moratorium up to a maximum of eight months permissible under
certain conditions. Such moratorium may also be sanctioned with regards to collateral provided by the
debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten). The moratorium does not suspend the relevant
creditor’s interest claims. However, whereas creditors may still file an insolvency petition against the
debtor during a moratorium, correspondingly initiated insolvency proceedings are suspended for the
time of the moratorium. Under certain conditions, in particular if the requirements to terminate
restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not comply with certain statutory duties under the
Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) the competent court may lift the moratorium,
also on a creditor’s application.

_Limitations on Enforcement_

Some of the German Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—“GmbH”) and/or a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—
_“AG”) and/or European company (Europäische Gesellschaft, “SE”) incorporated under German law._
Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies is
subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die
_Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”), the German Stock Corporation Act_
(Aktiengesetz, “AktG”) and other laws. These provisions would also apply to any future German
Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g.,
GmbH & Co. KG), AG or SE.

_GmbH Limitation Language_

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s
net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves as determined under German generally
accepted accounting principles) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital
(Stammkapital); in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, such provisions apply to the general partner which is a
GmbH. The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH or GmbH & Co.
KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be
considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries


-----

to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister
company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures,
credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to
subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner
incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the
guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the
guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such
enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable
partner, such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net
assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further
reduced. Accordingly, the Guarantee, the Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents provided
by the German Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore
the enforcement of the Note Guarantees, the Indenture and the Collateral is limited in the manner
described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the
relevant German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

_AG Limitation Language_

As a general rule, Section 57 AktG prohibits the disbursement of the deposits to the stockholders
(Verbot der Einlagenrückgewähr). In addition, pursuant to Section 71a AktG the relevant German AG
or SE may not grant any loan or grant and security to a third party for purposes of the acquisition of the
stock in such AG or SE. Any agreement in such respect is void.

Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to
secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Section 57
AktG and/or Section 71a AktG, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements,
guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the
legal form of a German AG or SE. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the
guarantees or the security interests agree to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the
German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of Section 57
AktG and/or Section 71a AktG. Accordingly, the Guarantee, the Indenture and the Transaction Security
Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors contains or will contain,
respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Note Guarantees and the
Indenture is limited in the manner described below. This could lead to a situation in which the respective
guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. See also
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure —Corporate benefit, financial assistance
_laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may_
_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

and any AG Guarantor shall have a defence (Einrede) against any Limited
Upstream Obligation of such AG Guarantor or of any Guarantor that is a
subsidiary of such AG Guarantor.

(ii) Any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by such AG Guarantor or by any

transfer agreements) exists between the relevant AG Guarantor whose
obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation as
dominating company (herrschendes Unternehmen) and the relevant AG
Guarantor as a dominated company (beherrschtes Unternehmen), provided
that:

(A) the AG Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the [Issuer or the relevant

in each case unless

(C) the mere existence of such a DPLA between the relevant AG
Guarantor and a direct shareholder (with the direct shareholder as
dominating party) does not lead to the inapplicability of § 57 (1) and §
71a AktG (in connection with § 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE
Regulation, as applicable) as explicitly confirmed with reasons (and
not, for example, as an obiter dictum) by the Federal Court of Justice

(D) the loss compensation claim (Verlustausgleichsanspruch) of the AG
Guarantor under the DPLA would not be, or cannot be expected to be,
fully valuable and recoverable (vollwertig) in the balance sheet of the
AG Guarantor.

(iii) Any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by such AG Guarantor or by any
Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to
the extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is covered (gedeckt) by a fully
valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger
_Gegenleistungs- oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the AG Guarantor against the_
affiliate whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream
Obligation and would therefore not lead to a violation of § 57 (1) AktG (in


-----

connection with § 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation, as applicable), in
each case unless it would lead to a violation of § 71a AktG.

(iv) Any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by such AG Guarantor or by any
Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to
the extent:

(A) an amount utilized under the Indenture is applied for the repayment,
prepayment or other refinancing of any Financial Indebtedness of such
AG Guarantor or Subsidiary of such AG Guarantor; and

(in connection with § 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation, as
applicable).

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, the limits set out in this paragraph (b) shall no
further apply from the date the relevant AG Guarantor is no longer
incorporated as an AG unless such Guarantor is a Subsidiary of another AG
Guarantor in which case this paragraph (b) shall apply in a way that the relevant
Guarantor shall be treated as a Subsidiary of that other AG Guarantor in
accordance with this paragraph (b). In such event, the limitations set out in this
paragraph (b) shall not apply to the Limited Upstream Obligation granted by
that Guarantor in respect of any liabilities which are owed by that other AG
Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) _GmbH Guarantee Limitation Language_

(i) Save as set out in this paragraph (c), the Trustee shall not enforce, and any
GmbH Guarantor (and/or the relevant subsidiary of a GmbH Guarantor) shall
have a defence (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to
the extent a discharge (Erfüllung) or enforcement (Vollstreckung) in respect of
a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment to
occur.

(ii) The restrictions in paragraph (i) shall not apply:

(A) if and to the extent the Limited Upstream Obligation of the GmbH
Guarantor secures any indebtedness under any Notes Document in
respect of:

(1) amounts which are (directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise
passed on to the relevant GmbH Guarantor or its Subsidiaries; or

(2) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit
of any of the creditors of the GmbH Guarantor or the GmbH
Guarantor's Subsidiaries,

in each case, to the extent that any such on-lending or otherwise
passing on or bank guarantees or letters of credit are still outstanding
at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Limited Upstream
Obligation; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (ii)
shall have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced
multiple times (no double dip);

(B) if, at the time of enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation, a
DPLA (either directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of
domination and/or profit transfer agreements) exists between the


-----

[Issuer or the relevant Guarantors] whose obligations are secured by
the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation as dominating company
(herrschendes Unternehmen) and the relevant GmbH Guarantor as a
dominated company (beherrschtes Unternehmen), provided that:

(1) the GmbH Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the [Issuer or the relevant
Guarantors] whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited
Upstream Obligation; or

(2) the GmbH Guarantor and the [Issuer or the relevant Guarantors]
whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream
Obligation are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect)
parent company with such parent company as dominating entity
(beherrschendes Unternehmen),

in each case unless the mere existence of such DPLA does not lead to
the inapplicability of § 30 (1) sentence 1 GmbHG;

(C) if and to the extent any payment under the Limited Upstream
Obligation is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable
consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder
_Rückgewähranspruch) of the GmbH Guarantor against the [Issuer or_
the relevant Guarantors] whose obligations are secured by the relevant
Limited Upstream Obligation; or

(D) if the relevant GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations
pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below; however,
if and to the extent that the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation has
been enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this
paragraph (c) because the Management Notification and/or the
Auditor's Determination has not (or not in a timely manner) been
delivered pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below,
but the Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within four
months from its due date in accordance with paragraphs (iv) below,
the Trustee shall upon demand of the GmbH Guarantor to the Trustee
repay any amount received from the GmbH Guarantor which pursuant
to the Auditor's Determination would not have been available for
enforcement, if the Auditor's Determination had been delivered in a
timely manner.

(iii) If the relevant GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the making of a demand against that GmbH Guarantor
under the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation:

(A) to what extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is an upstream or
cross-stream guarantee or indemnity; and

(B) to what extent a GmbH Capital Impairment would occur as a result of
an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation (setting out in
reasonable detail the amount of its GmbH Net Assets, providing an upto-date pro forma balance sheet),

then the restrictions set out in paragraph (i) above shall cease to apply until a
Management Notification has been provided.


-----

(iv) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within
twenty (20) Business Days of its receipt, request the relevant GmbH Guarantor
to provide to the Trustee within forty-five (45) Business Days of receipt of
such request a determination by the Auditors or any other auditors of
international standard and reputation appointed by the GmbH Guarantor (at its
own cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail the amount in which the
payment and/or enforcement under the Limited Upstream Obligation would
cause a GmbH Capital Impairment subject to the terms set out under this
paragraph (c). Save for manifest errors, the Auditor's Determination shall be
binding on all parties.

(v) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor's Determination which prevented
it from demanding any or only partial payment under the Limited Upstream
Obligation, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial conditions of
the GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor's Determination has substantially
improved, the Trustee (acting reasonably) may, at the GmbH Guarantor's cost
and expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the
GmbH Guarantor by applying the same principles that were used for the
preparation of the Auditor's Determination by the auditors who prepared the
Auditor's Determination in order for such Auditors to determine whether (and,
if so, to what extent) the GmbH Capital Impairment has been cured as result of
the improvement of the financial condition of the GmbH Guarantor. The
Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor's Determination prior
to the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding
Auditor's Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the
Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent the Auditors determine that the
GmbH Capital Impairment have been cured.

(vi) The GmbH Net Assets shall be adjusted as follows:

(A) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the
relevant GmbH Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant
GmbH Guarantor became a party to this Agreement and made from
retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be
deducted from the amount of the registered share capital
(Stammkapital) of the relevant GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly
prohibited under the Notes Documents and has been carried out
without the prior written consent of the Trustee;

(B) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 253 (6) HGB
shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

(C) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 268 (8) HGB
shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

(D) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 272 (5) HGB
shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; and

(E) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant GmbH Guarantor in
willful or grossly negligent violation of the Notes Documents shall not
be taken into account as liabilities.

(vii) Where a GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this
paragraph (c) that the Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it
shall realize, to the extent lawful and within reasonable opinion commercially
justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a


-----

book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the
assets and are not necessary for the relevant GmbH Guarantor's business (nicht
_betriebsnotwendig)._

(c) _Liquidity Impairment Limitation Language_

(i) Save as set out in this paragraph (d), the Trustee shall not enforce, and any
German Guarantor shall have a defence (Einrede) against, any Limited
Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a payment and/or enforcement in
respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a Liquidity Impairment
for such German Guarantor.

(ii) Paragraphs (c)(iii), (c)(v), (c)(iv) and (c)(vii) above (including the repayment
contemplated in (c)(ii)(D) above) shall apply _mutatis mutandis to the_
restriction in paragraph (i) above.

(d) Where the provisions of this Clause apply to a limited partnership
(Kommanditgesellschaft), all references to the assets of a German Guarantor shall
_mutatis mutandis include a reference to the assets of the general partner_
(Komplementär) of such limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).

(e) In addition to the restrictions set out in paragraphs (b) through (e) above, if a German
Guarantor demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal
Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals
(Oberlandesgericht), the payment under and/or enforcement of any Limited Upstream
Obligation against such German Guarantor would result in personal liability of its
managing director(s) (Geschäftsführer) or director(s) (Vorstände) for a reimbursement
of payments made under any Limited Upstream Obligation (including, without
limitation, pursuant to §30, 31, 43 GmbHG, §15 InsO, § 93 AktG and/or § 826 BGB),
the German Guarantor shall have a defence (Einrede) against the Limited Upstream
Obligation to the extent required in order not to incur such liability.

(f) For the _avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Limited Upstream_
Obligation granted by a German Guarantor or of any subsidiary of a German Guarantor
in respect of any borrowing liabilities which are owed by German Guarantor or any of
its subsidiaries shall not be limited under this Clause.

(g) The restrictions set out in this Clause do not affect the rights of the Trustee to claim
any outstanding amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent the restrictions
set out in this Clause would allow such claim at that later point in time.

(h) _Nothing in this Clause shall prevent the Trustee or a German Guarantor from claiming_
in court that payments under and/or an enforcement of the Limited Upstream
Obligations do or do not fall within the scope of §§ 30, 31, 43 GmbHG, §§ 57, 71a, 93,
278 (3) AktG, § 15b (5) InsO, Art. 5 SE Regulation and/or § 826 BGB (as applicable).

(i) Nothing in this Clause shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under
the Indenture or any other Notes Document to the Trustee or any Noteholder or vice
_versa._

(j) Each _reference in this Clause to a statutory provision shall be construed to be a_
reference to the relevant equivalent statutory provision (if any) as amended, re-enacted
or replaced from time to time.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, this Clause and any rights
and/or obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, German law.”

_General Comments regarding German Limitation Language_

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with
respect to Sections 30, 31 GmbHG, Section 15(b) InsO and Sections 57, 71a AktG), are subject to
evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of
shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of, as applicable, an AG, a SE, a GmbH
or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors to make
payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees or the enforceability of the Note Guarantees, the
Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents relating to the Collateral (i.e., the share pledges and
any other security interest) provided by the German Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a
situation in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own
payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or other
collateral granted by the German Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in
an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious
inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor
and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of
its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with
respect to the granting of the Guarantee or any Collateral by the German Guarantors.

The enforcement of security granted by a German Guarantor may also be excluded (entirely) in case
the granting or enforcement of such security and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence of a claim
by any so secured finance party under such security resulted or would result in any personal liability of
the relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to Section 15(b) InsO.

Furthermore the beneficiary (for example, a holder of Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment
of the stated share capital of the grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (for example,
the provision or the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally
liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled
that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally
influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos
mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware
of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close
to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s
(impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time
such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with
the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of
the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary
of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the
guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with
respect thereto.

_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the
secured claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated,


-----

and may not be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the
relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be
party to the Transaction Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to
time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the creation of the parallel debt,
the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable by each
obligor under, in particular, the Notes. The pledges governed by German law will directly and
exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt rather than the obligations
under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the
pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt has not been tested under German law,
and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German
law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition,
holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure.”

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the
sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which
certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the
security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the
entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the
collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority
(according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset
constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay
on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

_Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the_
_Restructuring Directive_

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or in the event
that debtor in possession status has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge
(anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors
and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance
periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the
circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten year period prior to the filing of the petition for
commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings, which would be based on and governed by the insolvency laws
of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as the granting of collateral
for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by
an insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, trustee under the rules of avoidance as set forth in
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes or
any collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Notes may not be able
to recover any amounts under the Notes or the relevant collateral. If payments have already been made
under the Notes or collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would
have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Notes would only have a general
unsecured claim under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the
provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases,:

(a) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain,
security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act
was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)


-----

at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or
(ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the
creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of
circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing); whereby in each case
an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or
of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(b) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain,
security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which
such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or
at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i)
such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken
during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was
illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior
to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor
knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other
insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest
such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to
have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for the other creditors;

(c) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or
by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a
proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was
entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the
commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of
such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such
time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s
illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; in each case an “affiliated party”
(nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of
the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(d) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants
security (including a guarantee) for a third party debt, which might be regarded as
having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years
prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings;

(e) any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition
for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with
the intent to prejudice the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such
intention at the time of such act, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary
knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction disadvantaged
the other creditors. For granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency
creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, such
knowledge is (solely) presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) (as opposed to the knowledge of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in regular cases) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other_
creditors. Apart from that, such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an
insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung)
(whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which
such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), may only be avoided if they
were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement
of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing. There is a rebuttable presumption
that, if the debtor reached a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the


-----

creditor or the creditor granted any other form of deferred payment
(Zahlungserleichterungen) to the debtor, he had no knowledge of the debtor’s
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at the time of the transaction;

(f) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and
an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of
the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two
years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as
of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘related
party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or
supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the
debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give
them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other
persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing
persons;

(g) any act that provides security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or an economically similar
claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten
years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings
or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place
during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation
for shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the
shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful
restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during
over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring
the debtor; and

(h) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically
equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior
to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter
and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or
surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate
the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a German Guarantor) was unable to pay its
debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed,
or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be.
Knowledge of pending restructuring proceedings (see—“Preventive Restructuring Framework”) per se
does not suffice for a creditor to be deemed to have such “knowledge”. A person is further deemed to
have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s
imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted
an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee)
(Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was
entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminent
illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual
illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If an insolvency creditor concluded a payment
agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred payment terms
(Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor
did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to a “related
party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” Any amounts obtained
from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.


-----

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor who has obtained
an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims
by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as
the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Avoidance Act
(Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Avoidance Act differ to a certain
extent from the above described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods
are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

The provision of a security concurrently with the incurrence of debt funded as new money may be
qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged. Meaning, under certain circumstances
it may not be subject to avoidance rights under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg).
According to recent caselaw of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however, this
privilege does not apply to claims under a shareholder loan agreement or economically equivalent
transactions as described above.

Furthermore, any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan (see —“Preventive Restructuring
_Framework”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige_
_Sanierung) of the debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete_
information presented by the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof.
This privilege does not apply to shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral
provided therefor.

Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the
insolvency estate.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable towards another creditor if (i) such creditor was
aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending)
insolvency (for which knowledge of pendent restructuring proceedings (see —“Preventive
_Restructuring Framework”) per se does not suffice) at the time such funding was provided or extended_
or such security was granted and (ii) the other creditor suffered losses caused by a delayed filing for
insolvency based on the additional or extended existing funding. The German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, e.g., the creditor was to act with the intention of
detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal
principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the
transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or
security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.
If, however, such was additional funding has been provided or existing funding has been extended or
respective collateral has been granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain cases,
until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021), any such transaction is statutorily exempted from the lender
liability concept as laid out above.

**_Satisfaction of subordinated claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against
the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be
satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according
to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued
on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings;
(ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii)
fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal
consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to
the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder
loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic
terms to such a loan. However, the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from


-----

economically similar acts is suspended in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30,
2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in
certain cases, if the debtor fulfilled the respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing
duties at the time, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021).

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated
on or about the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers,
and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the entire principal amount
of the Notes. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes which it has
agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial
Purchasers may be increased or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to offer the Notes initially at the offering price
listed on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers
may change the offering price and any other selling terms of the Notes at any time without notice. The
Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates or through registered
broker dealers, including in respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any Initial
Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of Notes in the United
States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by
guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Depending on market
conditions, certain of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the
Notes for their own accounts. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify
offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. The Issuer has also agreed
to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to
make in respect of those liabilities.

The Sponsor or its affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Notes at a purchase
price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, subject
to a pass through of the Initial Purchasers’ discount (ignoring any credit) in respect of the Notes
purchased by such persons.

Investment funds advised by entities affiliated with the Sponsor may purchase Notes in the Offering at
a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering
Memorandum, and in the case of investment funds registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), subject to the 1940 Act. The Purchase Agreement between the
Issuer and the Initial Purchasers will not restrict the ability of the funds and the affiliates of the Sponsor
to buy or sell the Notes in the future and, as a result, these investment funds and affiliates of the Sponsor
may buy or sell Notes in open market transactions at any time following the consummation of the
Offering.

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that
are substantially similar to the Notes and having a tenor of more than one year during the period from
the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 45 days after the closing of
the Offering.


-----

**New Issue of Notes**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange; however, there can be
no assurance that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after
completion of this Offering as permitted by applicable law. However, the Initial Purchasers are under
no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market making activities at any time without notice. In
addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop,
or that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time
or at a price which will be favorable to you, if at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
_Our Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to_
_sell the Notes will be limited.”_

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase
and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, stabilizing
transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess
of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions
involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining
the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open
market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit
the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally
sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.
These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise.

These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result,
the price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In
addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither
we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these
transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any
stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of
this Offering is made and, if begun, may be discontinued at any time, but it must end no later than the
earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. Any
stabilization action or over allotment must be conducted by the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting
on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.

**Initial Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or around the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be        Business Days
following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+     ”).
Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two Business Days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the        succeeding Business Days
will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+    , to specify an
alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of
the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own adviser.


-----

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial
Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide
in the future investment banking, financial advisory, operational support and commercial banking
services to the Issuer and its subsidiaries and affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they
have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. J.P. Morgan SE and/or certain of their
affiliates advised the Sellers in connection with the Acquisition. In addition, in the ordinary course of
their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer (including
the Notes), the Guarantors or their respective subsidiaries and/or affiliates. Depending on market
conditions, one or more of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase a portion of the Notes
for their own accounts, which could affect future trading of the Notes. Such Initial Purchaser or Initial
Purchasers may in the future resell all or a portion of such Notes from time to time.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may, in the future, act as hedge counterparties
to the Issuer and its subsidiaries consistent with their customary risk management policies, and will
receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and/or
their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the
Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial
Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have received, and expect to receive, customary
fees and commissions for these transactions.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or certain of their affiliates are lenders or holders of certain local
lines, bank loans or other debt of the Group. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” The Initial
Purchasers and/or their affiliates are also lenders and/or arrangers under the Senior Term Facilities,
Second Lien Facility and the Bridge Facility and J.P. Morgan acts as Agent under the Senior Term
Facilities and the Bridge Facility. As a result, affiliates of the Initial Purchasers will receive a portion
of the proceeds of the Offering in connection with the partial repayment of the Bridge Facility. See
“Use of Proceeds.”

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer_
_of any of the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof (together, the “Securities”) have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act, any U.S. state securities laws, or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless the Securities
are registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the

Securities are being offered and sold only (i) to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A,
“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) outside the United States in an offshore transaction (in each
case, as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S. Accordingly, we are offering and selling
the Securities to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

- in the United States to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in
Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Securities hereunder (other than each of the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to
have acknowledged, represented, warranted and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows
(terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A and Regulation S are used herein as defined

transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

(2) it is either (a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of these Securities to it will be made in reliance
on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for
the account of another QIB, or (b) it is purchasing the Securities outside the United States in an
offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S;

(3) it acknowledges that neither the Issuer, the Guarantors nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing any of the foregoing, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the
offer or sale of any Securities, other than the information contained in or incorporated by
reference in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to
it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities.
It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as it
has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities,
including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial
Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the
Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of
this Offering Memorandum or the information incorporated by reference herein;

(4) it is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for an account with respect to which it
exercises sole investment discretion and for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each
case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any

distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any state or other securities laws, subject
to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor
account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to
resell such Securities to a QIB pursuant to Rule 144A, outside the United States pursuant to
Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the Securities Act, or in
any transaction not subject to the Securities Act;

(5) it understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it
is purchasing the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its acceptance
thereof will be deemed to agree, that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise
transfer any Securities or any beneficial interests in any Securities, it will do so prior to the date
which is, in the case of Securities offered to QIBs pursuant to Rule 144A, one year after the
later of the original issue date of such Securities, the original issue date of the issuance of any
additional securities and the last date on which the issuer or any affiliate of the issuer was the
owner of such Security (or any predecessor of such Security) only (a) to the Issuer, the
Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been
declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as such Security is eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own
account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in
reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States to
a non-U.S. person outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S or (e) pursuant to
any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject
in each of the foregoing cases to compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any
applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s right
prior to any such offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (e) to require that a certificate of
transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the Security is completed and delivered by the
transferor to the Trustee.

(6) it understands that the Securities will bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE

TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE
ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM,
OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT.

BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF, THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY (1) REPRESENTS THAT
(A) IT IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE
U.S. SECURITIES ACT) (“QIB”) OR (B) IT IS ACQUIRING THIS SECURITY OUTSIDE THE
UNITED STATES IN AN “OFFSHORE TRANSACTION” (AS DEFINED IN REGULATION S
UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT), (2) AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF
OF ANY INVESTOR FOR WHICH IT HAS PURCHASED SECURITIES TO OFFER, SELL OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS SECURITY OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THIS SECURITY,
PRIOR TO THE DATE WHICH IS ONE YEAR AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE
DATE OF SUCH SECURITIES, THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE OF THE ISSUANCE OF ANY
ADDITIONAL SECURITIES AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY
AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF SUCH SECURITY (OR ANY
PREDECESSOR OF SUCH SECURITY) ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER, THE GUARANTORS OR

Acquisition related costs

The total acquisition-related costs related to these acquisitions amount to EUR 4,11 million. All these costs
have been expensed within the income statement at the acquisition date.

#### 3.1.2 Acquisitions in the prior year

Please refer to the full year 2021 financial statements for an overview of the acquisitions done in 2021.

#### 3.2 Acquisitions of joint ventures and associates

In May 2022 ETA, a subsidiary of the Abylsen group, established a joint venture with DFI, which is a
subcontractor ETA works with on specific projects. ETA holds 50% of the shares for an amount of EUR
0,03 million. The purpose of this investment is to reduce the amount of insurance expenses of the projects
ETA and DFI are working on. No activity is planned in this joint venture until 2023.
The Group acquired 3,6% additional shares in Happy Recruiter. Following this transaction the Group holds
38,6% of the shares in Happy Recruiter.

Please refer to the full year 2021 financial statements for an overview of the acquisitions of joint ventures
and associates done in 2021.

#### 3.3 Acquisition of non-controlling interest

On 23 June 2022 Newco Abylsen acquired 35,07% additional shares in Newco Greenworking for a price
of EUR 9,83 million. Following this transaction Newco Abylsen holds 95,07% of the shares in Newco
Greenworking.

Please refer to the full year 2021 financial statements for an overview of the transactions with noncontrolling interests in 2021.

Changes in the non-controlling interests in the Group’s ownership interest after control is obtained, that do
not result in a change in control of the subsidiary, have been accounted for within equity. Therefore, no
gain or loss in the income statement on selling the subsidiary’s shares has been recognized, neither any
additional goodwill has been reflected when acquiring additional shares. Instead, the carrying amount of
the non-controlling interest has been adjusted to reflect the change in the ownership interest in the
subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the
fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in equity and attributed to the Group’s equity
holders.

### 4 Financial risk management

 Fair value estimation

The majority of financial assets and liabilities are classified as assets/liabilities at amortized cost, except
for derivatives which are measured at the fair value through profit or loss. Borrowings are recognized
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently carried at amortized cost, for
which any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
The Group does not hold material financial instruments at fair value.

The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured or disclosed at fair value
at 30 September 2022 and 31 December 2021:

The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to
approximate their fair values.

The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future
contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial
instruments. For most of the borrowings, the fair values are not materially different to their carrying amounts
since the interest payable on those borrowings is either close to current market rates or the borrowings are
of a short-term nature. The difference in the above table for the bank loans is due to paid transaction costs
and the derivative financial asset that are reflected in the net book value, under the amortized cost method.


-----

### 5 Management judgements and estimates

Preparing interim financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires management to make judgements
and estimates and to use assumptions that may significantly influence the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the notes on contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. We refer to our annual report 2021.

### 6 Seasonality

The Group’s revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations in many of the markets where they operate. The
Group has in the past experienced and expects in the future to experience fluctuations in the results of
operations due to seasonal demand in their current markets. Seasonality means that the Group’s results
vary from quarter to quarter, and therefore the results of one quarter may not be indicative of results for
the full year. Seasonality varies depending on a number of different factors, including the business units,
the operating segments, the underlying industry sector served, including delays in the construction industry
due to weather or otherwise, the nature of any seasonal work during a specific period, such as the weeks
before Christmas and Easter, as well as around harvest time in the food production sector or around
holiday periods, including Christmas and summer holidays. Historically, revenue fluctuates, with higher
levels of revenue typically being received in the second half of the year just after summer holidays with an
additional decrease in December due to Christmas holidays. Due to this seasonality effect, the Group does
not expect their Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements to be reflective of the results they
anticipate for the year ending December 31, 2022.


-----

### 7 Segment reporting

As from 2021 the Group only presents two segments (instead of three previously) to reflect the integration
of the General and Specialized Staffing segments into the Specialized Talent Solutions segment which
occurred in the course of Q1 2021. This integration has been materialized through the successful
completion of the partial merger between TimePartner and Zaquensis in Q2 2021. This segment reporting
also reflects better the strategy of House of HR towards becoming even more specialized in the Human
Resources solutions market. The final purpose of this segmentation is to better focus on how to attract
candidates and present the services to our client base.

- **Specialized Talent Solutions: The Specialized Talent Solutions segment provides on the one hand**
temporary staffing solutions with a focus on ‘temp-to-perm’ placements, international job candidate
recruiting and permanent placements for clients who need specific job profiles, and on the other hand
(mostly) short-term staffing solutions to larger clients with multiple staffing needs.

- **Engineering & Consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving sectors**
like energy, pharmaceuticals, technology etc. The Group also assists clients with the search and
selection of the right candidate, interim management or secondment.

Corporate management is responsible for managing performance, underlying risks, and effectiveness of
operations.

The table below shows the segment information provided to the strategic steering committee for the
reportable segments for the first nine months ended 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2021 and the
basis on which revenue is recognized.


-----

Segment balance sheet and segment income statement are presented before elimination of intersegment
transactions. Sales between segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions
with third parties.
The group eliminations for the nine months ended 30 September 2022 contain the LTIP expenses of EUR
3,54 million (refer to the equity roll-forward table and note 21), the elimination of EUR 24,98 million dividend
paid by Accent Construct to House of HR and the elimination of EUR 10,00 million dividend paid by
Redmore Group to House of HR.
The group eliminations for the nine months ended 30 September 2021 contain the LTIP expense of EUR
1,21 million (refer to the equity roll and note 21), the elimination of EUR 1,04 million dividend paid by Accent
Group to House of HR and the elimination of EUR 6,76 million plus value on the sale of shares in Gighouse
and Nowjobs from Accent to House of Invest.


-----

### 8 Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant & equipment increased by EUR 53,82 million during the first nine months of the accounting
period. Movement in property, plant & equipment relate mainly to the acquisitions done (EUR 22,45 million,
mainly relating to leases) and the lease contracts (EUR 30,23 million) as the net book value is impacted
by new contracts signed or prolongment of current contracts.

### 9 Intangible assets

Intangible assets increased by EUR 135,15 million during the first nine months of the accounting period.
This fluctuation results mainly from the acquisitions:

  - SOLCOM for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 14,36 million and
EUR 66,59 million respectively,

  - TMI for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 7,30 million and EUR
52,93 million respectively,

  - Vijverberg for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 0,41 million and
EUR 1,45 million respectively,

  - Sira Consulting for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 0,11 million
and EUR 0,62 million respectively,

  - Bis People for which customer relationships are valued at EUR 1,50 million, no value is allocated
to the brand name as it will not be used by the Group,

  - StaffMe for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 0,87 million and
EUR 2,53 million respectively,

  - Locum Doctors for which customer relationships are valued at EUR 8,92 million. As from 2023
Avanti and Locum Doctors will go to the market as a new House of HR German Healthcare
Powerhouse using the brand of Avanti, as such no value is allocated to the brand name of Locum
Doctors.

  - FID for which a brand name and customer relationships are valued at EUR 0,48 million and EUR
3,50 million respectively.

The increase is partially compensated by the amortization charges on brand names and customer
relationships of EUR 31,83 million.

### 10 Goodwill

Goodwill has increased by EUR 212,60 million and is highly impacted by the acquisitions:

  - SOLCOM for which a goodwill of EUR 101,96 million has been recorded in the Engineering and
Consulting segment,

  - Atrium for which a goodwill of EUR 2,43 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent
Solutions segment,

  - TMI for which a goodwill of EUR 42,70 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent Solutions
segment,,

  - BE-Consult for which a goodwill of EUR 2,10 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent
Solutions segment,,

  - Vijverberg for which a goodwill of EUR 2,01 million has been recorded in the Engineering and
Consulting segment,

  - Sira Consulting for which a goodwill of EUR 0,83 million has been recorded in the Engineering and
Consulting segment,

  - Bis People for which a goodwill of EUR 3,45 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent
Solutions segment,


-----

  - StaffMe for which a goodwill of EUR 19,64 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent
Solutions segment,

  - Locum Doctors for which a goodwill of EUR 43,08 million has been recorded in the Specialized
Talent Solutions segment, and

  - FID for which a goodwill of EUR 7,71 million has been recorded in the Specialized Talent Solutions
segment.

An impairment test is annually performed based on Q3 interim financial statements. However, during Q2
2022, the rising interest rates have been considered as an impairment indicator. Consequently, an
impairment test has been performed as per 30 June 2022.
Except for GRITT, no goodwill impairment has been identified. With regard to GRITT, part of the
Engineering and Consulting Segment, the recoverable amount amounted to EUR 40,93 million, compared
to a carrying value of EUR 54,23 million. Although the results of GRITT are in line with the budgeted results,
the change in WACC has impacted the recoverable amount negatively. Considering the current market
conditions, this change is considered to be long-term and a goodwill impairment of EUR 13,30 million has
been recorded.
As interests rates increased further during Q3 2022 another impairment test has been performed as per
30 September 2022. The carrying amount of GRITT, amount to EUR 40,93 million including the impairment
of EUR 13,30 million is in line with the recoverable amount. As such, no further impairment has been
recorded.

The value in use is calculated using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by
management covering a five-year window. Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using
a 2% growth rate. This growth rate is consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to the
industry in which each CGU operates.


**Post-tax discount**
**Segment** **EBITDA margin** **Growth rate**

**rate**


Specialized Talent Solutions 14,4% 9,7% 2,0%
Engineering & Consulting 14,2% 19,4% 2,0%

### 11 Financial instruments by category

The financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at 30 September 2022 and 31 December 2021 are
classified as financial asset/liability at amortized cost. The group holds one financial asset at fair value
through P&L of which the value at 30 September 2022 is 0, please refer to note 13.

### 12 Other non-current assets

Other non-current assets increased by EUR 0,57 million which is mainly related to:

  - The asset deal of sociaal.nl which includes a bank guarantee of EUR 0,50 million,

  - House of Finance granted EUR 0,54 million loans to the managers of SOLCOM to allow them to
invest in future capital increases of House of HR,

  - GRITT Projects repaid its loan to the Group for an amount of EUR 1,15 million, and

  - Increase of long term warranties related to buildings following the increase of lease contracts.


-----

### 13 Derivative financial instruments

A derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to an embedded derivative – the right for the
issuer to exercise an early payment option. As this option is not considered to be closely related to the
host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized and has been measured at the fair value on initial
recognition with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the income statement.
The prepayment option relating to the Senior (Un)Secured Notes is valued using financial models available
in Bloomberg. The value of the option feature is equal to the difference between the bond price observed
on the market and the estimated bond price if there was no redemption option. It is then adjusted to capture
the impact of the costs of refinancing. The main parameters of the analysis are the bond price, the volatility
of interest rates and the net book value of the refinancing fees.
At year-end 2021 the value of the derivative financial asset amounted to EUR 3,03 million. Since Q1 2022
the derivative is valued at 0. The difference in fair value has been recorded in the income statement.

### 14 Trade and other receivables

Trade receivables increased by EUR 118,14 million, mainly influenced by the acquisitions done (EUR
46,94 million) and increased sales. Next to that, EUR 37,45 million increase relates to the estimated sales
of Covebo and the timing difference of the trade receivables balance between Covebo closing date 11
September 2022 and 30 September 2022.

Forward-looking information has been considered in assessing the Expected Credit Loss impairment under
IFRS 9, taking into consideration the possible downside resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. This did
not result in a significant impact on the ECL model assumptions.

Other receivables increased by EUR 20,51 million, influenced by

  - EUR 2,39 million increase in advance invoices received and paid during the first half of the year
which are deferred over the full year, mainly concerning the accident insurance in TimePartner
which is paid in advance as from 2022,

  - The increase in VAT receivable balance of EUR 1,60 million,

  - EUR 2,63 million increase of grants to be received, related to the build-up of grants to be received
for the year 2022,

  - EUR 2,20 million increase in contract assets

  - EUR 1,40 million receivable towards former shareholders of Cohedron for a tax claim, and

  - EUR 14,41 million increased receivables from the factoring company, of which EUR 2,27 million is
relating to the newly acquired group SOLCOM. The difference between the gross trade receivable
sold and the amount received from the factoring company is recorded as other receivables. The
increase in this balance is in line with the increase in the trade receivables.
SOLCOM had a factoring contract in place at the moment of acquisition. In the course of Q2 2022
this contract has been terminated and SOLCOM has been integrated into the factoring agreement
of the Group.

  - These movements are partly offset by a decrease of EUR 4,36 million withholding tax reductions
related to 2021 that have been received in Accent Construct. There is no build-up for 2022 since
the withholding tax reductions are now settled on a net basis with the withholding tax charges,
and

  - The repayment of the loan that was given to GRITT Projects for an amount of EUR 2,33 million.


-----

### 15 Income tax

Income tax expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of the weighted average effective
annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year.

The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2022 is 291,4%, compared to 40,6% for the nine months
ended 30 September 2021. The average annual tax rate is highly impacted by the losses of Corporate
(EUR 64,55 million, excluding non-taxable dividend income of EUR 34,98 million, as per 30 September
2022 compared to EUR 18,81 million, excluding non-taxable dividend income of EUR 1,04 million, as per
30 September 2021) and the impairment recorded in 2022 (refer to note 10). Excluding these losses the
average annual tax rate amounts to 32,1% for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 30,2% for the
first nine months of 2021.

The increase in the deferred tax liabilities (EUR 32,99 million) is in line with the deferred taxes on the brand
names and customer relationships, partially offset by the revaluation of the early repayment option and the
depreciation and amortization recorded on the customer relationships, brand names and the refinancing
fees.
Deferred tax assets are mainly impacted by a decrease of EUR 1,10 million of the deferred tax asset on
the losses of Avanti recorded in 2021.

### 16 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by EUR 33,39 million. Refer to the consolidated cash flow
statement.

The cash and cash equivalents include EUR 21,01 million of restricted cash. These deposits are subject
to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands (system of G-accounts containing amounts for taxes to be
paid on salaries) or relate to deposits for buildings/branches and are therefore not available for general
use by the other entities within the Group.

### 17 Equity

The authorized share capital and share premium of the Group as per 30 September 2022 amounts to EUR
337,90 million and is composed of 535.553.717 shares.

In March 2022 House of HR proceeded with a capital increase in order to allow the existing shareholders
to invest in House of HR pro-rata their existing shareholding, and to allow the managers of the recently
acquired entity SOLCOM and other managers to become a shareholder. The capital increase amounted
to EUR 32,07 million and EUR 5,83 million presented by 17.856.556 shares.

An additional capital increase took place in June 2022 to allow the managers of the recently acquired group
TMI and the entities Vijverberg and Sira Consulting to become a shareholder. The capital increase
amounted to EUR 33,28 million presented by 15.955.572 shares.


-----

Next to the capital increases, the equity in 2022 is impacted by the buy-out of minority shareholders in
Newco Greenworking (refer to note 3.3) and the acquisition of StaffMe of which 29,2% of the shares relate
to minority shareholders.

The changes in equity for the first six months of 2021 are related to a capital increase of EUR 20,81 million,
the acquisition of Greenworking, of which 40% of the shares relate to minority shareholders, the acquisition
of Avanti, of which 11% of the shares relate to minority shareholders, and the buy-out of the minorities
(1,16% of the shares) in Mykelson.

### 18 Borrowings

The bank loans were initially measured at fair value, with subsequent measurement at amortized cost.
Fluctuations in these bank loans result from the amortization of the refinancing fees.

The Group did not have any loan default or breach of any loan agreements during the first nine months of
2022.

Thanks to the deleveraging achieved along 2021, an additional Term Loan B add-on facility of EUR 190,00
million was successfully completed in the market as per 3 February 2022. The funds will be used to support
M&A activities of House of HR. At the same time, House of HR also successfully increased its Revolving
Credit Facility from EUR 100,00 million to EUR 125,00 million. The refinancing expenses attributable to
these transactions are capitalized as part of the loan and are being depreciated over the lifetime of the
loan.

As per February 19, 2021 the Group has successfully repriced their Senior Facility Agreement, resulting
in a 50 BPS reduction. The total impact of the repricing amounts to EUR 13,07 million saving for the Group.
Total financing expenses for this repricing are capitalized as part of the bank borrowings and are being
depreciated over the remaining lifetime of the loan.

On 28 May 2022, the Group announced that Bain Capital Private Equity – one of the world’s leading private
investment firms – has entered into a share purchase agreement for the acquisition of a 55% stake in the
Group. Management, Naxicap and Conny Vandendriessche will hold the remaining equity. The new
strategic partnership will maintain the Company's entrepreneurial spirit, help the Group scale its unique
platform into new markets and increase digital investments.


-----

As a result of this transaction the company's existing Term Loan B, Senior Secured Notes and Senior
Subordinated Notes will be refinanced. A group of financial institutions committed to provide a debt
financing package in support of Bain Capital's acquisition of a majority stake in House of HR but the closing
of the transaction was not finalized as per 30 September 2022. On 3 November 2022 the deal has been
closed, refer to the subsequent events (note 32) for more information.

As based on contractual terms a mandatory early repayment in the current loan agreement is only triggered
upon change of control, which will occur upon closing of the deal, the classification of the borrowings is not
impacted by the share purchase agreement and is considered as long term as per 30 September 2022.

### 19 Provisions for other liabilities and charges

Provisions have increased by EUR 2,10 million. These relate to the acquisitions done (EUR 0,67 million)
and for a large part to the sickness provision (EUR 0,42 million), which increased as sickness strongly
increased since Covid-19. Next to that a provision of EUR 0,16 million has been recorded related to the
Long Term Incentive Plan signed for Book’U on 31 March 2022.

### 20 Employee benefit obligations

Employee benefit obligations increased by EUR 36,14 million. The increase relates to the acquisitions
done (EUR 17,39 million), timing of payment of the salaries, impacted also by the period end date of
Covebo closing (EUR 29,39 million), and the build-up of holiday pay, year-end premium and bonus
accruals on the other hand, partly offset by the pay-out of bonuses and holiday pay in 2022.

### 21 Share-based payments

The LTIP is comprised of 100 million share options, of which 75 million are granted during 2018, 12,5
million during 2019 and 12,5 million during 2021. The share options are granted free of charge at the grant
date. The fair value per share option at grant date in 2018 amounted to EUR 2,17 compared to the exercise
price of EUR 1,53 after the capital reduction of 2020. For the options granted in 2019, the fair value per
share amounted to EUR 1,33 and for the ones granted in 2021 EUR 1,63. The value of the option shares
has been determined based on an EBITDA-multiple model (correcting for net debt) and is recognized in
income statement based on the exit probability. Following the agreement with Bain Capital the share
options are expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the remaining value is recognized in
the income statement over the remaining expected lifetime.
As the expected volatility of the people included in the plan has no impact on the total value, no assumption
was made in this respect.

On 31 March 2022 an LTIP has been signed for Book’U, in which 7.279 share options have been granted.
Based on the estimated pay-out in 2027, when the plan ends, a provision of EUR 0,16 million has been
recorded.

### 22 Trade and other payables

Trade payables and other payables have increased by EUR 31,87 million, mainly impacted by the
acquisitions done in 2022 (EUR 30,06 million).


-----

### 23 Other liabilities

million of Locum Doctors, EUR 1,21 million increase in the estimated earn-out of Avanti, -EUR 1,89
million payment of the earn-out of TechMatch and -EUR 0,63 million payment of the earn-out of
Bevebo,

- An increase of EUR 10,00 million related to the part of the acquisition price of Locum Doctors that will
be reinvested,

- An increase in the VAT payable of EUR 6,16 million,

- Partly offset by EUR 13,4 million decrease in the interest accrual due to the timing of interest payments
done by House of Finance.

### 24 Revenues

year compared to 5,61% in 2021.

### 26 Depreciation, amortization and impairment of PP&E and Intangible assets

Depreciation and amortization expenses have increased in the first nine months of the current year (EUR
91,43 million) compared to the first nine months of the previous year (EUR 64,45 million). This increase is
related to amortization on the brand names and customer relationships of EUR 12,48 million, and for the
remaining part mainly related to the depreciation charges in newly acquired entities (EUR 9,75 million).


-----

### 27 Other gains and losses

The other gains and losses mainly relate to the increase in estimated earn-out of Avanti of EUR -1,21
million and TMI of EUR -0,65 million.

### 28 Finance result

Finance income mainly includes interest income on short-term bank deposits.

Finance expenses mainly include the interest on borrowings from banks, the amortization of the refinancing
costs (refer to note 18), the fair value adjustment on the embedded derivative (refer to note 13) and
expenses related to credit insurance and commercial finance.

Based on an updated scenario (refer to note 18) the amortized cost of the borrowings was adjusted. Hence,
in the first nine months of 2022 there are EUR 18,16 million fees recorded related to the bank borrowings.

### 29 Contingencies

### 32 Events after the reporting date

**M&A**

On 7 October 2022 the Redmore Group acquired 100% of the shares of the Agium group for a fixed price
of EUR 19,66 million, of which EUR 9,55 million will be reinvested in House of HR. Agium offers staffing
and ad interim services of skilled financial professionals (both on payroll and externally hired). The
Company also provides additional services such as recruitment (Talent & Business, hereafter: T&B),
coaching and training to clients located in The Netherlands.

House of HR has completed the deal with Bain Capital Private Equity on 3 November 2022, making the
latter the majority shareholder of the group with a 55% equity stake. The remaining equity is split between
the founder Conny Vandendriessche, the exiting majority shareholder Naxicap and more than 500
employee shareholders. Thanks to this new strategic partnership, House of HR will be able to scale up its
unique platform into new markets and increase digital investments.

In the light of this deal the existing share based payment plan has been settled with the beneficiaries. The
exercise price of the options in 2022 was 2,88 EUR per share.

Together with the closing of the transaction, the existing indebtedness has been repaid and replaced by a
total indebtedness of the group of EUR 1.859,08 million, in various tranches at various rates. Additionally,
a EUR 250 million Revolving Credit Facility is available for the group.

To optimize the legal structure a new holding entity has been established in France, which will acquire all
shares in the French groups via Newco Abylsen SAS and Nowjobs France II. As a result of this transaction
these entities will no longer be part of the consolidation scope of the House of HR group.

Next to that, the Group will buy out different minority shareholders. Refer to the below table for an overview
of the minority shares before and after the transaction.

House of HR’s offer to acquire the French company ABMI has been submitted to the relevant employee
representative bodies for consultation and is expected to be completed in Q4 2022, subject to regulatory
approvals and customary closing conditions. Once this transaction goes through, French company ABMI
will form a close partnership via a common holding with Abylsen, the French engineering group specializing
in Industry, Digital and Life Sciences services, part of House of HR since 2015. Founded in 1984, ABMI is
present in France and Belgium and has 750 employees of which 650 work as consultants. It is a consulting
and engineering services group with a multi-niche expertise and the ability to engage in 3 engineering
segments: (i) Product design and industrialization, (ii) Industrial processes & (iii) Industrial facilities (nuclear
and railway infrastructures). It had a turnover of 50 million euro in 2021. ABMI was previously majority
owned by Omnes Capital.

As a result of the sale of the majority of the shares to Bain, the composition of the Board of Directors has
changed. Eric Aveillan, Aurélien Dorkel, Astrid Heiremans, Philippe Marcel, Agathe Baujard, Grégoire de
Mazancourt, Corentin Desbois, Conny Vandendriesshe and Paul Thiers are no longer members of the
Board of Directors. New members are Leen Geirnaerdt and Mathias Boyer-Chammard.

House of HR follows with great concern the impact on the Ukrainian people following the invasion of
Ukraine by the Russian Federation early 2022. We are committed to support the population with actions
directed to facilitate the integration of the refugees upon arrival to the countries where we operate. House
of HR has no economic activities in Russia and Ukraine. House of HR does source citizens from Poland
and Romania to be employed in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Next to our sourcing channels
in Poland and Romania, we also have a commercial company ITDS, and Triple A in Poland but they have
no material impact on the overall group sales and EBITDA. Should of course supply issues arise (gas
supply/supply of parts/goods) impacting European industries (such as e.g. automotive, online logistics, …),
this could have some impact on our operations. Today, we do not see any material impact on overall group
sales and EBITDA, but it is difficult to predict what future impacts may be.

To the Board of Directors
Beversesteenweg 576
8800 Roeselare

**Review Report of the Statutory Auditor on the condensed consolidated interim financial**
**information for the nine months ended 30 September 2022**

_Introduction_

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim balance sheet of House of HR
NV (the “Company”) as of 30 September 2022 and the related condensed consolidated interim income
statement, condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, condensed
consolidated interim statement of changes in equity and condensed consolidated interim statement of
cash flows for the 9 months period then ended (the “Interim Financial Information”). The board of
directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Interim Financial Information in
accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting as adopted by the European Union. Our
responsibility is to issue a report on the Interim Financial Information based on our review.

_Scope of Review_

We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements
2410 “Review of interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity” (ISRE
2410). A review on interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
As such our review does not provide the assurance that we will identify all significant matters that we
might have discovered during an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

_Conclusion_

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying consolidated condensed financial information as of 30 September 2022 has not been
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial reporting as adopted by
the European Union.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

#### 1 GENERAL INFORMATION

House of HR NV (“HOHR” or “The Group”) – formally known as The House of His Royal majesty the customer II NV – is a limited
liability company incorporated and domiciled in Belgium. The registered office of the entity is Beversesteenweg 576, 8800
Roeselare.

HOHR, together with its subsidiaries, has its roots in the Belgian Accent Group, founded in 1995 by Ms. Conny Vandendriessche
and Mr. Philip Cracco. Naxicap Partners Limited made its initial investment in 2012 and became the majority shareholder in
2014 following the acquisition of Mr. Philip Cracco’s shares.

HOHR is a leading HR service provider focusing on two specific types of staffing:

- Specialized Talent Solutions: The Specialized Talent Solutions segment provides on the one hand temporary staffing solutions
with a focus on ‘temp-to-perm’ placements, international job candidate recruiting and permanent placements for clients who
need specific job profiles, and on the other hand (mostly) short-term staffing solutions to larger clients with multiple staffing
needs.

- Engineering & Consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving sectors like energy,
pharmaceuticals, technology, etc. The Group also assists clients with the search and selection of the right candidate, interim
management or secondment.

The external growth strategy as developed by management of HOHR resulted in several important acquisitions that were
successfully completed by the Group over the last years (Refer to the note 3 for more information). These acquisitions increased
the Group’s foothold in its core sector of delivering general staffing on a temporary basis to customers as well as in companies
active in niche sectors such as legal and financial services delivering highly ranged professionals to customers. Clients are both
SMEs and large corporations, occupying leading positions in all kinds of industries.

The consolidated financial statements of HOHR include the Company and its subsidiaries (all together “the Group”).

The Group currently has a network of about 700 offices in Europe, and is active in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France
and Switzerland, but also present in Spain, Portugal, Romania, Luxembourg and Poland.

It now employs almost 4.300 people and is providing jobs to over 57.000 people each day via its brands:

- Specialized Talent Solutions: TimePartner, Accent and Covebo;

- Engineering & consulting: Abylsen, Continu, Redmore, GRITT, Vialegis, Cohedron, AERO and IBB.

All recent acquisitions substantially contribute to the overall performance of the Group.

The Group structure as in place as per 31 December 2021 is filed in note 3.

All subsidiaries held directly or indirectly by the Group maintain their accounting records and prepare statutory financial
statements in accordance with local accounting regulations.

The financial statements are issued for authorization to the Annual Shareholders Meeting that will be held on 31 March 2022.
The Board of Directors approved the financial statements per 17 March 2022.


-----

#### 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

**2.1 Basis of preparation**
**(i) Compliance with IFRS**
These audited consolidated non-statutory financial statements are comprised of the consolidated statement of financial position,
the consolidated statement of financial performance, the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, the
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the period ended 31 December
2021 and the related notes.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted within the European Union.

**(ii) Historical cost convention**
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:

- Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited
exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

- Derivative financial instruments, debt and equity financial assets and contingent consideration that have been measured at fair
value;

- Cash-settled option plans for which the liability is measured at fair value;

- Other long-term employee benefits, for which the liability is measured in accordance with the projected unit-credit method.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated
financial statements are disclosed in note 5.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro (EUR) and all values are presented in EUR, except when otherwise
indicated.

**2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**
**(i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group**
Below an overview is filed of the impact on the Group of IFRS standards that became applicable for the first time as from 1
January 2021.

- Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 amendments (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS4, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16)

- Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Covid19 Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021

- Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: deferred of IFRS 9

None of these standards, amendments to standards and interpretations did have any impact on the unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements. The Group did not early adopt any other standard, interpretation, or amendment that
has been issued but is not yet effective.


-----

**(ii) New and amended standards not yet adopted by the Group**
Group’s management preliminary assessment revealed that the following standards and amendments to standards that have
been endorsed within the European Union and that are not yet applicable as per the first time for the financial year beginning
1 January 2021 should not have a material impact for the Group:

- Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations

- Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment

- Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets

- Annual improvements to IFRS 2018-2020: Amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of IFRS, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
and IAS 41 Agriculture.)

Standards and amendments to standards that have not yet been endorsed within the European Union and that are not yet
applicable as per the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2021:

- Amendments to IAS1: Presentation of Financial Statements Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current + disclosure
of accounting policies

- Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates

- Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction

- IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts

**2.3 Principles of consolidation and equity accounting**
**(i) Subsidiaries**
The consolidated non-statutory financial information includes the financial statements of entities over which the Group exercises
control. The Group controls an entity (including structured entities) when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity to decide
over relevant activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are
considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on
which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. Refer to note 3.1 for more information.

Intercompany transactions, balances, income and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial
position, statement of financial performance and statement of other comprehensive income as well as the statement of changes
in equity.

**(ii) Joint arrangements**
A joint arrangement operates in the same way as other entities, except that a contractual arrangement between the Group and
other ventures establishes joint control over the economic activity of the entity. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing
of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the
parties sharing control. Under IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint
operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than
the legal structure of the joint arrangement.

Joint operations
The Group recognizes its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any
jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements
under the appropriate headings. The Group does not have any joint operations as per 31 December 2021.

Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see below), after initially being recognized at cost in the
consolidated statement of financial position. Refer to note 3.2. for an overview of the Group’s joint ventures.


-----

Equity method
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the
Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in
other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates
and joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any
other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made
payments on behalf of the other entity.

Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the
Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary to
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in
note 2.11.

**(iii) Changes in ownership interests**
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity
owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling
and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the
adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognized in a separate reserve within equity
attributable to owners of the Group.

When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or
significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount
recognized in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for
the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or
liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence is retained, only a
proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where
appropriate.

**2.4 Foreign currency translation**
**(i) Functional and presentation currency**
Items included in the financial statements of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated non-statutory financial statements are
presented in euro (EUR), which is the Group’s functional and presentation currency.

**(ii) Transactions and balances**
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognized in the income
statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. They are deferred in equity if
they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment
in a foreign operation.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income
statement within ‘Finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement
within ‘Other gains/(losses), net’.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss,
are recognized as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities
classified as available-for-sale, are included in the fair value reserve in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that
are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was
determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.


-----

**(iii) Group companies**
The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that
have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet

- income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive income are translated at average
exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction
dates, in which case income and all resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income).

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings
and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognized in other comprehensive income.
When a foreign operation is sold or any borrowings forming part of the net investment are repaid, the associated exchange
differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

**2.5 Business Combinations**
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments
or other assets are acquired.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the:

- fair values of the assets transferred;

- liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;

- equity interests issued by the Group;

- fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and

- fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited
exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair
value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

The excess of the:

- consideration transferred;

- amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and

- acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity

over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of
the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their
present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at
which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are
subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity
interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement
are recognized in profit or loss.


-----

In case of a combination of entities which are ultimately controlled by the Group before and after the combination,
management has chosen to apply predecessor accounting instead of the acquisition method of accounting. The assets or
liabilities of these entities are not restated to their fair value, instead the Group incorporates the predecessor carrying values.
These are generally the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entities. As the combining entities are looked
at from the perspective of a transfer made by the controlling party, no new goodwill arises from the combination, and any
difference between price paid and the carrying amount of net assets exchanged is recorded as a separate reserve in equity.

**2.6 Goodwill**
Goodwill is measured as described in note 3 on the business combinations and in note 8 after initial recognition. Goodwill on
acquisitions of subsidiaries is shown separately in the statement of financial position. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures
and associates is included in equity accounted for investments and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance.

Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that it might be impaired and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of
an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cashgenerating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the
goodwill arose. The units or Groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes, being the operating segments.

**2.7 Intangible assets**
Intangible assets are recognized when the cost of an asset can be reliably measured and it is probable that the entity will obtain
future economic benefits from the asset over a period extending beyond the current fiscal year.

At initial measurement, intangible assets are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price, including import duties and
non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use.

**(i) Trademark and customer relationship contracts**
Separately acquired trademarks are shown at historical cost. Trademarks, licenses and customer relationship contracts acquired
in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. They have a finite useful life and are subsequently
carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

**(ii) Acquired computer software licenses**
Externally acquired software licenses are stated at historical costs and amortized over its estimated useful life.

**(iii) Internally developed software**
Costs associated with maintaining software programs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are
directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are
recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:

- it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use

- management intends to complete the software and use or sell it

- there is an ability to use or sell the software

- it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software are available,
and

- the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalized as part of the software include employee costs and an appropriate portion of
relevant overheads.

Development costs are amortized from the point at which the asset is ready for use.

Research expenditure and development expenditure that do not meet the criteria indicated above are recognized as an
expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent
period.


-----

**(iv) Amortization methods and periods of intangible assets**
The Group amortizes intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:

Intangible assets Amortization method Amortization periods

Trademarks Straight-line amortization Determined per purchase price allocation, between 11
and 20 years

Customer relationships Straight-line amortization Determined per purchase price allocation, between 7
and 15 years

Internally generated software Straight-line amortization 3 to 5 years
Up to 10 years for software with proven historical useful
life

Acquired computer software licenses Straight-line amortization 1 to 5 years

Other Straight-line amortization 3 to 5 years

**2.8 Property, plant and equipment**
All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Costs may also include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on
qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All
other repairs and maintenances are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.

The Group depreciates PP&E assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:

Property, plant and equipment Depreciation method Depreciation periods

Freehold land Not depreciated Not depreciated

Buildings Straight-line depreciation 35 years

Plant, machinery and equipment Straight-line depreciation 5 years

Vehicles Straight-line depreciation 5 years

Furniture and office equipment Straight-line depreciation 5 years

Leased plant and equipment Straight-line depreciation 5 years or shorter if lease term is shorter

Other tangible assets Straight-line depreciation 5 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than
its estimated recoverable amount. Refer to impairment of assets for more information (note 2.10).

PPE is derecognized either on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in profit or loss.
When revalued assets are sold, it is Group policy to transfer any amounts included in other reserves in respect of those assets to
retained earnings.

**2.9 Leases**
The Group leases mainly company cars, buildings and IT equipment.

All lease obligations, except for short term leases and low value items are considered on balance sheet, for which a right-of-use
asset (included in Property, Plant and Equipment) and lease liability (included in other liabilities) is accounted for.

Leases are capitalized at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the
minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other short-term and
long-term payables. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the
profit or loss over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for
each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired is depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the
asset’s useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the
lease term.

The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on their nature.


-----

The Group also acts as a lessor in the sublease of buildings. For these contracts the right-of-use asset is derecognized and a
lease receivable is recognized at the lease’s inception at the present value of the minimum lease payments. A gain or loss is
recognized at inception date for the difference between the fair value of the minimum lease payments of the sublease and the
value of the right-of-use asset in the head lease.

**2.10 Impairment of non-financial assets**
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for
impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other assets are
tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For assessing impairment, assets
are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered
an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

**2.11 Cash and cash equivalents**
For presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with
financial institutions, and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are
readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

**2.12 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations**
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if (1) their carrying amount will be recovered principally
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and (2) a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at
the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising
from employee benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under
insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.

An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs
to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not
more than any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the
sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognized at the date of derecognition.

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortized while they are classified
as held for sale. Interests and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue
to be recognized.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented
separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for
sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.

A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose
of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of
discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss.


-----

**2.13 Financial assets**
**(i) Classification**
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss), and

- those to be measured at amortized cost.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash
flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity
instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of
initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

**(ii) Recognition and derecognition**
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to
purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

**(iii) Measurement**
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value
through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction
costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely
payments of principal and interest.

Debt instruments
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and the cash
flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

- Amortized cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments
of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance
income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or
loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented
as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash
flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are
taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and
losses which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously
recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognized in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these
financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are
presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or
loss.

- FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt
investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognized in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses)
in the period in which it arises.

Equity instruments
The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management has elected to present
fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to
profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognized in
profit or loss as other income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognized in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as
applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported
separately from other changes in fair value.


-----

**(iv) Impairment**
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated with its financial assets carried at amortized
cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to
be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables, see note 12 for further details.

**(v) Derivatives**
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends
on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group did
not designate certain derivatives as hedge instruments.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the
hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged
item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.

Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in
profit or loss and are included in financial result.

As regards embedded derivatives, the Group assesses whether the derivative is closely related to the host instrument and
accounted for separately or not.

**2.14 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities**
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal
course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.

**2.15 Compound financial instruments**
Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible notes that can be converted to share capital, and the
number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value.

The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognized initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does
not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognized initially at the difference between the fair value of
the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction
costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortized cost
using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent
to initial recognition except on conversion or expiry.

**2.16 Trade receivables and other receivables**
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for sales made in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are
recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less loss
allowance. See note 12 for further information about the Group’s accounting for trade receivables and for a description of the
Group’s impairment policies.

If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

The other receivables – projects related to contracts with customers are classified as other receivables.


-----

**2.17 Share capital**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Mandatorily redeemable preference shares are classified as liabilities.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the
proceeds.

Where any Group company purchases the company’s equity instruments, for example as the result of a share buy-back or a
share-based payment plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is
deducted from equity attributable to the owners of House of HR as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of House of HR.

**2.18 Dividends**
A liability is recognized for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorized and no longer at the discretion
of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

**2.19 Borrowings**
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at
amortized cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the
income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable
that some or all the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there
is no evidence that it is probable that some or all the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for
liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates.

The fair value of the liability portion of a convertible bond is determined using a market interest rate for an equivalent nonconvertible bond. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortized cost basis until extinguishment on conversion or
maturity of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option. This is recognized and included in
shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects.

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or
expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another
party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss
as other income or finance costs.

Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the entity issues equity instruments to a creditor to extinguish all or
part of the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference
between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for
at least 12 months after the reporting period.

**2.20 Trade and other payables**
Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year
which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after
the reporting period. They are recognized initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method.

**2.21 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets**
**(i) Provisions**
The Group recognizes provisions for legal claims or similar types of obligations when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.


-----

Provisions are measured at the present value of Group management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
present obligation at the end of the reporting period. Where there are several similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow
will be required in settlement is determined by the Group by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is
recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be
small.

The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as
interest expense.

In case the Group expects a reimbursement from another party, the Group will recognize a separate asset when and only when
it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received. The amount recognized for the reimbursement shall not exceed the
amount of the provision. In the statement of comprehensive income, the expense relating to a provision may be presented net
of the amount recognized for a reimbursement.

**(ii) Contingent liabilities and contingent assets**
The Group does not recognize any contingent liabilities, instead contingent liabilities are disclosed, unless the possibility of an
outflow is remote. The Group discloses the inflow of economic benefits when it is probable. Contingent assets are recognized
when it is virtually certain that the economic benefits will flow into the Group.

**2.22 Current and deferred income tax**
The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. Tax is recognized in the statement of
financial performance, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the
applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to
temporary differences and to unused tax losses.

**(i) Current income tax**
The current income tax charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting
period in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is
subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate based on amounts expected to be paid to the tax
authorities.

**(ii) Deferred income tax**
Deferred income tax is accrued in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not
recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilize those temporary
differences and losses.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of
investments in foreign operations where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities
and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where
the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognized in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, respectively.


-----

**2.23 Employee benefits**
**(i) Short-term obligations**
The main employee benefits of the Group consist of short-term employee benefits for wages and salaries, including nonmonetary benefits and annual leave that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which
the employees rendered the related service. These liabilities are recognized in respect of employees’ services up to the end of
the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are
presented as current employee benefit obligations in the statement of financial position.

**(ii) Pension benefits**
Defined contribution plans
The Group has defined contribution plans as well as disability benefits in certain countries in which it operates whereby
contributions by the Group are funded through payments to independent entities. For these schemes, the Group’s obligation is
limited to the payment of these annual contributions.

The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

Because of the Belgian legislation applicable to the second pillar pension plans (the so-called “Wet op de Aanvullende
Pensioenen”), all Belgian pension plans that are structured as defined contribution plans are considered defined benefit plans
under IFRS. Because of this minimum guaranteed return, the employer is exposed to a financial risk since further contributions
could be required if the return on the assets is not sufficient to reach the minimum benefits to be paid. The Company has plans
that are financed through insurance contracts. The projected unit credit method has been used as the actuarial technique to
measure the defined benefit obligation. The related assumptions, the defined benefit obligation and related plan assets are
further disclosed in note 18.

Defined benefit plans
The Group does not offer defined benefit plans to its staff. For the specific situation on the Belgian pension plans, we refer to
above.

**(iii) Other long-term employee benefits**
Some Group entities provide jubilee benefits rewarding employees for long years of service. The liability recognized in the
statement of financial position is the present value of the obligation at the reporting date. The remeasurements have been
recognized in the statement of financial performance in full.

The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an unconditional right to
defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to
occur.

**(iv) Termination benefits**
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or when an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.

In the Netherlands there is a legal obligation to pay a termination benefit to temporary workers of which the amount is based on
the number of days one has been employed (“transitievergoeding”).

The Group recognizes termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates:

- when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and

- when the entity recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination
benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on
the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the
reporting period are discounted to present value.


-----

**2.24 Share-based payments**
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to key managers via the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).

The LTIP is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment plan.

Equity settled share-based payments
The fair value of the goods or services received is recognized with a corresponding increase in equity.

The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate
valuation model.

A share-based payment award generally vests upon meeting specified conditions. Vesting conditions are either:

- Service conditions, which require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service during which the services are
provided to the entity; or

- Performance conditions, which requires the counterparty to complete a specified period of service (i.e., a service condition)
and involves specified performance targets to be met while the counterparty is rendering the required service.

A performance condition is further defined as either a market condition or a non-market condition. A market condition is a
performance condition (i.e., requires specified targets to be met) and the performance conditions are related to the market price
(or value) of the entity’s equity instruments, such as: attaining a specified share price or achieving a specified target that is based
on the market price (or value) of the entity’s equity instruments relative to an index of market prices of equity instruments of
other entities. A condition linked to a purely internal financial performance measure, such as profit or earnings per share, is not a
market condition. Such measures will affect the share price, but are not directly linked to it, and hence are not market
conditions. For a market condition to be treated as a performance vesting condition rather than a non-vesting condition, there
must also be an implicit or explicit service condition.

Under IFRS 2, the nature of the condition (i.e., vesting or non-vesting, service, performance, market or non-market) affects the
timing of when the expense is recognized and, in some cases, the measurement of the expense. In addition, if a condition is not
met, whether the entity may reverse the previously recognized compensation expense depends on the nature of the condition
that was not met. Therefore, the classification of a condition is a critical step in accounting for share-based payment
transactions. Market conditions are only considered when estimating the fair value of the award at the grant date. Non-market
vesting conditions are not considered when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the grant date. Instead,
these vesting conditions are considered by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the
transaction amount to reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest. Such non-market vesting conditions include a
service condition.

**2.25 Revenue recognition**
The Group mainly generates revenue from offering temporary staffing solutions to its customers. The duration of these
temporary staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two years. The Group mainly offers
temporary staffing solutions in the following industries: construction industry, manufacturing industry, logistics industry, sales
and finance industry.

The Group also provides solutions to customers active in larger project-oriented businesses (such as the construction industry)
where apart from staffing also specific deliverables must be provided for. Projects may take one week up to two to three
months.

The Group has identified one performance obligation within the vast majority of its customer contracts, i.e. the delivery of
services for a predefined period of time by one or more temping staff or consultants. Revenue from temporary staffing solutions
is traditionally negotiated and invoiced to customers using an hourly rate (i.e. the transaction price). Temporary workers charge
all their worked hours on project codes which are then accumulated on a weekly or monthly basis and billed to customers.
Revenue from temporary staffing solutions is recognized over time upon rendering the services.

Revenues related to services rendered in the project business are recognized upon the performance of the service under
contract by comparing the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be
provided. This is determined based on the actual costs incurred as compared to the total expected costs to incur to successfully
complete the project.

Revenue from permanent placements includes the fee received or receivable for the services provided. This fee is generally a
percentage of the remuneration package of the candidate placed (net basis). The revenue of these placements is recognized at
a point in time on completion of the service when the performance obligations are fulfilled, (for example the start date of the
candidate placed).


-----

The Group recognizes project related receivables if the Group has a right to payment for goods and services already transferred
to a customer if that right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. These project related
receivables are recognized as part of the other receivables.

Contract fulfilment costs related to this project business are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the
pattern of the transfer of the goods and services to which these assets relate.

Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting
increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that
give rise to the revision become known to management.

Customers are invoiced on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis and the consideration is payable when invoiced.

The Group offers volume rebates to a limited number of customers. The Group applies the ‘most likely amount method’ for
contracts with a single volume threshold and the ‘expected value method’ for contracts with more than one volume threshold.

The Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the
customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.

For sales arrangements where the Group acts as a principal in the transaction and has the principal risk and rewards of
ownership, including amongst others, the obligation to deliver the services, revenue is reported gross by the Group. Under
arrangements where the Group acts as an agent, revenue is reported on a net basis.

**2.26 Interest income**
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired, the Group reduces
the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest
rate of the instrument and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans and
receivables is recognized using the original effective interest rate.


-----

#### 3 GROUP STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE OF HR 

Since the creation of the Belgian Accent Group in 1995, the Group has significantly expanded its business as a result of a
number of important and material external acquisitions. All these acquisitions are in-line with the mid- to long-term strategy of
the House of HR to gain a more international foothold and to become a Group mainly offering services around specialized
recruitment and engineering and consulting. The Group is now active in more than 10 European countries.

As part of the legal reorganization of the Group completed in 2018, the majority of the minority shareholders, which
represented former management of the acquired companies, exchanged their non-controlling interests, together with any
related shareholder loans (financial liabilities recognized in various entities of the Group) for cash and new shares issued by the
parent company of the Group. Consequently, the Group currently holds into the majority of its subsidiaries 100% of the issued
shares.

As a result of the changes in the equity held by non-controlling interests, the Group has adjusted the carrying amounts of the
controlling and any remaining non-controlling interests to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any
difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid
are directly recognized into equity.

During 2021, the Group further expanded with the acquisition of Solyne, Greenworking, Avanti, Cohedron, Vanberkel and
Bureau Brug.

The Group’s structure as per 31 December 2021 is as follows:

HR I = former Naxicap


-----

While the Group obtains control over the acquired entities, the Group does not always acquire all of the issued shares of these
entities. The remaining shares are held by the former management of the acquired entities. To facilitate the acquisitions, new
holdings are created in which the Group and the minority shareholders both contribute into the share capital in relation to the
shares in the holding held by them. These holdings are consolidated in full by the Group. Amounts allocated to the minority
shareholders are recognized as a separate component of the equity of the Group.

The following notes provide more information on the changes in the Group structure in 2021.

The goodwill resulting from these acquisitions is attributable to the workforce and the expected high profitability of the
acquired business. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

_Accounting policy choice for non-controlling interests_
IFRS allows the Group to recognize the non-controlling interests in an acquired entity either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. This decision is made on an acquisitionby-acquisition basis.

Group Management decided to recognize all the non-controlling interests at fair value.

_Acquired receivables_
The following table summarizes the fair value of acquired trade receivables as per acquisition date:

Acquired receivables Solyne Greenworking Avanti Cohedron Vanberkel Bureau Brug

Contractual amount of trade receivables due 2.208.645 2.494.728 4.273.911 18.994.165 3.938.294 3.117.260

Amount of uncollectible trade receivables 0 -9.567 -22.920 -207.348 -2.960

**Fair value of acquired trade receivables** **2.208.645** **2.485.161** **4.250.991** **18.786.817** **3.938.294** **3.114.300**

The gross amount of the acquired trade receivables approximates its fair value.

_Revenue and profit contribution_
The acquired businesses contributed since their acquisition dates the following amount of revenue and net profit to the Group:


Contribution to revenue and net profit since
the date of the acquisition:


Solyne Greenworking Avanti Cohedron Vanberkel Bureau Brug


Revenue: 22.454.880 8.394.896 37.639.236 70.335.482 8.205.865 1.229.351

Net profit: 2.990.706 2.927.291 3.125.172 -39.931 669.793 105.697

If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January of the year, consolidated pro-forma revenue and net profit for the year ended
would have been:


Contribution to revenue and net profit as if the
acquisition was completed per 1 January:


Solyne Greenworking Avanti Cohedron Vanberkel Bureau Brug

Van Berkel Van Berkel


Revenue: 22.454.880 8.394.896 63.442.494 159.021.269 17.511.683 6.882.703

Net profit: 2.990.706 2.927.291 -657.529 -3.979.127 1.264.426 1.371.392

These amounts have been calculated using the subsidiary’s results, adjusting them for:

- differences in the accounting policies between the Group and the subsidiary, and

- the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible
assets had applied from 1 January of every year, together with the consequential tax effects.

The net loss of avanti mainly results to a one-off bonus to former management on the one hand, and the depreciation on the
trademarks and customer relationships on the other hand. The net loss of Cohedron is impacted by one-off expenses relating to
the acquisition done and the depreciation on the trademarks, customer relationships and FLOW software. The FLOW software,
developed by Cohedron, brings together budget counselling, guardianship and debt counselling. The software is live as from
mid 2021 and replaces the former PLANgroep legacy system. The fair value of the FLOW software was determined based on a
10 year business plan and amounts to EUR 18,55 million, which is being depreciated over 10 years.

_Contingent assets and contingent liabilities_
The Group did not recognize any material contingent assets or contingent liabilities under the purchase price allocation
exercise.

Significant restrictions on certain assets within the subsidiaries
Cash and short-term deposits held in the Netherlands are subject to local exchange control regulations. These regulations
provide for restrictions on exporting capital from those countries, other than through normal dividends. The carrying amount of
restricted cash in the consolidated financial statements as per 31 December 2021 of EUR 7,63 million mainly relates to these
restrictions.

**(ii) Overview of material joint ventures**
The Group has a joint venture with Sixie BV. This entity has been incorporated during the last quarter of 2020 and is only
operational as from 2021.

**3.6 Discontinued operations**
As per June 23, 2020, a share and receivable transfer agreement has been signed resulting in the sale of GRITT Projects NV.
The Group, via its subsidiaries GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV held 100% of the shares in GRITT Projects NV. This transfer was
desirable for GRITT and Logi-Technic, and the House of HR group in general, as the business model of GRITT Projects was not
aligned with the group strategy and was not delivering the expected group performance. The client base was excessively
narrow, implying strong purchasing power from the customers, which resulted in lower margins than foreseen. This resulted in a
deteriorated financial situation of GRITT Projects. Furthermore, all parties are convinced that the new shareholders are in a
better position to make GRITT Projects profitable again in the coming years.

Following transactions have occurred in 2020 with regard to the sale of GRITT Projects NV:

1. Capital increase done by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV of EUR 3,24 million.
2. Sale of the shares held by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV, against EUR 1 closing price + a supplement of EUR 0,35 million
(the amount equal to the net proceeds from HOHR leaver procedure).

As a result of the above transactions, a total loss of EUR 19,58 million has been recorded in the P&L of 2020.

#### 4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

**4.1 Financial risk factors**
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including limited foreign exchange risk, cash flow and
fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The objective is to identify, quantify, manage and then monitor
events or actions that could lead to financial losses. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain interest risk
exposures. In particular, the Group protects the variable interest rate on loans via the use of caps that limit the exposure to
fluctuations of Euribor.

Risk management is carried out by the Group’s treasury department. Group’s treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial
risks with approval from the Board of Directors.

**Market risk**
Foreign exchange risk


Overview of exchange
rates


31 December 2021 31 December 2020

Average At year-end Average At year-end


CHF 1,09 1,04 1,08 1,09

PLN 4,57 4,60 4,44 4,57

RON 4,92 4,95 4,84 4,87

HUF 358,52 369,19 351,25 363,89

The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is very limited as the Group’s operations are essentially denominated in euro.
Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of these currencies of +/-10% is considered as immaterial.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.

At 31 December 2021, the Group has EUR 550,00 million of outstanding bank loans, structured as a bullet loan under the Senior
Facility Agreement. Once per year, excess cash flow is calculated based on final audited accounts which serve to determine
whether a mandatory prepayment of the Senior Facility Agreement should take place under this agreement. So far, no
mandatory prepayments have taken place. These loans are floating rate borrowings, with interest based on Euribor floored to
zero plus a fixed margin of 4,25 if leverage is greater than or equal to 3.25x.

As per February 19, 2021 the Group has successfully repriced their Senior Facility Agreement, resulting in a 50 BPS reduction.
As a result the interest is based on Euribor floored to zero plus a fixed margin of 3,75 depending on the leverage. The total
impact of the repricing amounts to EUR 13,07 million saving for the Group. Total financing expenses for this repricing of EUR
2,75 million are capitalized as part of the bank borrowings and are being depreciated over the remaining lifetime of the loan.

At 31 December 2021, the Group has EUR 370,00 million of outstanding Senior Secured Notes, due in 2026, with a fixed
interest rate of 4,375% and EUR 200,00 million of outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes, due in 2027, with a fixed interest rate of
7,50%.

No hedging instruments are in place during 2021 to cover any potential interest rate risk. Notes are issued with a fixed interest
rate of 4,375% and 7,50%. For Term Loan B (EUR 550,00 million) a variable interest rate is applicable.

The floating rate borrowings are entirely accounted for at amortized cost, and therefore the impact of changes in the market
interest rate on the fair value of these floating rate borrowings at the closing date will have no impact on the income statement
or on the equity. The Group does not apply hedge accounting.

Euribor floating rate borrowings which are not covered by the swaps are subject to interest rate risk. An increase (decrease) of
100 basis points in interest rate as per year-end would have an effect on profit after tax and equity as follows:


31 December 2021


Increase 100 bps **-5.500.000**

Decrease 100 bps **5.500.000**

The Group has in total EUR 5,72 million of borrowings from related parties outstanding at the period ended 31 December 2021.


-----

Credit risk
Credit risk for the Group mainly arises from cash and cash equivalents, favorable derivative financial instruments and deposits
with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables.

Risk management
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk other than that for ordinary debtors. The Group has policies to ensure
that the services are provided to customers with an appropriate credit history.

Credit risk is managed locally by each subgroup (brand). Credit risk mainly arises as credit exposures to customers, including
outstanding receivables.

The credit quality of customers, considering the financial position of customers, past experience and other factors, is closely
assessed by the credit department on a regular basis. During 2020 a credit insurance program was set-up through the entire
group, in order for House of HR to have control over their open receivables, especially in challenging Covid19 times.

Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the finance committee. The
utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored.

Management does not expect any material losses from non-performance by these counterparties.

Impairment of financial assets
The Group has three types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model:

- trade receivables for sales of services;

- receivables resulting from project services in progress;

- debt investments carried at amortized cost.

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was no identified impairment
loss.

Trade receivables
The Group applies the IFRS9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss
allowance for all trade receivables.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the
days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before each reporting year-end
and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect
current and forward-looking information on macro-economic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the
receivables.

Forward-looking information has been considered in assessing the Expected Credit Loss impairment under IFRS9, taken into
consideration the possible downside resulting from the Covid19 pandemic. This did not result in a significant impact on the ECL
model assumptions.

that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment
plan with the Group, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 120 days past due. Several factors
are considered in assessing the likelihood of impairment which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and project related receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating
profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

The Group first applies this policy under the incurred loss model, and then, for the rest of receivables which are not provided
for, the Group applies the expected credit loss model, and recognizes an additional provision.

Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of
committed credit facilities and the use of trade supplier credit terms.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group treasury. Group treasury
monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while
maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities (note 16) at all times so that the Group does not
breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into
consideration the Group’s debt financing plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets and,
if applicable external regulatory or legal requirements. The Group also uses factoring agreements with certain banks in order to
obtain early access to cash flows.

Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above balance required for working capital management is transferred to
the Group treasury. Surplus cash is retained to finance future growth of the Group through acquisitions.

In order to meet its cash outflow obligations, the Group uses cash flows generated from operating activities and credit facilities
with financial institutions if necessary. In order to mitigate the liquidity obligations in the less than one-year bucket, cash flows
from revolving credit facilities with drawdown rights for additional EUR 95,00 million are available until the termination date of
SFA, 26 July 2026. The Group has drawn EUR 95,00 million from the Revolving Credit Facility end of March 2020 to ensure
sufficient liquidity for the group considering the Covid19 pandemic. This has been repaid mid-June 2020. In July 2021 the
Group has drawn EUR 20,00 million from the Revolving Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of Cohedron. This had been repaid
in August 2021.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the
cost of capital.

Under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Group is required to comply with the financial covenant that the
consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio must be not more than 6.0:1.

The Group has complied with this covenant throughout the reporting period. As at 31 December 2021, the consolidated senior
secured net leverage ratio of the Group (net debt to normalized EBITDA; i.e. EBITDA adjusted based on the SFA agreement)
was 3.16:1.

Management considers there is no material risk of breaching any covenant in the foreseeable future.

Dividends
In general no dividends are paid out to majority shareholders. For the dividends declared to minority shareholders, please refer
to the note 3.4 on non-controlling interest.

**4.3 Fair value estimation**
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as trading and available-for-sale securities) is based on
quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted (unadjusted) market price used for financial assets held by the Group is
the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on
market conditions existing at each reporting date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for
long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date.
These instruments are included in level 2.

The instruments included in level 3 are those for which one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data.

The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the
current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

There are no enforceable master netting arrangements. The related receivables and payables in the statement of financial
position are presented gross while upon payment the net position is settled.

The Group has pledged cash on bank accounts, intercompany receivables, and shares of the Group and the most material
subsidiaries, as described in note 16 on borrowings. In case of default, the banks would be able to cover the debt from cash and
intercompany receivables as shown in the table above, and the rest in shares of the Group and related subsidiaries.

#### 5 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures.
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying
amount of the assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are
more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be wrong.

Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

**5.1 Accounting judgements**
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the
most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements:

**Determination of the consolidation scope of the Group**
Refer to note 3.1 for more information.

**Accounting for factoring agreements within the Group**
The Group entered into factoring agreements with banks, under which trade receivables of certain entities within the Group are
transferred to the factors. These entities are part of Accent Group and GRITT, and the factoring arrangements involve ING,
Belfius and KBC Bank. During 2020, the Group has implemented a commercial finance agreement (factoring) in TimePartner.
During 2021, the Group has implemented a commercial finance agreement (factoring) in Continu and Covebo. Furthermore, a
commercial finance agreement is in place at Avanti. Significant judgement is needed in order to assess whether the criteria for
derecognition of these assets under IFRS 9 has been met, and whether the Group can derecognize trade receivables at the
moment of transfer to the factors.

In order to meet the IFRS 9 criteria for the derecognition, substantially all risks and rewards of ownership related to the financial
asset (i.e. receivable) need to be transferred to the factor.

**Capitalization of development costs**
The Group internally develops software applications that are used in the day-to-day service offerings.

Development costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policy in note 2. Initial capitalization of costs is based on
management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility of the internally developed software is confirmed. Group
management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied
and the expected period of benefits.

**5.2 Critical judgements in applying the entities’ accounting policies**
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
described below.

The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were
prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or
circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

**Impairment testing on goodwill**
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in an arm’s length
transaction of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset.


-----

The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next
five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that
will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash- generating unit being tested.

The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected
future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.

The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash-generating units, including a sensitivity
analysis, are further explained in note 8.

**Fair value of financial instruments**
The Group has a Senior Facility Agreement and Senior (Un)Secured Notes. A derivative financial asset has been recognized in
relation to the embedded derivate – the right to exercise an early payment option. As this option is not considered to be closely
related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized separately from the host contract and has been measured at
fair value on initial recognition and subsequently at fair value through income statement.

The Optional Redemption of Notes is valued using financial models available in Bloomberg. The value of the option feature is
equal to the difference between the bond price observed on the market and the estimated bond price if there was no
redemption option. It is then adjusted to capture the impact of the costs of refinancing. The main parameters of the analysis are
the bond price, the volatility of interest rates and the net book value of the refinancing fees. For more details refer to note 11 on
derivatives.

**Share-based payment plans**
The Group has offered to a selected group of managers share-based compensation benefits, in order to incentivize them to
further develop the activities of the Group. The value of the LTIP at grant date has been calculated based on the equity value of
the entity, excluding the value of the tracking shares. Judgement was made in order to determine these assumptions. For more
detail, refer to the note 19.

**Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination**
As part of the purchase price allocations that were completed by the Group for the recent acquisitions of the Group, both brand
names and customer relationships have been accounted for by the Group at their estimated fair value. In determining the fair
value of these intangible assets, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the long-term growth rate, discount rates
and contributory asset charges. Refer to note 3.1 for more information.

**Taxes**
Uncertainties may exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and
timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and
complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or
future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.

The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of
the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of
previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred
tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax
planning strategies.

**Useful life and residual value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment**
Judgement is required in estimating the useful lives and residual value of intangible and tangible assets. The residual value is
the estimated amount that would be currently obtained from the disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of
disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.

Group management reviews its estimated useful life as well as the residual value of intangible and tangible assets on an annual
basis.

Refer to the PP&E note (note 9) and intangible assets note (note 7) for more information.


-----

**Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options**
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option
to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is
reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms between 3 and 9 years. The Group
applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant
factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses
the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise
(or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy).

The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of its buildings due to the significance of these
assets to its operations when it is reasonably certain that these renewal options will be exercised by the Group.

**Estimated earn-out**
Earn-out arrangements may exist as part of the negotiations of the purchase price in business combinations. At acquisition date,
the earn-out liability is calculated based on the most likely outcome, taken into account the information that is at hand at that
time. A revaluation of this estimate is performed at year-end, based on the updated information available. Judgement is
required in estimating the likely outcome of the earn-out as this frequently includes future information, such as expected
EBITDA growth or expected gross margin growth. In case of a difference between the initial estimate and the updated estimate
at year-end, the difference is recorded though P&L in Other gains & loss.

#### 6 SEGMENT REPORTING

As from 2021 the Group only presents two segments (instead of three previously) to reflect the integration of the General and
Specialized Staffing segments into the Specialized Talent Solutions segment which occurred in the course of Q1 2021. This
integration has been materialized through the successful completion of the partial merger between TimePartner and Zaquensis
in Q2 2021. A new holding company was created, i.e. “House of HR Germany”, holding all shares in the TimePartner and former
Zaquensis entities. The former holding companies, TimePartner Group Service GmbH and Zaquensis Holding GmbH, are
shareholder of House of HR Germany. This segment reporting also reflects better the strategy of House of HR towards
becoming even more specialized in the Human Resources solutions market. The final purpose of this segmentation is to better
focus on how to attract candidates and present the services to our client base.

This initiative is supported with the acquisition of Solyne, Greenworking, Avanti, Cohedron, Vanberkel and Bureau Brug in 2021
(refer to note 3.1).

With this new approach of two segments, the Group is able to deliver custom made solutions to our target markets, and
believes it will deliver faster than market sales growth.

- Specialized Talent Solutions: The Specialized Talent Solutions segment provides on the one hand temporary staffing solutions
with a focus on ‘temp-to-perm’ placements, international job candidate recruiting and permanent placements for clients who
need specific job profiles, and on the other hand (mostly) short-term staffing solutions to larger clients with multiple staffing
needs.

- Engineering & consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving sectors like energy,
pharmaceuticals, technology etc. The Group also assists clients with the search and selection of the right candidate, interim
management or secondment.

Corporate management is responsible for managing performance, underlying risks, and effectiveness of operations.

The table below shows the segment information provided to the strategic steering committee for the reportable segments and
the basis on which revenue is recognized.

The income statement of 2020 has been restated excluding the disposal of GRITT Projects NV (engineering & consulting
segment). The post-tax gain/loss from discontinued operations is presented on a separate line in the income statement. For a
detailed income statement of the disposed entity, refer to note 3.6.

Segment assets and segment sales are presented before elimination of intersegment transactions. Sales between segments are
on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

The group eliminations in 2021 contain, amongst others, the expense for the Long Term Incentive Plan of EUR 1,53 million (see
note 19), the elimination of EUR 1,04 million dividend on preferred shares from Accent Group to House of HR and the
elimination of EUR 6,76 million plus value on the sale of shares in Gighouse and Nowjobs from Accent to House of Invest.

The group eliminations in 2020 contain the expense for the LTIP of EUR 3,93 million (see note 19) and the elimination of EUR
19,05 million dividend on preferred shares paid by TimePartner to House of HR.

**(i) Acquisition related intangible assets**
The carrying amounts of the customer relationships and the brand names as per 31 December 2021 amount to EUR 228,87
million and EUR 54,91 million, respectively.

The customer relationships and brand names were acquired as part of a business combination or an asset deal. They are
recognized at their fair value at the date of acquisition and are subsequently amortized on a straight-line based on the timing of
projected cash flows of the contracts over their estimated useful lives.

The fair value is determined on a basis that reflects an amount that the entity would have paid for the asset in an arm’s length
transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties, based on the best information available.

Refer to the Business Combination note (note 3.1) for more information on the additions to the customer relationships and the
brand names.

During the last quarter of 2020, the Group launched the project to verify the impact of a possible merge between the
TimePartner group and the ZAQUENSIS group and consequently recorded an impairment for the tradename ZAQUENSIS of
EUR 5,70 million in the 2020 financial statements. Early 2021, the Board of Directors approved the merger of both companies
resulting in the disposal of the ZAQUENSIS brand in 2021.

**(ii) Software**
The Group capitalizes amounts of both externally acquired software and internally developed software. Internally developed
software is initially classified under the category “Software under development” and is transferred to the category “Internally
generated software” once the software becomes available for use. As from that moment amortizations will start.


-----

Externally acquired software
The carrying amount of externally acquired software amounts to EUR 0,28 million as per 31 December 2021. The main amounts
recorded for externally acquired software relates to licenses for ERP packages used within the Group (mainly Tagetik and
Navision).

Internally developed software and software under development
The carrying amount of internally generated software amounts to EUR 36,54 million as per 31 December 2021. The carrying
amount of software under development amounts to EUR 5,49 million as per 31 December 2021.

The majority of the internally developed software as well as the software under development relates to the “MyAccent app” and
the “My tools” digital platform that is used by Accent Jobs for People to run the HR business; the IT platform named “FLOW”
developed by Cohedron to bring together budget counselling, guardianship and debt counselling; and the development of the
apps created by the Group such as Nowjobs, SWOP, Softskills, etc.

The Group expenses a total of EUR 3,2 million of research and development expenditures in the income statement.

Amortizations on intangible assets are charged to the Selling Expenses (EUR 30,54 million) and the General and administrative
expenses (EUR 6,79 million) in the statement of financial performance.

There are no intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.

#### 8 GOODWILL 

Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated by Group management to the following two segments:

- The Specialized Talent Solutions segment, which provides on the one hand temporary staffing solutions with a focus on ‘tempto-perm’ placements, international job candidate recruiting and permanent placements for clients who need specific job
profiles, and on the other hand (mostly) short-term staffing solutions to larger clients with multiple staffing needs.
The Specialized Talent Solutions Segment is composed of the Accent Group, the Covebo Group, and the TimePartner Group,
excluding AERO and IBB which are part of the Engineering and Consulting segment.

- Engineering & Consulting: The Group recruits highly skilled professionals to work in fast evolving sectors like energy,
pharmaceuticals, technology, search and selection, interim management or secondment – in line with client needs.
The Engineering & Consulting segment is composed of the GRITT, Vialegis, Abylsen, Continu, Redmore, Cohedron and part
of the TimePartner Group, being AERO and IBB.

**Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the segments**
Movements in goodwill as well as the allocation of goodwill to the different segments at year-end is shown in the following

**Key assumptions used in value in use calculations**
The The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. This impairment test is annually
performed based on Q3 interim financial statements. For the 31 December 2021 reporting period, the recoverable amount of
the CGU’s was determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of assumptions.

The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year window
for the 2021 impairment. Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated


-----

below. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to the industry in which each CGU
operates.

The calculation of value in use for all CGU’s are most sensitive to the following assumptions:

- Post-tax discount rates: Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating
unit, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have not been incorporated in the
cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating
segments and derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity.
The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on
the interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual
beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data..

Engineering & Consulting **18,7%** 15,0%

- Growth rate estimates: Rates are based on published inflation rates provided by the IMF (International Monetary Fund). For
the reasons explained above, the long-term rate is used to extrapolate the projections.

Based on the goodwill impairment exercise performed, the carrying value of the CGU’s doesn’t exceed its recoverable amount.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**
With regard to the assessment of value in use of the two segments, Group's management believes that no reasonable possible
change in any of the above assumptions would cause the carrying value of the segment to materially exceed its recoverable
amount.

Nor a 0% sales growth, nor a decrease in EBITDA of 200 bps, nor an increase in WACC up to 200 bps impacts the carrying
amount of the goodwill and (in)tangible assets.

#### 11 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Group has the following derivative financial instruments:

**(i) Interest rate swaps and rate swaps**
There were no interest rate swaps within the Group as per 31 December 2020 nor per 31 December 2021.

**(ii) Early payment option on SSN and SUN**
The Group has Senior (Un)Secured Notes of EUR 570,00 million as disclosed in borrowings (refer to note 16 for more details). A
derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to an embedded derivative – the right for the issuer to exercise an
early payment option. As this option is not considered to be closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been
recognized and has been measured at the fair value on initial recognition with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the
income statement. The fair value of this early repayment option as per 31 December 2020 amounts to EUR 1,42 million for the
Senior Secured Notes and EUR 0,33 million for the Senior Unsecured Notes. At year-end 2021 a derivative financial asset of EUR
3,03 million has been recognized.

The prepayment option relating to the Senior (Un)Secured Notes is valued using financial models available in Bloomberg. The
value of the option feature is equal to the difference between the bond price observed on the market and the estimated bond
price if there was no redemption option. It is then adjusted to capture the impact of the costs of refinancing. The main
parameters of the analysis are the bond price, the volatility of interest rates and the net book value of the refinancing fees.

Relating to the Senior Unsecured Notes, three redemption options and one repurchase option is included in the Note. These
options are the following, i.e.

- Repurchase option triggered by a Change of Control

- Optional Redemption on Certain Tender Offers

- Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons

- Optional Redemption of Notes

The contract does not require the issuer to make mandatory redemption payments with respect to the Note. Expert judgement
is used to argue that the fair value of the following embedded options are nihil: Repurchase option triggered by a Change of
Control, Optional Redemption on Certain Tender Offers and Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons.

The Group does not use derivatives for speculative investments.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**
The value of the derivative is mainly impacted by the yield of the underlying debt. Sensitivity analysis performed on this yield
results in following valuation:


Spread -100


bps Base


Spread +100

bps


SSN 11,41 0,00 0,00

SUN 9,74 3,03 0,00

#### 12 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

Trade receivables

Trade receivables from third parties **236.818.665** 185.847.841

Less: provision for impairment **-6.343.134** -7.500.039

**Trade receivables, net** **230.579.860** 178.378.401

**(i) Classification as current trade receivables**
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables
have varying due dates, a period of 0 – 90 days comprises the range for credit terms. Therefore, they are classified as current
asset. Trade receivables are recognized initially at the amount of the consideration that is unconditional unless they contain
significant financing components, when they are recognized at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the
objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortized cost using the effective
i h d


-----

**(ii) Transferred receivables**
The Group entered into factoring agreements with banks, under which trade receivables of certain entities within the Group are
transferred to the factors. These entities are part of Accent Group and GRITT, and the factoring arrangements involve ING,
Belfius and KBC Bank, for a total of EUR 50,00 million. During 2020, the Group has implemented a commercial finance
agreement (factoring) in TimePartner. During 2021, the Group has implemented a commercial finance agreement (factoring) in
Continu and Covebo. The total commercial finance agreement for TimePartner, Continu and Covebo amount to EUR 100,00
million. For Avanti a commercial finance agreement was already in place at acquisition date. As both the late payment risk and
credit risk have been substantially transferred to the counterparty, this agreement has been accounted for as a non-recourse
agreement as the continuing involvement is considered insignificant. At year-end 2021, EUR 106,42 million accounts receivable
has been transferred to the factor which has been deducted from the open trade receivables as per December 31, 2021.
A further EUR 23,24 million is recorded as other receivable and comprises the difference between the gross trade receivable
sold and the amount received from the factoring company (90% for Accent and GRITT, 85% for TimePartner, 80% for Continu,
70% for Covebo and 90% for Avanti).

**(iii) Fair value of receivables**
Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value.

**(iv) Impairment and risk exposure**
Information about the impairment of trade receivables and the Group’s exposure to credit risk can be found in note 4. As the
Group is mainly active in the EURO-zone, there is no exposure to foreign currency risk. There is also no exposure to price risk as
the investments will be held to maturity.

**12.2 Other financial assets at amortized cost**
The Group classifies its financial assets at amortized cost only if both of the following criteria are met:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and

- the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

Financial assets at amortized costs as per 31 December 2021 include:

-----

**(i) Subleasing**
In 2020 a large leasing contract for housing was signed by Covebo of which a large part is subleased to an external party. This
results in a total receivable balance of EUR 6,81 million at year-end 2021 and an one-off gain of EUR 0,46 million at inception of
the contract (hence recorded in P&L in 2020) since the rent income on the sublease is higher than the rent cost on the main
lease.

**(ii) Loans granted to third parties**
The loans granted to third parties include a loan granted to the new shareholders of GRITT Projects NV, a subsidiary disposed
by the Group in 2020. The loan towards Happy Recruiter of EUR 0,75 million has been impaired to EUR 0 in 2021.

**(iii) Other non-current assets**
The other non-current assets relate mainly to financial guarantees paid by the Group for its ongoing lease contracts of branches
and housing accommodation.

**(iv) Other current receivables and prepayments**
The other receivables include EUR 4,30 million withholding tax deductions. The main amounts of the remaining current
receivables are related to accruals for income to be received/costs to be carried forward.

**(v) Other receivables – projects**
Project related receivables result from project services in progress for which the right to payment of goods or services have
been transferred to the customer. This relates to projects that typically cover a period of more than one year.

**(vi) Grants to be received**
A receivable of EUR 2,16 million has been recorded in Accent for wages and training expenses of people at work that can be
reclaimed. The amount that can be reclaimed depends on the amount of training given to the people at work and the number
of people hired from risk groups.

Covebo and Continu receive the LIV (“lage-inkomensvoordeel”) grant every year from the Dutch government, which is intended
to encourage employers to hire employees with a low wage. The amount received is a fixed fee for every hour worked by
employees with a wage within a certain range, that is defined by the government and indexed yearly. For 2021 the outstanding
receivable amounts to EUR 2,47 million.

TimePartner receives the KUG (“Kurzarbeit”; translated to compensation for reduced hours) grants from the German
government, in case the sales drop with >10% on branch level and for which the amount received is depending on the
number of hours the employee works less, and a refund for quarantine. For 2021 the outstanding receivable amounts to
EUR 4,64 million.

Refer to note 24 for more information on the grants.

**(vii) Commercial finance**
Refer to note 12.1 (ii).

**(viii) Fair values of other financial assets at amortized cost**
Due to the short-term nature of the other current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair
value. For the non-current receivables, the fair values are also not significantly different to their carrying amounts.

**(ix) Impairment and risk exposure**
Besides the impairment recorded on the loan towards Happy Recruiter, the Group did not account any loss allowances on the
other receivables. As the Group is mainly active in the EURO-zone, there is no exposure to foreign currency risk. There is also no
exposure to price risk as the investments will be held to maturity.

-----

The weighted average applicable tax rate is 44%, compared to 71% in 2020. The average tax rate is highly impacted by the
losses of Corporate, being House of HR, House of Invest and House of Finance (EUR 26,85 million in 2021 compared to EUR
7,65 million in 2020) and elimination of intragroup transactions (refer to note 6) that are taxable in the statutory accounts.
Excluding these items the average tax rate amounts to 30,6% in 2021 and 26,8% in 2020. Refer to (iv) for the main driver behind
this increase.

Primary drivers that impact the effective tax rates include the following:

**(i) Expenses not deductible for income tax purposes**
The recurring expenses not deductible for tax purposes include permanent differences such as expenses which are nondeductible under local tax laws (e.g. car expenses and meal expenses).

**(ii) Re-measurement of deferred tax – change in domestic tax rates**
The impact of the re-measurement of deferred taxes mainly relates to changes in the applicable income tax rates in the
Netherlands.

The Corporate Income Tax regime in the Netherlands has been modified. Originally this reform included a reduction of the
corporate tax rate from 25% from the year ending 31 December 2018 and 2019 to 22,55% from the year ending 31 December
2020, with a further decrease to 20,5% as from the year ending 31 December 2021. However, in 2020 this reform has been
adjusted and the income tax rate is again set on 25% for the years to come. In 2021 the Dutch Government approved an
increase of the income tax rate to 25,8% as from 2022.

Furthermore the tax rate in France changed from 26,5% in 2021 to 25% as from 2022.

The impact of this change in the tax rate has been recognized in the tax expense in profit and loss except to the extent that it
relates to items previously recognized outside of profit and loss.

**(iii) Unrecognized income tax assets**
The Group decided not to recognize additional deferred income tax assets on losses carried forward in some of its entities as
the Group believes that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is not probable.

The majority of the unrecognized deferred income tax losses relates to the House of HR NV, the entity on which the Corporate
projects are performed that are applicable for the total group. As no deferred tax asset has been recognized on the
(accumulated) losses, this impacts the Effective Tax Rate as presented in above table.

**(iv) Adjustments for current tax of prior periods**
In the course of 2021, Accent has requested a tax ruling relating to the cross-charge from Accent Group to other operational
entities within the group. The tax ruling is currently pending. The implications resulting from the tax ruling have been adjusted
retro-actively in the 2020 fiscal results, which are recorded in the 2021 financial statements. This adjustment has resulted in a
different tax base for fiscal year 2020 which has been reflected in the taxes in P&L in 2021.

**13.2 Amounts recognized directly in equity**
The deferred income taxes that have been recognized directly in equity are minor.


-----

**13.3 Deferred taxes**
Using the balance sheet liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to provide for temporary differences
between the value of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for tax purposes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current
tax liabilities, and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same tax jurisdiction.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at year-end and which are expected to
apply in the coming years when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The analysis of the deferred
income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities is as follows:

Deferred income tax assets are recognized for tax losses carried forward, excluding unused notional interest deduction (NID), to
the extent that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is probable, i.e. in those companies
where, based on business projections over a period of 10 years, the company estimates that the losses can be utilized within this
timeframe.

All borrowings which are due within one year from the year-end date are classified as current borrowings, as well as the current
portion of long-term borrowings.

**(i) Borrowings**
Bank borrowings
During December 2017, the bank loans were refinanced with a new Senior Facility Agreement at the Corporate level with
variable interest rates. The carrying amount of the drawings, net of transaction cost, was EUR 456,9 million. The drawings as per
31 December 2017 had 7 years of maturity and a variable interest rate based on Euribor plus a margin. In March 2018, an
additional tranche of EUR 125,00 million was withdrawn under the same terms.

In July 2019, the bank loans were refinanced with a new Senior Facility Agreement at Corporate level of EUR 550,00 million with
variable interest rates, together with an issuance of Senior Secured Notes of EUR 320,00 million. In August 2019 additional
Senior Secured Notes were issued of EUR 50,00 million.

In December 2020 Senior Unsecured Notes were issued of EUR 200,00 million.

These loans were initially measured at fair value, with subsequent measurement at amortized cost. The conditions for the new
loan issued in 2019 are similar to the proceeding loan. As a result, refinancing expenses relating to 2017 refinancing remain
capitalized and are amortized over the lifetime of the new loan. Additionally, refinancing expenses for the 2019 refinancing have
also been capitalized and are being depreciated over the lifetime of the loan. Financing expenses relating to the 2020 Senior
Unsecured Notes amount to EUR 5,85 million and have been capitalized. These are depreciated over the lifetime of the notes.

As per February 19, 2021 the Group has successfully repriced their Senior Facility Agreement, resulting in a 50 BPS reduction.
The total impact of the repricing amounts to EUR 13,07 million saving for the group. Total financing expenses for this repricing
of EUR 2,75 million are capitalized as part of the bank borrowings and are being depreciated over the remaining lifetime of the
loan.

Further, as per 3 February 2022, House of HR was able to successfully lend an additional EUR 190,00 million Term Loan B
facility, of which EUR 2,62 million financing expenses are capitalized per 31 December 2021.


-----

The Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes have an option for early repayment. These options has been valued at
EUR 4,08 million and EUR 0,35 million respectively at refinancing date, which is included in the fair value of the bank borrowings
and amortized over the lifetime of the notes. Refer to note 11 for more information on the repayment options..

Vendor loans
Vendor loans at 31 December 2021 relate to loans provided by former shareholders of Covebo for EUR 2,14 million and former
shareholders of Avanti for EUR 2,0 million.

Shareholder’s loans
In 2018, a shareholder’s loan has been provided to Vialegis Group.

Current borrowings
Current borrowings relate to the current portion of bank loans payable within one year after the year-end date.

The following tables show the movements of the borrowings of the Group:

-----

Significant assumptions taken for the fair value calculations at initial measurement
The difference between the fair value and carrying value in the table below for the bank loans is related to on the one hand paid
transactions costs that are reflected in the net book value, under the amortized cost method, and on the other hand the
derivative on the Senior (Un)Secured Note that was accounted for at fair value (refer to note 11). For the remaining borrowings,
the fair values are not materially different to their carrying amounts since the interest payable on those borrowings is either close
to current market rates or the borrowings are of a short-term nature.

**(ii) Financial covenants**
Under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Group is required to comply with the financial covenant that the
consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio must be not more than 6.0:1.

The Group has complied with this covenant throughout the reporting period. As at 31 December 2021, the consolidated senior
secured net leverage ratio of the Group (net debt to normalized EBITDA; i.e. EBITDA adjusted based on the SFA agreement)
was 3.16:1.

**(iii) Collateral for the Group’s bank borrowings**
For the bank loans in place (SFA loan agreements), multiple pledge agreements have been entered into which collectively
secure the bank borrowings for the entire amount outstanding and accrued interest on the bank borrowings. The Group is
subject to regular bank reporting, and leverage is monitored. In the event of a default of repayment of the bank borrowings and
related interest payments, the pledgee may enforce against the pledged assets. During the period under review, there was no
default of the payment obligations.

The present and future assets pledged as collateral include the following:

- All the shares of HOHR and material subsidiaries;

- All bank accounts of HOHR and material subsidiaries;

- All the intercompany loan receivables of the Group and material subsidiaries (excluding cash pooling).

We and our affiliates, or agents acting on our or their behalf, may retain, purchase, or sell for our own account any of our
outstanding publicly traded Notes, and may subsequently re-offer or re-sell any such Notes purchased. We do not intend to
disclose the extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligation
we may have to do so.

The table below outlines the outstanding employee benefit obligations that were reported on the statement of financial
position:

Short-term employee benefits **187.588.651** 138.946.354

Total current employee benefits **191.551.422** 141.804.344

**Total amount of employee benefits** **194.781.069** 144.920.719

**18.1 Short-term employee benefits**
The amount of short-term employee benefits outstanding at the reporting date mainly relates to unpaid salaries and wages as
well as the related taxes on these amounts. The amounts both relate to salaries and wages for temping staff as well as the
permanent staff that is working for the Group.

**18.2 Post-employment employee benefits**
**(i) Pension plans**
The Group offers several defined contribution plans to its employees. Because of the Belgian legislation applicable to the
second pillar pension plans (the so-called “Wet op de Aanvullende Pensioenen”), all Belgian pension plans that are structured
as defined contribution plans are considered defined benefit plans under IFRS. Because of this minimum guaranteed return, the
Group is exposed to a financial risk since further contributions could be required if the return on the assets is not sufficient to
reach the minimum benefits to be paid. The Group has plans that are financed through insurance contracts. The Group carefully
reviewed the different pension plans at the different reporting periods and concluded that the application of the projected unit
credit method to calculate the defined benefit obligation would not result in a material amount to be accounted for on the
statement of financial position. No similar minimum funding exists in other countries where the Group is active.

The Group does not provide any material defined benefit plans to its employees.

**(ii) Disability benefits**
The Group also provides disability benefits to its employees which have similar terms and conditions as the defined contribution
plans and therefore also must be accounted for in a similar way. As the Group is insured for these disability benefits, no
provision has been accounted for by the Group.

**18.3 Termination benefits**
The termination benefits relate to:

1. Outstanding payables towards former employees, mainly key management. Refer to note 34 Related Parties for more
information.
2. The transition accrual in the Netherlands (“Wet arbeidsmarkt in balans”; WAB).


-----

**18.4 Other long-term employee benefits**

#### 19 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

The share-based payments consist of the LTIP on the level of the shareholders of HOHR.

The Group launched a share-based payment plan throughout 2018 offering management team to participate in a LTIP. The
purpose of the plan is to create an incentive for members of management and executives of the Group who can make an
important contribution to the success and the growth of the Group, to help the Group retaining and attracting managers with
the necessary experience and skills, and to align the interests of those managers with the grantors’ interests as shareholders of
the Company and give them the opportunity to share in the value creation and growth of the Group.

The term of the options runs from the grant date until 28 June 2023 for Belgian tax residents (5 years maximum vesting period).
For other beneficiaries, the term of validity is maximum 10 years.

The plan is settled in the ordinary shares of the Company. The option holder may exercise the options subject to the occurrence
of an exit event, a non-exit event or a good leaver event.

The plan contains several vesting conditions:

a. Service conditions – the beneficiary should have a contractual relationship with the group at the vesting date (in case of an
exit or a non-exit event) or qualify as a good leaver (in case of a good leaver event);
b. Performance conditions – the number of options that vest (and can be exercised) is determined at the vesting date and
depends on the return (or a deemed return) of the grantors on the initial value (effectively the increase in the fair value of the
shares of the Group since 31/12/2017).

This LTIP is comprised of 100 million share options, of which 75 million are granted during 2018, 12,5 million during 2019 and
12,5 million during 2021. The share options are granted free of charge at the grant date. The fair value per share option at grant
date in 2018 amounts to EUR 2,17 compared to the exercise price of EUR 1,53 after the capital reduction of 2020. For the
shares granted in 2019 and 2021, the fair value per share amounts to EUR 1,33 and EUR 1,63 respectively. The value of the
shares has been determined based on an EBITDA-multiple model (correcting for net debt) and is recognized in P&L based on
the exit probability. As the expected volatility of the people included in the plan has no impact on the total value, no

recognized in the income statement with a corresponding credit in equity in 2018 for EUR 13,95 million and EUR 4,65 million in
2019, EUR 3,93 million in 2020 and EUR 1,53 million in 2021.

The average contractual lifetime per end of December 2021 for the options amounts to 5,05 years. The corresponding weighted
average exercise price amounts to 2,00 EUR.

The value of the LTIP at grant date has been calculated based on the equity value of the entity, excluding the value of the
tracking shares.

#### 20 TRADE PAYABLES AND OTHER PAYABLES

nature. These mainly relate to invoices for services such as rent, electricity, IT, etc. The increase in trade payables compared to
31 December 2020 mainly results from the 2021 acquisitions (EUR 20,58 million trade payables as per 31 December 2021). As

#### 24 GRANTS

Covebo and Continu receive the LIV (“lage-inkomensvoordeel”) grant every year from the Dutch government, which is intended
to encourage employers to hire employees with a low wage. The amount received is a fixed fee for every hour worked by
employees with a wage within a certain range, that is defined by the government and indexed yearly. For 2021 the grant
amounts to EUR 2,53 million.

An income of EUR 3,49 million has been recorded in Accent for wages and training expenses of people at work that can be
reclaimed. The amount that can be reclaimed depends on the amount of training given to the people at work and the number
of people hired from risk groups.

TimePartner receives the KUG (“Kurzarbeit”; translated to compensation for reduced hours) grants from the German
government only in case the sales drop with >10% on branch level. The amount received is depending on the total reduced
number of hours of the employee. Further, a refund for quarantine is granted. Due to Covid19, TimePartner has requested these

#### 36 COVID19

The great success in Covid19 vaccination rates along 2021 in Belgium, France, Germany, and The Netherlands has completely
changed life compared to 2020. This great success allowed the economic activity in our key markets to normalize.

The new favorable scenario is reflected in the evolution of the sales of the Group, as sales were accelerating along the year. In
the last weeks of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 the new strain of Covid19, Omicron, has spread enormously in the
population, but with limited impact in hospitalizations. The positive sales evolution along 2021 was not impacted, and the start
of 2022 has shown an even better evolution. Finally, all economic sectors are open and we expect to totally leave behind the
impact of Covid19 in the upcoming months.

#### 37 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE

**Borrowings**
Thanks to the deleveraging achieved along 2021, an additional Term Loan B add-on facility of EUR 190,00 million was
successfully completed in the market as per 3 February 2022. House of HR’s strong results, sound communication and
transparency on it resulted in a high demand and oversubscription of three times on the initial launch of EUR 150,00 million.
The funds will be used to support M&A activities of House of HR.

At the same time, House of HR also successfully increased its Revolving Credit Facility from EUR 100,00 million to
EUR 125,00 million.

**Acquisitions**
On 1 January 2022 Cohedron signed an asset deal with Sociaal.nl Schuldsanering BV to acquire its activities i.e. the workforce,
files, assets and liabilities related to administration, debt counseling and budget management for an amount of EUR 0,50
million.

House of HR is taking the next step in its growth process with the acquisitions of SOLCOM on 28 January 2022 and TMI on 10
February 2022.

SOLCOM is a leading IT service provider headquartered in Reutlingen (Germany). They recruit experts in IT and Engineering to
accompany clients through projects. House of HR has acquired 100% of SOLCOM, and SOLCOM’s management in turn will also
invest in House of HR by acquiring shares. With the acquisition of SOLCOM, House of HR is taking over one of the most
dynamic companies in their field. The company made an estimated turnover of EUR 172 million in 2021 and continues to grow
rapidly. House of HR acquired 100% of the shares for a price of EUR 175,00 million.

TMI is one of the largest HR service providers for the healthcare sector in the Netherlands. Both at home and abroad, TMI is
responsible for the recruitment of profiles for hospitals, public care institutions, ambulance staff, nursing homes, and so on.
Moreover, they also supply temporary staff (secondment), intermediate for freelancers, and offer flex jobs. The profiles they
work with include doctors, nursing staff, psychologists, and pharmacists. TMI's 2020 gross turnover was EUR 71 million. Its 2021
gross turnover is expected to be close to EUR 100 million. House of HR acquired 100% of the shares for a price of EUR 92,88
million.

On 24 February 2022 Accent Group acquired 100% of the shares of Atrium for a fixed price of EUR 1,75 million and an
maximum earn-out of EUR 0,45 million based on the EBITDA for 2022 and 2023. Atrium is a training center that provides
training to increase safety at work.

**Capital increase**
In March 2022 House of HR will proceed with two capital increases in order to allow the existing shareholders to invest in House
of HR pro-rata their existing shareholding, and to allow the managers of the recently acquired entities SOLCOM and TMI and
other managers to become a shareholder. In total the capital will increase with EUR 37,9 million. As per 9 March 2022, a capital
increase of EUR 32,1 million was completed.

**Other topics**
House of HR follows with great concern the impact on the Ukrainian people following the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian
Federation.

We are committed to support the population with actions directed to facilitate the integration of the refugees upon arrival to the
countries where we operate. We are today in talks with governmental agencies to speed up and facilitate the working permits
required so that they can become active and productive citizens in the countries they arrive in. Also our chatbot technology
Dora is reaching out to refugees in border areas to assist where possible.

House of HR has no economic activities in Russia and Ukraine. House of HR does source citizens from Poland and Romania to be
employed in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Next to our sourcing channels in Poland and Romania, we also have a
commercial company ITDS, and Triple A in Poland but they have no material impact on the overall group sales and EBITDA.
Should of course supply issues arise (gas supply/supply of parts/goods) impacting European industries (such as e.g. automotive,
online logistics, …), this could have some impact on our operations. Today, we do not see any material impact on overall group
sales and EBITDA, but it is difficult to predict what future impacts may be.

**STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING OF HOUSE**
**OF HR NV ON THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

We present to you our statutory auditor’s report in the context of our statutory audit of the consolidated
accounts of House of HR NV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (jointly “the Group”). This report
includes our report on the consolidated accounts, as well as the other legal and regulatory
requirements. This forms part of an integrated whole and is indivisible.

We have been appointed as statutory auditor by the general meeting d.d. 20 June 2019, following the
proposal formulated by the board of directors. Our mandate will expire on the date of the general
meeting which will deliberate on the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2021. We have
performed the statutory audit of the Company’s consolidated accounts for 6 consecutive years.

**Report on the consolidated accounts**

**_Unqualified opinion_**

We have performed the statutory audit of the Group’s consolidated accounts, which comprise the
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated income statement for the
period then ended and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated
statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended,
and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting
policies and other explanatory information, and which is characterised by a consolidated balance
sheet total of EUR 1.995.819.039 and a profit for the year of EUR 45.574.674.

In our opinion, the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the Group’s net equity and
consolidated financial position as at 31 December 2021, and of its consolidated financial performance
and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory
requirements applicable in Belgium.

**_Basis for unqualified opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in
Belgium. Furthermore, we have applied the International Standards on Auditing as approved by the
IAASB which are applicable to the year-end and which are not yet approved at the national level. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Statutory auditor’s responsibilities
_for the audit of the consolidated accounts” section of our report. We have fulfilled our ethical_
responsibilities in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
consolidated accounts in Belgium, including the requirements related to independence.

We have obtained from the board of directors and Company officials the explanations and information
necessary for performing our audit.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
our audit of the consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the
context of our audit of the consolidated accounts as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Impairment of goodwill – Note 8**

Description of the key audit matter

House of HR carries a significant value of goodwill on the balance sheet amounting to EUR 1.024
million as detailed in disclosure 8. Under the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed
by the EU (“IFRS’s”), the Company is required to test the amount of goodwill impairment at least
annually. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

We consider this matter as a key audit matter because of the significance of the account and because
of the complexity of the assessment process, the significant judgments in respect of assumptions
about the future results of the business and the discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts.
The most important management assumptions relate to the discount rate, growth rates of revenue and
EBITDA margin.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

We challenged if the impairment test was performed at the level of the CGU (the smallest group of
assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of each other). We challenged the cash
flow projections used in the impairment tests and the process through which they were prepared. We
found that the projected cash flow for 2022 was consistent with the Board approved budgets, which
were subject to timely oversight and challenge by the Directors.

We have critically assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and evaluation of
business plans by comparing the prior year’s forecast with the Group’s actual performance. For the
cash flows after 2021, we critically assessed and challenged the assumptions related to the long-term
growth rates, by comparing them to industry forecasts and historical growth rates.

We compared the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) to the cost of capital and debt of the
Group and comparable organisations, as well as considering territory specific factors. We tested the
calculation method used and the accuracy thereof. We compared EBITDA margin with past actuals.
We challenged the adequacy of management’s sensitivity analysis of the headroom. For all CGUs we
calculated the degree to which these assumptions would need to move before an impairment
conclusion was triggered and found the likelihood of such a movement to be unlikely.

Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the
Company’s discounted cash flow model and certain significant assumptions. We also assessed the
adequacy of the disclosures (Note 8) in the financial statements.


-----

We found management’s judgments in respect of the impairment test to be within an acceptable range
of reasonable estimates.

**Purchase Price Allocation of Cohedron (PPA) – Note 3.1**

Description of the key audit matter

House of HR NV performed a significant acquisition of Cohedron Group, as detailed in note 3.1 of the
financial statements. The Group acquired 100% of the share capital in Cohedron for EUR 115,43
million during the financial year.

As set out in note 3.1, this is a significant acquisition since it represents an entire new ‘powerhouse’.

Under the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS’s”) and more
specifically in line with the requirements of IFRS 3 – Business Combinations the Directors performed a
purchase price allocation (PPA). The PPA is subject to significant Directors’ judgement and estimation
in the following areas:

   - Identification and valuation of potential provisions for risks;

   - Identification and valuation of intangible assets (including goodwill); and

   - Determination of the amortisation period for the identified intangible assets.

Based on thorough due diligence analysis and detailed calculations, the Directors performed the PPA
and also determined the resulting goodwill.

We consider this matter to be a key audit matter because of the complexity of the assessment
process, the significant judgments and the estimates involved in respect of determining the PPA as
well as the value allocated to intangible assets and goodwill.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

We started by engaging our internal valuation experts to perform an independent assessment of the
fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the respective acquisition
dates specifically relating to the valuation and identification of intangible assets and the resultant
goodwill which was recognised. This independent assessment was evaluated against the Directors’
assessment by performing the following procedures:

   - We verified that the valuation methods used are consistent with the ones generally accepted
within the industry;

   - We verified that identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were appropriately valued,
in all material respects;

   - We scrutinized the SPAs and Due Diligence Reports relating to the acquisitions to identify
potential additional items to be valued as part of the PPA;
   - We assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions used in determining the useful lives of
the definite life intangible assets acquired, against those determined by the Directors;


-----

   - We assessed disclosure 3.1 in the financial statements against the relevant IFRS disclosure
requirements.

We found the assumptions and data used to be reasonable and in line with our expectations and
management’s methodology and estimates to be reasonable and the related company’s disclosures
appropriate .

**_Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated accounts_**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated accounts that give a true and
fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium, and for such internal
control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate
the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**_Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these consolidated accounts.

In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to
the audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium. A statutory audit does not provide any assurance as
to the Group’s future viability nor as to the efficiency or effectiveness of the board of directors’ current
or future business management at Group level. Our responsibilities in respect of the use of the going
concern basis of accounting by the board of directors’ are described below.


-----

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control;

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors;

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor’s report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated accounts, including
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the board of directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the board of directors, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the consolidated accounts of the current period and are therefore the
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter.


-----

**Other legal and regulatory requirements**

**_Responsibilities of the board of directors_**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the directors’ report on the
consolidated accounts.

**_Statutory auditor’s responsibilities_**

In the context of our engagement and in accordance with the Belgian standard which is
complementary to the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium, our
responsibility is to verify, in all material respects, the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts
and to report on these matters.

**_Aspects related to the directors’_** **_report on the consolidated accounts_**

In our opinion, after having performed specific procedures in relation to the directors’ report on the
consolidated accounts, this directors’ report is consistent with the consolidated accounts for the year
under audit and is prepared in accordance with article 3:32 of the Companies' and Associations' Code.

In the context of our audit of the consolidated accounts, we are also responsible for considering, in
particular based on the knowledge acquired resulting from the audit, whether the directors’ report on
the consolidated accounts is materially misstated or contains information which is inadequately
disclosed or otherwise misleading. In light of the procedures we have performed, there are no material
misstatements we have to report to you.

**_Statement related to independence_**

- Our registered audit firm and our network did not provide services which are incompatible with the
statutory audit of the consolidated accounts, and our registered audit firm remained independent
of the Group in the course of our mandate.

- The fees for additional services which are compatible with the statutory audit of the consolidated
accounts referred to in article 3:65 of the Companies' and Associations' Code are correctly
disclosed and itemized in the notes to the consolidated accounts.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

#### 1 GENERAL INFORMATION

House of HR NV (“HOHR” or “The Group”) – formally known as The House of His Royal majesty the customer II NV –
is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Belgium. The registered office of the entity is Beversesteenweg 576,
8800 Roeselare.

HOHR, together with its subsidiaries, has its roots in the Belgian Accent Group, founded in 1995 by Ms. Conny Vandendriessche
and Mr. Philip Cracco. Naxicap Partners Limited made its initial investment in 2012 and became the majority shareholder in
2014 following the acquisition of Mr. Philip Cracco’s shares.

HOHR is a leading HR service provider focusing on three specific types of staffing:

- General staffing: General temporary agencies delivering candidates to clients in a fast and flexible way, whenever they
are shorthanded.

- Specialized staffing: Specialized staffing companies in certain sectors including construction, retail, finance and many
other sectors.

- Engineering & consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving sectors like energy,
pharmaceuticals, technology etc. The Group also assists clients with the search and selection of the right candidate,
interim management or secondment.

The external growth strategy as developed by management of HOHR resulted in several important acquisitions that were
successfully completed by the Group over the last years (Refer to the Note 3 for more information). These acquisitions increased
the Group’s foothold in its core sector of delivering general staffing on a temporary basis to customers as well as in companies
active in niche sectors such as legal and financial services delivering highly ranged professionals to customers. Clients are both
SMEs and large corporations, occupying leading positions in all kinds of industries.

The consolidated financial statements of HOHR include the Company and its subsidiaries (all together “the Group”).

The Group currently has a network of over 600 offices in Europe, and is active in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France
and Switzerland, but also present in Spain, Portugal, Romania, Luxembourg and Poland.

It now employs almost 3.400 people and is providing jobs to over 43.000 people each day via its brands:

- General staffing: TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS;

- Specialized staffing: Accent, Covebo;

- Engineering & consulting: Abylsen, Continu, Redmore, GRITT, Vialegis, AERO and IBB.

All recent acquisitions substantially contribute to the overall performance of the Group.

The Group structure as in place as per 31 December 2020 is filed in Note 3.

All subsidiaries held directly or indirectly by the Group maintain their accounting records and prepare statutory financial
statements in accordance with local accounting regulations.

The financial statements are issued for authorization to the Annual Shareholders Meeting that will be held on 8 April 2021.
The Board of Directors approved the financial statements per 30 March 2021.

#### 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

**2.1 Basis of preparation**
**(i) Compliance with IFRS**
These audited consolidated non-statutory financial statements are comprised of the consolidated statement of financial position,
the consolidated statement of financial performance, the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, the
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the period ended
31 December 2020 and the related notes.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted within the European Union.

**(ii) Historical cost convention**
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:

- Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited
exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

- Derivative financial instruments, debt and equity financial assets and contingent consideration that have been measured
at fair value;

- Cash-settled option plans for which the liability is measured at fair value;

- Other long-term employee benefits, for which the liability is measured in accordance with the projected
unit-credit method.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated
financial statements are disclosed in Note 5.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro (EUR) and all values are presented in EUR, except when otherwise
indicated.

**2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**
**(i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group**
Below an overview is filed of the impact on the Group of IFRS standards that became applicable for the first time as from
1 January 2020. The nature and effect of adopting these new accounting standards is described below.

**Amendments to IFRS 16: Lease accounting**
On 28 May 2020, the IASB published ‘Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16)’ amending the standard
to provide lessees with an exemption from assessing whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification.
The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020.

The Group only received a very limited amount of Covid-19 related rent concessions.

**Other new standards, amendments and interpretations:**
Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2020, but do not have an impact on the consolidated
financial statements of the Group:

- Amendments to IFRS 3: Business Combinations

- Amendments to IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

- Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards

- Amendments to IAS 1: Definition of material

- Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 1 amendments (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)


-----

**(ii) New and amended standards not yet adopted by the Group**
Group’s management preliminary assessment revealed that the following standards and amendments to standards that have
been endorsed within the European Union and that are not yet applicable as per the first time for the financial year beginning
1 January 2020 should not have a material impact for the Group:

- Amendment to IFRS 4: Insurance Contracts – deferral of IFRS 9

- Interest rate benchmark reform – Phase 2 (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)

Standards and amendments to standards that have not yet been endorsed within the European Union and that are not yet
applicable as per the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2020:

- Amendment to IFRS 3: Business Combinations

- Amendment to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment

- Amendment to IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets

- Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020

- Amendments to IAS1: Presentation of Financial Statements Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current + disclosure
of accounting policies

- IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts

**2.3 Principles of consolidation and equity accounting**
**(i) Subsidiaries**
The consolidated non-statutory financial information includes the financial statements of entities over which the Group exercises
control. The Group controls an entity (including structured entities) when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity to decide
over relevant activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are
considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on
which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. Refer to Note 3.1 for more information.

Inter-company transactions, balances, income and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted
by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial
position, statement of financial performance and statement of other comprehensive income as well as the statement of changes
in equity.

**(ii) Joint arrangements**
A joint arrangement operates in the same way as other entities, except that a contractual arrangement between the Group and
other ventures establishes joint control over the economic activity of the entity. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing
of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the
parties sharing control. Under IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint
operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than
the legal structure of the joint arrangement.

Joint operations
The Group recognizes its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any
jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements
under the appropriate headings. The Group does not have any joint operations as per 31 December 2020.

Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see below), after initially being recognized at cost in the
consolidated statement of financial position.

Equity method
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the
Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in
other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates
d d d h f h


-----

When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any
other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made
payments on behalf of the other entity.

Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the
Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in
Note 2.11.

**(iii) Changes in ownership interests**
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity
owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling
and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the
adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognized in a separate reserve within equity
attributable to owners of the Group.

When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or
significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount
recognized in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting
for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or
liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence is retained, only
a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss
where appropriate.

**2.4 Foreign currency translation**
**(i) Functional and presentation currency**
Items included in the financial statements of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated non-statutory financial statements are
presented in euro (EUR), which is the Group’s functional and presentation currency.

**(ii) Transactions and balances**
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognized in the income
statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. They are deferred in equity if
they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment
in a foreign operation.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income
statement within ‘Finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement
within ‘Other gains/(losses), net’.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss,
are recognized as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities
classified as available-for-sale, are included in the fair value reserve in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that
are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was
determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.


-----

**(iii) Group companies**
The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that
have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet

- income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive income are translated at average
exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction
dates, in which case income and all resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income).

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings
and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognized in other comprehensive income.
When a foreign operation is sold or any borrowings forming part of the net investment are repaid, the associated exchange
differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

**2.5 Business Combinations**
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments
or other assets are acquired.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the:

- fair values of the assets transferred;

- liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;

- equity interests issued by the Group;

- fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and

- fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited
exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair
value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

The excess of the:

- consideration transferred;

- amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and

- acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired

is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired,
the difference is recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their
present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate
at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are
subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity
interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement
are recognized in profit or loss.


-----

In case of a combination of entities which are ultimately controlled by the Group before and after the combination,
management has chosen to apply predecessor accounting instead of the acquisition method of accounting. The assets or
liabilities of these entities are not restated to their fair value, instead the Group incorporates the predecessor carrying values.
These are generally the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entities. As the combining entities are looked
at from the perspective of a transfer made by the controlling party, no new goodwill arises from the combination, and any
difference between price paid and the carrying amount of net assets exchanged is recorded as a separate reserve in equity.

**2.6 Goodwill**
Goodwill is measured as described in Note 3 on the business combinations and in Note 8 after initial recognition. Goodwill on
acquisitions of subsidiaries is shown separately in the statement of financial position. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures
and associates is included in equity accounted for investments and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance.

Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that it might be impaired and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cashgenerating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the
goodwill arose. The units or Groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes, being the operating segments.

**2.7 Intangible assets**
Intangible assets are recognized when the cost of an asset can be reliably measured and it is probable that the entity will obtain
future economic benefits from the asset over a period extending beyond the current fiscal year.

At initial measurement, intangible assets are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price, including import duties and
non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use.

**(i) Trademark and customer relationship contracts**
Separately acquired trademarks are shown at historical cost. Trademarks, licenses and customer relationship contracts acquired
in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. They have a finite useful life and are subsequently
carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

**(ii) Acquired computer software licenses**
Externally acquired software licenses are stated at historical costs and amortized over its estimated useful life.

**(iii) Internally developed software**
Costs associated with maintaining software programs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are
directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are
recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:

- it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use

- management intends to complete the software and use or sell it

- there is an ability to use or sell the software

- it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software are available,
and

- the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalized as part of the software include employee costs and an appropriate portion
of relevant overheads.

Development costs are amortized from the point at which the asset is ready for use.

Research expenditure and development expenditure that do not meet the criteria indicated above are recognized as
an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent
period.


-----

**(iv) Amortization methods and periods of intangible assets**
The Group amortizes intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:

Intangible assets Amortization method Amortization periods

Trademarks Straight-line amortization Between 11 and 20 years

Customer relationships Straight-line amortization Between 7 and 12 years

Internally generated software Straight-line amortization 3 to 5 years

Acquired computer software licenses Straight-line amortization 1 to 5 years

Other Straight-line amortization 3 to 5 years

**2.8 Property, plant and equipment**
All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Costs may also include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on
qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced.
All other repairs and maintenances are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.

The Group depreciates PP&E assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:

Property, plant and equipment Depreciation method Depreciation periods

Freehold land Not depreciated Not depreciated

Buildings Straight-line depreciation 35 years

Plant, machinery and equipment Straight-line depreciation 5 years

Vehicles Straight-line depreciation 5 years

Furniture and office equipment Straight-line depreciation 5 years

Leased plant and equipment Straight-line depreciation 5 years or shorter if lease term is shorter

Other tangible assets Straight-line depreciation 5 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than
its estimated recoverable amount. Refer to impairment of assets for more information (note 2.11).

PPE is derecognized either on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in profit or loss.
When revalued assets are sold, it is Group policy to transfer any amounts included in other reserves in respect of those assets to
retained earnings.

**2.9 Leases**
The Group leases mainly company cars, buildings and IT equipment.

All lease obligations, except for short term leases and low value items are considered on balance sheet, for which a right-of-use
asset and lease liability is accounted for.

Leases are capitalized at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the
minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other short-term and
long-term payables. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the
profit or loss over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for
each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired is depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the
asset’s useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the
lease term.


-----

The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on their nature.

The Group also acts as a lessor in the sublease of buildings. For these contracts the right-of-use asset is derecognized and
a lease receivable is recognized at the lease’s inception at the present value of the minimum lease payments. A gain or loss
is recognized at inception date for the difference between the fair value of the minimum lease payments of the sublease and
the value of the right-of-use asset in the head lease.

**2.10 Inventories**
The Group measures its inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs of purchased inventory are determined
after deducting rebates and discounts. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less
the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets**
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for
impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other assets are
tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For assessing impairment,
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of
the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that
suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

**2.12 Cash and cash equivalents**
For presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with
financial institutions, and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are
readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

**2.13 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations**
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if (1) their carrying amount will be recovered principally
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and (2) a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured
at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising
from employee benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under
insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.

An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs
to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not
more than any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the
sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognized at the date of derecognition.

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortized while they are classified
as held for sale. Interests and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue
to be recognized.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented
separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held
for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.

A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose
of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of
discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss.

**2.14 Financial assets**
**(i) Classification**
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss), and

- those to be measured at amortized cost.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms
of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity
instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time
of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

**(ii) Recognition and derecognition**
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits
to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets
have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

**(iii) Measurement**
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value
through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction
costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely
payments of principal and interest.

Debt instruments
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and the cash
flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

- Amortized cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments
of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance
income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or
loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented
as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash
flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are
taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and
losses which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously
recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognized in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these
financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are
presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit
or loss.

- FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt
investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognized in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses)
in the period in which it arises.

Equity instruments
The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management has elected to present
fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses
to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognized
in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognized in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as
applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported
separately from other changes in fair value.


-----

**(iv) Impairment**
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated with its financial assets carried at amortized
cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses
to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables, see Note 12 for further details.

**(v) Derivatives**
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends
on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group did
not designate certain derivatives as hedge instruments.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the
hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged
item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.

Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately
in profit or loss and are included in financial result.

As regards embedded derivatives, the Group assesses whether the derivative is closely related to the host instrument and
accounted for separately or not.

**2.15 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities**
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal
course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.

**2.16 Compound financial instruments**
Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible notes that can be converted to share capital, and
the number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value.

The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognized initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does
not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognized initially at the difference between the fair value of
the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction
costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortized cost
using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent
to initial recognition except on conversion or expiry.

**2.17 Trade receivables and other receivables**
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for sales made in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are
recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less loss
allowance. See note 12 for further information about the Group’s accounting for trade receivables and for a description of
the Group’s impairment policies.

If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

The other receivables – projects related to contracts with customers are classified as other receivables.


-----

**2.18 Share capital**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Mandatorily redeemable preference shares are classified as liabilities.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from
the proceeds.

Where any Group company purchases the company’s equity instruments, for example as the result of a share buy-back or a
share-based payment plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes)
is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of House of HR as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of House of HR.

**2.19 Dividends**
A liability is recognized for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorized and no longer at the discretion
of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

**2.20 Borrowings**
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at
amortized cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in
the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable
that some or all the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there
is no evidence that it is probable that some or all the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for
liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates.

The fair value of the liability portion of a convertible bond is determined using a market interest rate for an equivalent nonconvertible bond. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortized cost basis until extinguishment on conversion or
maturity of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option. This is recognized and included
in shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects.

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or
expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another
party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss
as other income or finance costs.

Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the entity issues equity instruments to a creditor to extinguish all
or part of the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference
between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability
for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

**2.21 Trade and other payables**
Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year
which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after
the reporting period. They are recognized initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method.

**2.22 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets**
**(i) Provisions**
The Group recognizes provisions for legal claims or similar types of obligations when the Group has a present legal
or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.


-----

Provisions are measured at the present value of Group management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
present obligation at the end of the reporting period. Where there are several similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow
will be required in settlement is determined by the Group by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is
recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may
be small.

The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized
as interest expense.

In case the Group expects a reimbursement from another party, the Group will recognize a separate asset when and only when
it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received. The amount recognized for the reimbursement shall not exceed
the amount of the provision. In the statement of comprehensive income, the expense relating to a provision may be presented
net of the amount recognized for a reimbursement.

**(ii) Contingent liabilities and contingent assets**
The Group does not recognize any contingent liabilities, instead contingent liabilities are disclosed, unless the possibility of an
outflow is remote. The Group discloses the inflow of economic benefits when it is probable. Contingent assets are recognized
when it is virtually certain that the economic benefits will flow into the Group.

**2.23 Current and deferred income tax**
The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. Tax is recognized in the statement
of financial performance, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly
in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the
applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to
temporary differences and to unused tax losses.

**(i) Current income tax**
The current income tax charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting
period in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation
is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate based on amounts expected to be paid to the tax
authorities.

**(ii) Deferred income tax**
Deferred income tax is accrued in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are
not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises
from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws)
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related
deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilize those temporary
differences and losses.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of
investments in foreign operations where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities
and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where
the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.


-----

**2.24 Employee benefits**
**(i) Short-term obligations**
The main employee benefits of the Group consist of short-term employee benefits for wages and salaries, including nonmonetary benefits and annual leave that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which
the employees rendered the related service. These liabilities are recognized in respect of employees’ services up to the end of
the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are
presented as current employee benefit obligations in the statement of financial position.

**(ii) Pension benefits**
Defined contribution plans
The Group has defined contribution plans as well as disability benefits in certain countries in which it operates whereby
contributions by the Group are funded through payments to independent entities. For these schemes, the Group’s obligation
is limited to the payment of these annual contributions.

The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized
as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

Because of the Belgian legislation applicable to the second pillar pension plans (the so-called “Wet op de Aanvullende
Pensioenen”), all Belgian pension plans that are structured as defined contribution plans are considered defined benefit plans
under IFRS. Because of this minimum guaranteed return, the employer is exposed to a financial risk since further contributions
could be required if the return on the assets is not sufficient to reach the minimum benefits to be paid. The Company has plans
that are financed through insurance contracts. The projected unit credit method has been used as the actuarial technique to
measure the defined benefit obligation. The related assumptions, the defined benefit obligation and related plan assets are
further disclosed in Note 18.

Defined benefit plans
The Group does not offer defined benefit plans to its staff. For the specific situation on the Belgian pension plans, we refer
to above.

**(iii) Other long-term employee benefits**
Some Group entities provide jubilee benefits rewarding employees for long years of service. The liability recognized in the
statement of financial position is the present value of the obligation at the reporting date. The remeasurements have been
recognized in the statement of financial performance in full.

The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an unconditional right to
defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected
to occur.

**(iv) Termination benefits**
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or when
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.

In the Netherlands there is a legal obligation to pay a termination benefit to temporary workers of which the amount is based
on the number of days one has been employed (“transitievergoeding”).

The Group recognizes termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates:

- when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and

- when the entity recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination
benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on
the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the
reporting period are discounted to present value.


-----

**2.25 Share-based payments**
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to key managers via the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).

The LTIP is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment plan.

Equity settled share-based payments
The fair value of the goods or services received is recognized with a corresponding increase in equity.

The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate
valuation model.

A share-based payment award generally vests upon meeting specified conditions. Vesting conditions are either:

- Service conditions, which require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service during which the services are
provided to the entity; or

- Performance conditions, which requires the counterparty to complete a specified period of service (i.e., a service condition)
and involves specified performance targets to be met while the counterparty is rendering the required service.

A performance condition is further defined as either a market condition or a non-market condition. A market condition is a
performance condition (i.e., requires specified targets to be met) and the performance conditions are related to the market price
(or value) of the entity’s equity instruments, such as: attaining a specified share price or achieving a specified target that is based
on the market price (or value) of the entity’s equity instruments relative to an index of market prices of equity instruments of
other entities. A condition linked to a purely internal financial performance measure, such as profit or earnings per share,
is not a market condition. Such measures will affect the share price, but are not directly linked to it, and hence are not market
conditions. For a market condition to be treated as a performance vesting condition rather than a non-vesting condition, there
must also be an implicit or explicit service condition.

Under IFRS 2, the nature of the condition (i.e., vesting or non-vesting, service, performance, market or non-market) affects the
timing of when the expense is recognized and, in some cases, the measurement of the expense. In addition, if a condition is not
met, whether the entity may reverse the previously recognized compensation expense depends on the nature of the condition
that was not met. Therefore, the classification of a condition is a critical step in accounting for share-based payment
transactions. Market conditions are only considered when estimating the fair value of the award at the grant date. Non-market
vesting conditions are not considered when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the grant date. Instead,
these vesting conditions are considered by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the
transaction amount to reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest. Such non-market vesting conditions include
a service condition.

**2.26 Revenue recognition**
The Group mainly generates revenue from offering temporary staffing solutions to its customers. The duration of these
temporary staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two years. The Group mainly offers
temporary staffing solutions in the following industries: construction industry, manufacturing industry, logistics industry,
sales and finance industry.

The Group also provides solutions to customers active in larger project-oriented businesses (such as the construction industry)
where apart from staffing also specific deliverables must be provided for. Projects may take one week up to two to three
months.

The Group has identified one performance obligation within the vast majority of its customer contracts, i.e. the delivery of
services for a predefined period of time by one or more temping staff or consultants. Revenue from temporary staffing solutions
is traditionally negotiated and invoiced to customers using an hourly rate (i.e. the transaction price). Temporary workers charge
all their worked hours on project codes which are then accumulated on a weekly or monthly basis and billed to customers.
Revenue from temporary staffing solutions is recognized over time upon rendering the services.

Revenues related to services rendered in the project business are recognized upon the performance of the service under
contract by comparing the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be
provided. This is determined based on the actual costs incurred as compared to the total expected costs to incur to successfully
complete the project.

The Group recognizes project related receivables if the Group has a right to payment for goods and services already transferred
to a customer if that right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. These project related
receivables are recognized as part of the other receivables.


-----

Contract fulfilment costs related to this project business are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with
the pattern of the transfer of the goods and services to which these assets relate.

Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting
increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances
that give rise to the revision become known to management.

Customers are invoiced on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis and the consideration is payable when invoiced.

The Group offers volume rebates to a limited number of customers. The Group applies the ‘most likely amount method’ for
contracts with a single volume threshold and the ‘expected value method’ for contracts with more than one volume threshold.

The Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the
customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.

For sales arrangements where the Group acts as a principal in the transaction and has the principal risk and rewards of
ownership, including amongst others, the obligation to deliver the services and the credit risk, revenue is reported gross
by the Group. Under arrangements where the Group acts as an agent, revenue is reported on a net basis.

**2.27 Interest income**
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired, the Group reduces
the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest
rate of the instrument and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans and
receivables is recognized using the original effective interest rate.

#### 3 GROUP STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE OF HR 

Since the creation of the Belgian Accent Group in 1995, the Group has significantly expanded its business as a result of a
number of important and material external acquisitions. All these acquisitions are in-line with the mid- to long-term strategy
of the House of HR to gain a more international foothold and to become a Group mainly offering services around specialized
recruitment and engineering and consulting. The Group is now active in more than 10 European countries.

As part of the legal reorganization of the Group completed in 2018, the majority of the minority shareholders, which
represented former management of the acquired companies, exchanged their non-controlling interests, together with any
related shareholder loans (financial liabilities recognized in various entities of the Group) for cash and new shares issued by the
parent company of the Group. Consequently, the Group currently holds into the majority of its subsidiaries 100% of the issued
shares. All non-controlling interests held by former management in the Redmore and Vialegis Group were acquired by the
Group as per 14 January 2019.

As a result of the changes in the equity held by non-controlling interests, the Group has adjusted the carrying amounts of the
controlling and any remaining non-controlling interests to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any
difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid
are directly recognized into equity.

During 2020, the Group further expanded with the acquisition of TechMatch and Book’U. On the other hand, the Group sold
its share in GRITT Projects NV.

The Group’s structure as per 31 December 2020 is as follows:

HR I = former Naxicap


-----

While the Group obtains control over the acquired entities, the Group does not always acquire all of the issued shares of these
entities. The remaining shares are held by the former management of the acquired entities. To facilitate the acquisitions, new
holdings are created in which the Group and the minority shareholders both contribute into the share capital in relation to the
shares in the holding held by them. These holdings are consolidated in full by the Group. Amounts allocated to the minority
shareholders are recognized as a separate component of the equity of the Group.

The following notes provide more information on the changes in the Group structure in 2020:

**3.1 Business Combinations**
**(i) Overview of completed acquisitions**
Movement in minorities
The following movements in minorities have occurred during 2020:

**2020 acquisitions**
TechMatch
The Group, via its subsidiary Continu, has acquired 100% of the shares in TechMatch as per 23 January 2020. TechMatch
is an independent engineering staffing specialist, specialized in mechanical engineering, process engineering and electrical
engineering. The consideration paid for acquiring 100% of the shares is composed of a fixed purchase price (EUR 5,58 million)
and an earn-out. The earn-out is based on a multiple approach of the growth in gross margin for FY2021 vs FY2020. The
estimated earn-out at acquisition date amounted to EUR 5,67 million EUR, compared to EUR 3,46 million estimated earn-out at
year-end 2020. The expected payment is determined in respect of the individual earn-out agreement taking into consideration
management’s estimate of the expected level of profitability of the acquired company for the financial year 2020 and 2021.
Any change in the estimated earn-out of the company is recorded in the income statement.

TechMatch is included in the Group consolidation as from 1 January 2020.

Book’U
The Group had a minority stake in Book’U as per 31 December 2019 of 5,97%. As per 19 May 2020 a capital increase occurred
in Book’U via:

a. A contribution in kind of EUR 500 thousand and a contribution in cash of EUR 200 thousand, both subscribed by House
of Invest;
b. A contribution in kind of EUR 250 thousand subscribed by HM&C.

As a result of these contributions, House of Invest holds 80% of the shares of Book’U and has acquired control over the
company. Book’U is a company specialized in planning and administration tools. The investment in Book’U enables the
company to further focus on digitalization.

IFRS allows the Group to recognize the non-controlling interests in an acquired entity either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. This decision is made on an acquisitionby-acquisition basis.

Group Management decided to recognize all the non-controlling interests at fair value.

Acquired receivables
The following table summarizes the fair value of acquired trade receivables as per acquisition date:

Acquired receivables TechMatch BookU

Contractual amount of trade receivables due 1.639.945 59.943

Amount of uncollectible trade receivables -79.556 0

**Fair value of acquired trade receivables** **1.560.389** **59.943**

The gross amount of the acquired trade receivables approximates its fair value.

Revenue and profit contribution
The acquired businesses contributed since their acquisition dates the following amount of revenue and net profit to the Group:

Revenue: 10.364.841 69.812

If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January of the year, consolidated pro-forma revenue and net profit for the year ended

Revenue: 10.364.841 122.092

Net profit: 649.374 -590.624

These amounts have been calculated using the subsidiary’s results, adjusting them for:

- differences in the accounting policies between the Group and the subsidiary, and

- the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible
assets had applied from 1 January of every year, together with the consequential tax effects.

Contingent assets and contingent liabilities
The Group did not recognize any material contingent assets or contingent liabilities under the purchase price allocation
exercise.

Significant restrictions on certain assets within the subsidiaries
Cash and short-term deposits held in the Netherlands are subject to local exchange control regulations. These regulations
provide for restrictions on exporting capital from those countries, other than through normal dividends. The carrying amount of
the assets included within the consolidated financial statements to which these restrictions apply is EUR 3,66 million as per 31
December 2020.

**(ii) Overview of material joint ventures**
The Group has a joint venture with Sixie BV. This entity has been incorporated during the last quarter of 2020 and is only
operational as from 2021.

**3.6 Discontinued operations**
As per June 23, 2020, a share and receivable transfer agreement has been signed resulting in the sale of GRITT Projects NV.
The Group, via its subsidiaries GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV held 100% of the shares in GRITT Projects NV. This transfer was
desirable for GRITT and Logi-Technic, and the House of HR group in general, as the business model of GRITT Projects was not
aligned with the group strategy and was not delivering the expected group performance. The client base was excessively
narrow, implying strong purchasing power from the customers, which resulted in lower margins than foreseen. This resulted in a
deteriorated financial situation of GRITT Projects. Furthermore, all parties are convinced that the new shareholders are in a
better position to make GRITT Projects profitable again in the coming years.

Following transactions have occurred with regard to the sale of GRITT Projects NV:

1. Capital increase done by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV of EUR 3,24 million.
2. Sale of the shares held by GRITT NV and Logi-Technic NV, against EUR 1 closing price + a supplement of EUR 0,35 million
(the amount equal to the net proceeds from HOHR leaver procedure).

As a result of the above transactions, a total loss of EUR 19,58 million has been recorded.

#### 4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

**4.1 Financial risk factors**
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including limited foreign exchange risk, cash flow
and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The objective is to identify, quantify, manage and then monitor
events or actions that could lead to financial losses. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain interest
risk exposures. In particular, the Group protects the variable interest rate on loans via the use of caps that limit the exposure
to fluctuations of Euribor.

Risk management is carried out by the Group’s treasury department. Group’s treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial
risks with approval from the Board of Directors.

**Market risk**
Foreign exchange risk


Overview of exchange
rates


31 December 2020 31 December 2019

Average At year-end Average At year-end


CHF 1,08 1,09 1,11 1,09

PLN 4,44 4,57 4,30 4,26

RON 4,84 4,87 4,75 4,78

HUF 351,25 363,89

The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is very limited as the Group’s operations are essentially denominated in euro.
Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of these currencies of +/-10% is considered as immaterial.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.

At 31 December 2020, the Group has EUR 550 million of outstanding bank loans, structured as a bullet loan under the Senior
Facility Agreement. Once per year, excess cash flow is calculated based on final audited accounts which serve to determine
whether a mandatory prepayment of the Senior Facility Agreement should take place under this agreement. So far, no
mandatory prepayments have taken place. These loans are floating rate borrowings, with interest based on Euribor floored
to zero plus a fixed margin of 4.25% if leverage is greater than or equal to 3.25x.

At 31 December 2020, the Group has EUR 370 million of outstanding Senior Secured Notes, due in 2026, with a fixed interest
rate of 4,375% and EUR 200 million of outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes, due in 2027, with a fixed interest rate of 7,500%.

No hedging instruments are in place during 2020 to cover any potential interest rate risk. Notes are issued with a fixed interest
rate of 4,375% and 7,50%. For Term Loan B (EUR 550,00 million) a variable interest rate is applicable.

The floating rate borrowings are entirely accounted for at amortized cost, and therefore the impact of changes in the market
interest rate on the fair value of these floating rate borrowings at the closing date will have no impact on the income statement
or on the equity. The Group does not apply hedge accounting.

Euribor floating rate borrowings which are not covered by the swaps are subject to interest rate risk. An increase (decrease)
of 100 basis points in interest rate as per year-end would have an effect on profit after tax and equity as follows:


31 December 2020


Increase 100 bps **-5.500.000**

Decrease 100 bps **5.500.000**

*considering floor at 0%

The Group has in total EUR 3,72 million of borrowings from related parties outstanding at the period ended 31 December 2020.

Credit risk
Credit risk for the Group mainly arises from cash and cash equivalents, favorable derivative financial instruments and deposits
with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables.


-----

Risk management
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk other than that for ordinary debtors. The Group has policies to ensure
that the services are provided to customers with an appropriate credit history.

Credit risk is managed locally by each subgroup (brand). Certain subsidiaries have credit insurance in place. Negotiations are
ongoing to further implement this for the entire group. Credit risk mainly arises as credit exposures to customers, including
outstanding receivables.

The credit quality of customers, considering the financial position of customers, past experience and other factors, is closely
assessed by the credit department on a regular basis. During 2020 a credit insurance program was set-up through the entire
group, in order for House of HR to have control over their open receivables, especially in challenging Covid19 times.

Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the finance committee.
The utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored.

No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties.

Impairment of financial assets
The Group has three types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model:

- trade receivables for sales of services;

- receivables resulting from project services in progress;

- debt investments carried at amortized cost.

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was no identified impairment
loss.

Trade receivables
The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss
allowance for all trade receivables.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the
days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before each reporting year-end
and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect
current and forward-looking information on macro-economic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the
receivables.

Forward-looking information has been considered in assessing the Expected Credit Loss impairment under IFRS9, taken into
consideration the possible downside resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. This did not result is a significant impact on the ECL
model assumptions.

On that basis, the expected credit loss allowance as at 31 December 2020 was determined as follows for both trade receivables:

Trade receivables and project related receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators
that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment
plan with the Group, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 120 days past due. Several factors
are considered in assessing the likelihood of impairment which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and project related receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating
profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

The Group first applies this policy under the incurred loss model, and then, for the rest of receivables which are not provided
for, the Group applies the expected credit loss model, and recognizes an additional provision.

The aging overview as of each year-end date is as follows:

Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount
of committed credit facilities and use of trade supplier credit terms.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group treasury. Group treasury
monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while
maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities (Note 16) at all times so that the Group does not
breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into
consideration the Group’s debt financing plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets and,
if applicable external regulatory or legal requirements. The Group also uses factoring agreements with certain banks in order
to obtain early access to cash flows.

Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above balance required for working capital management is transferred
to the Group treasury. Surplus cash is retained to finance future growth of the Group through acquisitions.

In order to meet its cash outflow obligations, the Group uses cash flows generated from operating activities and credit facilities
with financial institutions if necessary. In order to mitigate the liquidity obligations in the less than one-year bucket, cash flows
from revolving credit facilities with drawdown rights for additional EUR 95,00 million are available until the termination date of
SFA, 26 July 2026. The Group has drawn EUR 95,00 million from the Revolving Credit Facility end of March to ensure sufficient
liquidity for the group considering the Covid19 pandemic. This has been repaid mid-June 2020.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce
the cost of capital.

Under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Group is required to comply with the financial covenant that the
consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio must be not more than 6.0:1.

The Group has complied with this covenant throughout the reporting period. As at 31 December 2020, the consolidated senior
secured net leverage ratio of the Group (net debt to normalized EBITDA; i.e. EBITDA adjusted based on the SFA agreement)
was 3.60:1.

Management considers there is no material risk of breaching any covenant in the foreseeable future.

Dividends
In general no dividends are paid out to majority shareholders. For the dividends declared to minority shareholders, please refer
to the Note 3.4 on non-controlling interest.

**4.3 Fair value estimation**
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as trading and available-for-sale securities) is based on
quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted (unadjusted) market price used for financial assets held by the Group
is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on
market conditions existing at each reporting date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for
long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date.
These instruments are included in level 2.

The instruments included in level 3 are those for which one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data.

The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the
current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

There are no enforceable master netting arrangements. The related receivables and payables in the statement of financial
position are presented gross while upon payment the net position is settled.

The Group has pledged cash on bank accounts, intercompany receivables, and shares of the Group and the most material
subsidiaries, as described in Note 16 on borrowings. In case of default, the banks would be able to cover the debt from cash
and intercompany receivables as shown in the table above, and the rest in shares of the Group and related subsidiaries.

#### 5 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures.
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying
amount of the assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which
are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be wrong.

Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

**5.1 Accounting judgements**
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have
the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements:

**Determination of the consolidation scope of the Group**
Refer to Note 3.1 for more information.


-----

**Accounting for factoring agreements within the Group**
The Group entered into factoring agreements with banks, under which trade receivables of certain entities within the Group
are transferred to the factors. These entities are part of Accent Group and GRITT, and the factoring arrangements involve ING,
Belfius and KBC Bank. During 2020, the Group has also implemented a commercial finance agreement (factoring) in
TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS. Significant judgement is needed in order to assess whether the criteria for derecognition of these
assets under IFRS 9 has been met, and whether the Group can derecognize trade receivables at the moment of transfer to the
factors.

In order to meet the IFRS 9 criteria for the derecognition, substantially all risks and rewards of ownership related to the financial
asset (i.e. receivable) need to be transferred to the factor.

**Capitalization of development costs**
The Group internally develops software applications that are used in the day-to-day service offerings.

Development costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2. Initial capitalization of costs is based on
management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility of the internally developed software is confirmed. Group
management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied
and the expected period of benefits.

**5.2 Critical judgements in applying the entities’ accounting policies**
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,
are described below.

The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were
prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes
or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

**Impairment testing on goodwill**
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in an arm’s length
transaction of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset.

The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next
five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that
will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash- generating unit being tested.

The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected
future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.

The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash-generating units, including a sensitivity
analysis, are further explained in Note 8.

**Fair value of financial instruments**
The Group has a Senior Facility Agreement and Senior (Un)Secured Notes. A derivative financial asset has been recognized in
relation to the embedded derivate – the right to exercise an early payment option. As this option is not considered to be closely
related to the host contract, a derivative asset has been recognized separately from the host contract and has been measured at
fair value on initial recognition and subsequently at fair value through income statement. The value of the option is calculated by
comparing the present value of the cash flows, assuming no prepayment takes places, discounted by the interest rate including
an option adjusted spread, minus the market value of the bond. For more details refer to Note 11 on derivatives.

**Share-based payment plans**
The Group has offered to a selected group of managers share-based compensation benefits, in order to incentivize them to
further develop the activities of the Group. The value of the LTIP at grant date has been calculated based on the equity value of
the entity, excluding the value of the tracking shares. Judgement was made in order to determine these assumptions. For more
detail, refer to the Note 19.


-----

**Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination**
As part of the purchase price allocations that were completed by the Group for the recent acquisitions of the Group, both brand
names and customer relationships have been accounted for by the Group at their estimated fair value. In determining the fair
value of these intangible assets, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the long-term growth rate, discount rates
and contributory asset charges. Refer to note 3.1 for more information.

**Taxes**
Uncertainties may exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and
timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and
complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made,
or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.

The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities
of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience
of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.

Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective
Group company's domicile. As the Group assesses the probability for litigation and subsequent cash outflow with respect to
taxes as remote, no contingent liability has been recognized.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred
tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax
planning strategies.

**Useful life and residual value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment**
Judgement is required in estimating the useful lives and residual value of intangible and tangible assets. The residual value is
the estimated amount that would be currently obtained from the disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of
disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.

Group management reviews its estimated useful life as well as the residual value of intangible and tangible assets on an annual
basis.

Refer to the PP&E note (Note 9) and intangible assets note (Note 7) for more information.

**Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options**
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option
to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is
reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms between 3 and 9 years. The Group
applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant
factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses
the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise
(or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy).

The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of its buildings due to the significance of these
assets to its operations when it is reasonably certain that these renewal options will be exercised by the Group.

#### 6 SEGMENT REPORTING

For management purposes the Group is organized in three operating segments based on the activity of the Group.
Management assesses segment performance based on the type of activity. HOHR is a leading HR service provider deriving
its revenues and profits from the following three specific types of staffing:

- General staffing: General temporary agencies delivering candidates to clients in a fast and flexible way, whenever they are
shorthanded.

- Specialized staffing: Specialized staffing companies in certain sectors including construction, retail, finance and many other
sectors

- Engineering & consulting: Highly skilled professionals are recruited to work in fast evolving sectors like energy,
pharmaceuticals, technology etc. The Group also assists clients with the search and selection of the right candidate, interim
management or secondment.

Corporate management is responsible for managing performance, underlying risks, and effectiveness of operations.

The table below shows the segment information provided to the strategic steering committee for the reportable segments and
the basis on which revenue is recognized.

The income statement has been restated excluding the disposal of GRITT Projects NV (engineering & consulting segment). The
post-tax gain/loss from discontinued operations is presented on a separate line in the income statement. For a detailed income
statement of the disposed entity, refer to note 3.6.

**(i) Acquisition related intangible assets**
The carrying amounts of the customer relationships and the brand names as per 31 December 2020 amount to EUR 111,17
million and EUR 44,18 million, respectively.

The customer relationships and brand names were acquired as part of a business combination. They are recognized at their fair
value at the date of acquisition and are subsequently amortized on a straight-line based on the timing of projected cash flows
of the contracts over their estimated useful lives.

The fair value is determined on a basis that reflects an amount that the entity would have paid for the asset in an arm’s length
transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties, based on the best information available.

Refer to the Business Combination note (Note 3.1) for more information on the additions to the customer relationships and the
brand names.

During the last quarter of 2020, the Group launched the project to verify the impact of a possible merge between the
TimePartner group and the ZAQUENSIS group. Although no decisions have been taken as per 31 December 2020, the Group
has recorded an impairment for the tradename ZAQUENSIS of EUR 5,70 million in the 2020 financial statements. Early 2021,
the Board of Directors approved the merger of both companies. Refer to note 37.

**(ii) Software**
The Group capitalizes amounts of both externally acquired software and internally developed software. Internally developed
software is initially classified under the category “Software under development” and is transferred to the category “Internally
generated software” once the software becomes available for use. As from that moment amortizations will start.


-----

Externally acquired software
The carrying amount of externally acquired software amounts to EUR 1,06 million as per 31 December 2020. The main amounts
recorded for externally acquired software relates to licenses for ERP packages used within the Group (mainly Tagetik and
Navision).

Internally developed software and software under development
The carrying amount of internally generated software amounts to EUR 16,55 million as per 31 December 2020. The carrying
amount of software under development amounts to EUR 1,95 million as per 31 December 2020.

The majority of the internally developed software as well as the software under development relates to new features in the
“MyAccent app” and the “My tools” digital platform that is used by Accent Jobs for People to run the HR business, and the
development of the apps created by the Group such as SWOP, Softskills, etc.

The Group did not expense a material amount of research and development expenditure in the income statement.

**(iii) Other intangibles**
The carrying amounts of the other intangibles as per 31 December 2020 are EUR 0,08 million.

Amortizations on intangible assets are charged to the Selling Expenses (EUR 29,76 million) and the General and administrative
expenses (EUR 6,11 million) in the statement of financial performance.

There are no intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.

#### 8 GOODWILL 

Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated by Group management to the following three cash-generating
units for goodwill impairment purposes:

- General staffing: General temp agencies delivering candidates to clients in a fast and flexible way, whenever they are
shorthanded.
The general staffing CGU is composed of the ZAQUENSIS Group and the TimePartner Group, excluding AERO and IBB which
are part of the CGU engineering and consulting.

- Specialized staffing: The Group strongly believes it requires specialists to hire specialists. The Group’s specialized staffing
companies know their niches and their clients like no one else.
The Accent Group and Covebo Group are considered as specialized staffing entities.

- Engineering & consulting: The Group recruits highly skilled professionals to work in fast evolving sectors like energy,
pharmaceuticals, technology, search and selection, interim management or secondment – in line with client needs.
The Engineering & Consulting CGU is composed of the GRITT, Vialegis, Abylsen, Continu, Redmore and part of the
TimePartner Group, being AERO and IBB.

**Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units**

The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year window
for the 2020 impairment. Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated
below. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to the industry in which each CGU
operates.

The calculation of value in use for all CGU’s are most sensitive to the following assumptions:

- Post-tax discount rates: Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating
unit, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have not been incorporated in the
cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating
segments and derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity.
The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on
the interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual
beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.

Based on the goodwill impairment exercise performed, the carrying value of the CGU’s, being Specialized Staffing, Engineering
& Consulting and General Staffing, doesn’t exceed its recoverable amount

(mio EUR)


General Staffing 80,06 40,60

Specialized Staffing 325,68 219,47

Engineering & Consulting 455,74 158,01

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**
With regard to the assessment of value in use of the three CGU’s, Group’s management believes that no reasonably possible
change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable
amount.

The CGU’s Specialized Staffing and Consulting and Engineering are strong markets for which nor a 0% sales growth nor a
decrease in EBITDA of 200 bps, nor an increase in WACC up to 200 bps impacts the carrying amount of the goodwill and
(in)tangible assets.

The CGU General Staffing is under pressure as a result of the AUG-reform in 2018, impacting the performance of the business in
Germany. Sensitivity analysis has shown sufficient headroom in calculating the carrying value of this CGU, as a 0% sales growth
in the perpetuity or an increase in WACC of 200 bps does not result in an impairment risk. EBITDA margin for General Staffing
however should be maintained as an EBITDA drop above 100 bps might result in an impairment risk.

#### 11 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Group has the following derivative financial instruments:

**(i) Interest rate swaps and rate swaps**
There were no interest rate swaps within the Group as per 31 December 2019 nor per 31 December 2020.

**(ii) Early payment option on SSN and SUN**
The Group has Senior (Un)Secured Notes of EUR 570,00 million as disclosed in borrowings (please refer to note 16 for more
details). A derivative financial asset has been recognized in relation to an embedded derivative – the right for the issuer to
exercise an early payment option. As this option is not considered to be closely related to the host contract, a derivative asset
has been recognized and has been measured at the fair value on initial recognition with subsequent changes in fair value
recorded in the income statement. At year-end 2019, a derivative financial asset of EUR 7,57 million has been recognized
relating to the early repayment option included in the Senior Secured Notes. The fair value of this early repayment option
as per 31 December 2020 amounts to EUR 1,42 million. At year-end 2020, a derivative financial asset of EUR 0,33 million has
been recognized relating to the early repayment option included in the Senior Unsecured Notes. Differences in fair value
in 2020 vs. 2019 are recorded via P&L, as finance income/expense (refer to note 30).

The prepayment option relating to the Senior Secured Notes is valued by taking the difference between two loan values.
The first loan value is calculated by discounting all cash flows of the loan with the interest rate at the time of the cash flow being
paid plus a constant spread; this value represents the value of the loan without a prepayment option. Regarding the second
loan value, the cash flows are also discounted by the interest rate at the time of the cash flow being paid plus a constant spread,
however, the amount of cash flows will decrease if the interest rate drops, e.g. the loan is prepaid. Since the option will only be
exercised if this is beneficial to the holder, the value of the option is floored at zero. This process is repeated for 10 thousand
(risk-neutral) interest simulations of which the average is taken in order to determine the price of the option at this time. The
valuation is done under the assumption that the loan is prepaid on the first payment date after the 7-year forward rate at a point
in time of the simulation passes below the initial 7-year forward rate, the prepayment option should be priced in a risk-neutral
setting and a regular smooth spline through the curves is fitted in order to interpolate different points on the curve.

Relating to the Senior Unsecured Notes, three redemption options and one repurchase option is included in the Note.
These options are the following, i.e.

- Repurchase option triggered by a Change of Control

- Optional Redemption on Certain Tender Offers

- Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons

- Optional Redemption of Notes

The contract does not require the issuer to make mandatory redemption payments with respect to the Note. Expert judgement
is used to argue that the fair value of the following embedded options are nihil: Repurchase option triggered by a Change of
Control, Optional Redemption on Certain Tender Offers and Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons.

The Optional Redemption of Notes is valued by taking the difference between two loan values. The first loan value is calculated
by discounting all cash flows of the loan with the interest rate at the time of the cash flow being paid plus a constant spread; this
value represents the value of the loan without a prepayment option. Regarding the second loan value, the cash flows are also
discounted by the interest rate at the time of the cash flow being paid plus a constant spread, however, the amount of cash
flows will decrease if the interest rate drops, e.g. the loan is prepaid.

Since the option will only be exercised if this is beneficial to the holder, the value of the option is floored at zero. This process
is repeated for 10 thousand (risk-neutral) interest simulations of which the average is taken in order to determine the price of
the option at this time.

The following assumptions have been used to model the embedded prepayment option. The Group expects the impact
of these choices to be neglectable:

- A 30/360 day count convention is used to determine the time till each coupon payment.

- A regular smooth spline if fit through the curves, in order to interpolate different points on the curve.

- The assumption is made that the Redemption option is executed on the first payment date when the fair value of the
Redemption Option is positive from the perspective of the issuer.

The Group does not use derivatives for speculative investments.


-----

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**
The value of the derivative is mainly impacted by the yield of the underlying debt. Sensitivity analysis performed on this yield
results in following valuation:

Less: provision for impairment **-7.500.039** -5.587.700

**Trade receivables, net** **178.378.401** 248.700.319

**(i) Classification as current trade receivables**
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables
have varying due dates, a period of 0 – 90 days comprises the range for credit terms. Therefore, they are classified as current
asset. Trade receivables are recognized initially at the amount of the consideration that is unconditional unless they contain
significant financing components, when they are recognized at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the
objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortized cost using the effective
interest method.

**(ii) Transferred receivable**
A commercial finance agreement of EUR 50,00 million is applicable at the level of Accent and GRITT, and in 2020 a new
contract has been signed of EUR 100,00 million for other companies where currently TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS are active
participants. As the late payment risk and credit risk has been transferred to the counterparty, this agreement has been
accounted for as a non-recourse agreement. At year-end 2020, EUR 60,62 million accounts receivable has been transferred
to the factor which has been deducted from the open trade receivables as per December 31, 2020. A further EUR 11,42 million
is recorded as other receivable and comprises the difference between the gross trade receivable sold and the amount received
from the factoring company (90% for Belgium and 85% for Germany).

**(iii) Fair value of receivables**
Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value.

**(iv) Impairment and risk exposure**
Information about the impairment of trade receivables and the Group’s exposure to credit risk can be found in Note 4. As the
Group is mainly active in the EURO-zone, there is no exposure to foreign currency risk. There is also no exposure to price risk
as the investments will be held to maturity.

**12.2 Other financial assets at amortized cost**
The Group classifies its financial assets at amortized cost only if both of the following criteria are met:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and

- the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

Other receivables from related parties **448.290** 282.828

**Total current assets** **39.816.504** 30.249.237

**(i) Subleasing**
In 2020 a large leasing contract for housing was signed by Covebo of which a large part is subleased to an external party.
This resulted in a total receivable balance of EUR 7,88 million and an one-off gain of EUR 0,46 million since the rent income
on the sublease is higher than the rent cost on the main lease.

**(ii) Loans granted to third parties**
The loans granted to third parties include (1) a loan granted to the new shareholders of GRITT Projects NV, a subsidiary
disposed by the Group in 2020 and (2) a loan receivable towards Happy Recruiter of EUR 0,70 million.

**(iii) Other non-current assets**
The other non-current assets relate mainly to financial guarantees paid by the Group for its ongoing lease contracts of branches
and housing accommodation.

**(iv) Other current receivables**
The main amounts of other current receivables are related to accruals for income to be received/costs to be carried forward.

**(v) Other receivables – projects**
Project related receivables result from project services in progress for which the right to payment of goods or services have
been transferred to the customer. This relates to projects that typically cover a period of more than one year. In 2019 these
receivables were mainly related to GRITT Projects.

**(vi) Grants to be received**
A receivable of 1,3 million EUR has been recorded in Accent for wages and training expenses of people at work that can be
reclaimed. The amount that can be reclaimed depends on the amount of training given to the people at work and the number
of people hired from risk groups.

Covebo and Continu receive the LIV (“lage-inkomensvoordeel”) grant every year from the Dutch government, which is intended
to encourage employers to hire employees with a low wage. The amount received is a fixed fee for every hour worked by
employees with a wage within a certain range, that is defined by the government and indexed yearly. For 2020 the outstanding
receivable amounts to EUR 2,3 million.


-----

TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS receive the KUG (“Kurzarbeit”; translated to compensation for reduced hours) grants from the
German government only in case the sales drop with >10% on branch level. The amount received is depending on the number
of hours the employee works less. Due to Covid-19, TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS have requested these grants. For 2020 the
outstanding receivable amounts to EUR 3,2 million for TimePartner and EUR 54 thousand for ZAQUENSIS.

**(vii) Commercial finance**
Refer to note 12.1 (ii).

**(viii) Fair values of other financial assets at amortized cost**
Due to the short-term nature of the other current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair
value. For the non-current receivables, the fair values are also not significantly different to their carrying amounts.

**(ix) Impairment and risk exposure**
The Group did not account any loss allowances on the other receivables. As the Group is mainly active in the EURO-zone,
there is no exposure to foreign currency risk. There is also no exposure to price risk as the investments will be held to maturity

**13.1.2 Numerical reconciliation of income tax expense**
The tax expenses as shown above have been calculated in conformity with local and international tax laws. The tax on the
Company’s profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the domestic rate in each individual
jurisdiction of the consolidated companies as follows:


31 December

2020


31 December

2019


**Profit/(loss) before taxes** **18.713.749** 79.580.127

Theoretical income tax rate in % **25%** 26%

**Tax calculated at domestic tax rates applicable to profit in the respective countries** **4.692.260** 20.580.689

Tax effect of amounts which are not deductible (taxable) in calculating taxable income:

Neutralization internal plus/less value **63.366**

Expenses nondeductible for tax purposes **7.398.856** 2.894.872

Dividends allocated to preference shareholders **644.305** -23.418

Notional interest deduction -4.459

Prolonged accounting year **19.449**

Adjustments for current tax of prior periods **-924.040** 2.850.299

Unrecognized deferred income tax losses **1.307.255** 7.135.670

Tax increase due to insufficient prepayments **159.854** 864.417

Tax losses with a valuation allowance **4.192.129**

Tax computed on other basis **-3.626.608** 1.070.860

Liquidation bonus **1.555**

IFRS adjustment **-1.108.346**

Share-based payments **983.443** 1.375.287

Re-measurement of deferred taxes: change in domestic tax rates **2.339.256** 720.487

Innovation deduction **-2.510.143**

**Corporate income tax** **13.241.341** 37.493.313

The weighted average applicable tax rate is 71%. Primary drivers that impact the effective tax rates include the following:

**(i) Expenses not deductible for income tax purposes**
The recurring expenses not deductible for tax purposes include permanent differences such as expenses which are nondeductible under local tax laws (e.g. car expenses and meal expenses).

**(ii) Re-measurement of deferred tax – change in domestic tax rates**
The impact of the re-measurement of deferred taxes mainly relates to changes in the applicable income tax rates in the
Netherlands.

The Corporate Income Tax regime in the Netherlands has been modified. Originally this reform included a reduction of the
corporate tax rate from 25% from the year ending 31 December 2018 and 2019 to 22,55% from the year ending 31 December
2020, with a further decrease to 20,5% as from the year ending 31 December 2021. However, in 2020 this reform has been
adjusted and the income tax rate is again set on 25% for the years to come.

The impact of this change in the tax rate has been recognized in the tax expense in profit and loss except to the extent that
it relates to items previously recognized outside of profit and loss. For the Group, these items are limited to the translation
of foreign operations using a different presentation currency as the one applied by the Group.

**(iii) Unrecognized income tax assets**
The Group decided not to recognize additional deferred income tax assets on losses carried forward in some of its entities
as the Group believes that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is not probable.

The majority of the unrecognized deferred income tax losses relates to the House of HR NV, the entity on which the Corporate
projects are performed that are applicable for the total group. As no deferred tax asset has been recognized on the
(accumulated) losses, this impacts the Effective Tax Rate as presented in above table.

**13.3 Deferred taxes**
Using the balance sheet liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to provide for temporary differences
between the value of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for tax purposes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current
tax liabilities, and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same tax jurisdiction.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at year-end and which are expected
to apply in the coming years when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The analysis of the deferred
income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities is as follows:


31 December

2020

2019


**Deferred tax assets:**

Deferred tax asset to be recovered after more than 12 months **1.749.825** 2.127.851

**Total deferred income tax assets** **3.087.128** 3.613.035

**Deferred tax liabilities:**

Deferred tax liability to be recovered after more than 12 months **-38.466.620** -33.554.835

Deferred tax liability to be recovered within 12 months **-5.954.418** -17.939.649

**Deferred tax assets/(liabilities) (net)** **-41.333.874** -47.881.450

The gross movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows:

Deferred income tax assets are recognized for tax losses carried forward, excluding unused notional interest deduction (NID), to
the extent that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is probable, i.e. in those companies
where, based on business projections over a period of 10 years, the company estimates that the losses can be utilized within this
timeframe.

All borrowings which are due within one year from the year-end date are classified as current borrowings, as well as the current
portion of long-term borrowings.

**(i) Borrowings**
Bank borrowings
During December 2017, the bank loans were refinanced with a new Senior Facility Agreement at the Corporate level with
variable interest rates. The carrying amount of the drawings, net of transaction cost, was EUR 456,9 million. The drawings
as per 31 December 2017 had 7 years of maturity and a variable interest rate based on Euribor plus a margin. In March 2018,
an additional tranche of EUR 125,00 million was withdrawn under the same terms.

In July 2019, the bank loans were refinanced with a new Senior Facility Agreement at Corporate level of EUR 550,00 million with
variable interest rates, together with an issuance of Senior Secured Notes of EUR 320,00 million. In August 2019 additional
Senior Secured Notes were issued of EUR 50,00 million.

In December 2020 Senior Unsecured Notes were issued of EUR 200,00 million.

These loans were initially measured at fair value, with subsequent measurement at amortized cost. The conditions for the new
loan issued in 2019 are similar to the proceeding loan. As a result, refinancing expenses relating to 2017 refinancing remain
capitalized and are amortized over the lifetime of the new loan. Additionally, refinancing expenses for the 2019 refinancing have
also been capitalized and are being depreciated over the lifetime of the loan. Financing expenses relating to the 2020 Senior
Unsecured Notes amount to EUR 5,85 million and have been capitalized. These are depreciated over the lifetime of the notes.

The Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes have an option for early repayment. These options has been valued at
EUR 4,08 million and EUR 0,35 million respectively at refinancing date, which is included in the fair value of the bank borrowings
and amortized over the lifetime of the notes. Refer to note 11 for more information on the repayment options.

Vendor loans
Vendor loans at 31 December 2020 relate to loans provided by shareholders of Covebo.

Shareholder’s loans
In 2018, a shareholder’s loan has been provided to Vialegis Group.

Current borrowings
Current borrowings relate to the current portion of bank loans payable within one year after the year-end date.

The maturity of borrowings is included in the liquidity section of Note 4.

Significant assumptions taken for the fair value calculations at initial measurement
For the majority of the borrowings, the fair values are not materially different to their carrying amounts since the interest payable
on those borrowings is either close to current market rates or the borrowings are of a short-term nature. The difference between
the fair value and carrying value in the table below for the bank loans is related to on the one hand paid transactions costs that
are reflected in the net book value, under the amortized cost method, and on the other hand the derivative on the Senior
(Un)Secured Note that was accounted for at fair value (refer to note 11).

**(ii) Financial covenants**
Under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Group is required to comply with the financial covenant that the
consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio must be not more than 6.0:1.

The Group has complied with this covenant throughout the reporting period. As at 31 December 2020, the consolidated senior
secured net leverage ratio of the Group (net debt to normalized EBITDA; i.e. EBITDA adjusted based on the SFA agreement)
was 3.60:1.

**(iii) Collateral for the Group’s bank borrowings**
For the bank loans in place (SFA loan agreements), multiple pledge agreements have been entered into which collectively
secure the bank borrowings for the entire amount outstanding and accrued interest on the bank borrowings. The Group is
subject to regular bank reporting, and leverage is monitored. In the event of a default of repayment of the bank borrowings
and related interest payments, the pledgee may enforce against the pledged assets. During the period under review, there
was no default of the payment obligations.

The present and future assets pledged as collateral include the following:

- All the shares of the HOHR and material subsidiaries;

- All bank accounts of the HOHR and material subsidiaries;

- All the intercompany loan receivables of the Group and material subsidiaries (excluding cash pooling).

We and our affiliates, or agents acting on our or their behalf, may retain, purchase, or sell for our own account any of our
outstanding publicly traded Notes, and may subsequently re-offer or re-sell any such Notes purchased. We do not intend
to disclose the extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory
obligation we may have to do so.

#### 18 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

The table below outlines the outstanding employee benefit obligations that were reported on the statement of financial
position:

Short-term employee benefits **138.946.354** 129.404.459

**Total amount of employee benefits** **144.920.719** 133.671.739

Total non-current employee benefits **3.116.375** 2.796.772

Total current employee benefits **141.804.344** 130.874.968

**Total amount of employee benefits** **144.920.719** 133.671.739

**18.1 Short-term employee benefits**
The amount of short-term employee benefits outstanding at the reporting date mainly relates to unpaid salaries and wages
as well as the related taxes on these amounts. The amounts both relate to salaries and wages for temping staff as well as the
permanent staff that is working for the Group.

**18.2 Post-employment employee benefits**
**(i) Pension plans**
The Group offers several defined contribution plans to its employees. Because of the Belgian legislation applicable to the
second pillar pension plans (the so-called “Wet op de Aanvullende Pensioenen”), all Belgian pension plans that are structured
as defined contribution plans are considered defined benefit plans under IFRS. Because of this minimum guaranteed return, the
Group is exposed to a financial risk since further contributions could be required if the return on the assets is not sufficient to
reach the minimum benefits to be paid. The Group has plans that are financed through insurance contracts. The Group carefully
reviewed the different pension plans at the different reporting periods and concluded that the application of the projected unit
credit method to calculate the defined benefit obligation would not result in a material amount to be accounted for on the
statement of financial position. No similar minimum funding exists in other countries where the Group is active.

The Group does not provide any material defined benefit plans to its employees.

**(ii) Disability benefits**
The Group also provides disability benefits to its employees which have similar terms and conditions as the defined contribution
plans and therefore also must be accounted for in a similar way. As the Group is insured for these disability benefits, no
provision has been accounted for by the Group.

**18.3 Termination benefits**
The termination benefits relate to:

1. Outstanding payables towards former employees, mainly key management. Refer to note 34 Related Parties for more
information.
2. The transition accrual in the Netherlands.

**18.4 Other long-term employee benefits**
Amounts reported for under the Other long-term employee benefits fully relate to jubilee premiums offered by the Group
rewarding employees for long years of service.

**(i) Jubilee benefits**

The impact of the remeasurements on the outstanding jubilee premium is accounted for in the statement of financial
performance.

#### 19 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

The share-based payments consist of the LTIP on the level of the shareholders of HOHR.

The Group launched a share-based payment plan throughout 2018 offering the management team to participate in a LTIP.
The purpose of the plan is to create an incentive for members of management and executives of the Group who can make an
important contribution to the success and the growth of the Group, to help the Group retaining and attracting managers with
the necessary experience and skills, and to align the interests of those managers with the grantors’ interests as shareholders of
the Company and give them the opportunity to share in the value creation and growth of the Group.

The term of the options runs from the grant date until 28 June 2023 for Belgian tax residents (5 years maximum vesting period).
For other beneficiaries, the term of validity is maximum 10 years.

The plan is settled in the ordinary shares of the Company. The option holder may exercise the options subject to the occurrence
of an exit event, a non-exit event or a good leaver event.

The plan contains several vesting conditions:

a. Service conditions – the beneficiary should have a contractual relationship with the group at the vesting date (in case
of an exit or a non-exit event) or qualify as a good leaver (in case of a good leaver event);
b. Performance conditions – the number of options that vest (and can be exercised) is determined at the vesting date and
depends on the return (or a deemed return) of the grantors on the initial value (effectively the increase in the fair value
of the shares of the Group since 31/12/2017).

This LTIP is comprised of 100 million share options, of which 75 million are granted during 2018, 12,5 million during 2019 and
12,5 million are still to be allocated. The share options are granted free of charge at the grant date. The fair value per share
option at grant date in 2018 amounts to €2,17 compared to the current exercise price of €1,53 after the capital reduction
of 2020 (note 15). For the shares granted in 2019, the fair value per share amounts to €1,33. The value of the shares has been
determined based on an EBITDA-multiple model (correcting for net debt) and is recognized in P&L based on the exit
probability. As the expected volatility of the people included in the plan has no impact on the total value, no assumption
was made in this respect. As a result of the accounting for the LTIP during the period, an expense has been recognized in the
income statement with a corresponding credit in equity in 2018 for EUR 13,95 million and EUR 4,65 million in 2019 and EUR
3,93 million in 2020.

The average contractual lifetime per end of December 2020 for the options amounts to 6,8 years. The corresponding weighted
average exercise price amounts to 2,06 EUR.

The value of the LTIP at grant date has been calculated based on the equity value of the entity, excluding the value of the
tracking shares.

The earn-outs to pay relate mianly to the Techmatch acquisition early 2020 refer to note 3.1.

Grants to be refunded
This concerns the accrual for the reimbursement of the governmental grant (NOW grant) received by Continu resulting from the
Covid-19 pandemic. As it is more likely than not that the criteria for obtaining this grant will not be met, a payable has been
recorded for the amount received (EUR 5,82 million).

#### 22 REVENUES

**22.1 Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers**

The Group mainly generates revenue from offering temporary staffing solutions to its customers. The duration of these
temporary staffing solutions may vary between a couple of hours up to a period of two years (without minimum volumes
attached to these contracts).

The Group also provides solutions to customers active in project-oriented businesses where apart from staffing also specific
deliverables have to be provided for. Projects may take one week up to two to three months.

The Group does not have a single major customer from which it generates revenue.

Although the Covid-19 pandemic started during the first quarter of 2020, the effect of the pandemic is mainly visible as from the
second quarter of the year, as governments have taken very strict measures to prevent the epidemy to spread further as from
mid-March 2020. These measures include social distancing, country wide quarantines, closing of non-essential business, and
many alike. Consequently, since mid-March 2020 the world economy has come to a stop and also the company’s key markets,
resulting in a slow-down of the Group’s activity. Governments have approved very strong support measures for businesses and
individuals, mainly focused in helping to adapt the workforce to the new reality and providing liquidity to companies (by
providing direct financing, guarantees to be used in front of financial institutions and delaying the payment of certain taxes).
During the third quarter of 2020, economy was slowly picking up. Unfortunately this has slowed down again in the last quarter of
2020 as Covid-19 measures were increasing again. The economic consequences of the decisions required to stop the spread of
the virus heavily impact 2020 performance of the Group. Although the Group has considered the Covid-19 pandemic in
preparing the 2020 financial statements, judgement is required in doing so. As a result, the final outcome of the pandemic is not
predictable, as the dept, duration, and recovery are as of today impossible to predict.

to business combinations done during the previous years. Refer to note 3.1 for more information.

The other gains contain, among others, indemnification for car damage, compensation of the credit insurance company and
gain on the sale of tangible and intangible assets.

#### 24 GRANTS

Covebo and Continu receive the LIV (“lage-inkomensvoordeel”) grant every year from the Dutch government, which is intended
to encourage employers to hire employees with a low wage. The amount received is a fixed fee for every hour worked by
employees with a wage within a certain range, that is defined by the government and indexed yearly. For 2020 the grant
amounts to 2,3 million EUR.

A receivable of 1,3 million EUR has been recorded in Accent for wages and training expenses of people at work that can be
reclaimed. The amount that can be reclaimed depends on the amount of training given to the people at work and the number
of people hired from risk groups. Accent also recorded a total 0,3 million EUR composed of different smaller grants.

In order to mitigate the impact of measures taken to prevent the spreading of Covid19, the Dutch government provided a grant
to support staffing costs, provided the company lost over 20% of its turnover in the comparable period in 2019. Covebo and
Continu applied for and received the grants, but will be required to pay them back, given the turnover decrease did not reach
20% for most entities. There is an outstanding debt recorded on the balance sheet of EUR 5,82 million.

In order to mitigate the impact of measures taken to prevent the spreading of Covid19, the French government provided a
grant to support staffing costs. From March till May, the company received a compensation for employees that were temporarily
unemployed of up to 90% of their wage. As from June this percentage increased to 15%. Abylsen received a total grant of EUR
3,2 million.

TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS receive the KUG (“Kurzarbeit”; translated to compensation for reduced hours) grants from the
German government only in case the sales drop with >10% on branch level. The amount received is depending on the total
reduced number of hours of the employee. Due to Covid19, TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS have requested these grants. For
2020 the grant amounts to EUR 10 million for TimePartner and EUR 744 thousand for ZAQUENSIS. As TimePartner is not certain
that all conditions are met, an outstanding debt is recorded on the balance sheet of EUR 0,5 million.

Considering the nature of the grants, all these grants are recorded as a deduction of payroll expenses.

#### 36 COVID19

Covid19 severely impacted economies worldwide – and the consulting and recruitment industry was certainly not immune.
In the main markets of House of HR (Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France), business restrictions and lockdowns led
to significant temporary reductions in clients’ activities and, hence, their demand for temporary employment and consulting
projects. After the first wave from March to April 2020, the situation began to get better, with activities recovering fast until the
second lockdown at the end of the summer. Growth slowed at this point, but did not stop. House of HR maintained a positive
EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) in every individual month of 2020. Looking ahead,
management believes House of HR is in a strong position to benefit from the expected recovery in 2021.

Although great progress has been made in the release of vaccines, the rates of vaccination continue to be moderate in terms of
% of the population protected, and therefore, the Covid19 pandemic is still considered as an uncertain factor in our day-to-day
business. At this point in time the duration of the pandemic and the impact on the financial results of the Group are difficult to
predict. Nevertheless, the vaccination programs will have a positive impact on the overall society and the world economy along
2021 and therefore on House of HR its business potential. The Board confirms that, based on the information currently available
the needs of the Group in the near term are covered and the Group will be able to fulfill its financial obligations for a period of
not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.

#### 37 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE

**Acquisitions**
The Group, via its subsidiary Continu, has acquired 100% of the shares in the Solyne group as per 15 January 2021. The Solyne
group is active as a specialist secondment provider of predominantly Dutch white-collar technical professionals, as well as
professionals in adjacent sectors, for clients active in the public and private domain, operating in the Netherlands a business
specialized in secondment, freelance, subcontracting and temporary staffing services for its clients. The consideration paid for
acquiring 100% of the shares amounts to EUR 34,16 million.

The Group, via its subsidiary Abylsen, has acquired 60% of the shares in the Greenworking group as per 26 January 2021. The
Greenworking is a consultancy firm active in the ‘new ways of working’ market group. By its services, mainly focusing on French
blue chip companies, Greenworking is adding value in the field of teleworking, work-life balance, leadership, digital change and
social responsibility. The consideration paid for acquiring the shares amounts to EUR 23,62 million.

**Segment reporting**
The Group has converted its three segment to two segments. The General Staffing and Specialized Staffing segments are
grouped as from 2021 to the Specialized Talent Solution segment. This does not have a financial impact on the 2020 financial
statements and mainly results in an adjustment of the Segment reporting.

**Repricing Senior Facility Agreement**
As per February 19, 2021 the Group has successfully repriced their Senior Facility Agreement, resulting in a 50 BPS reduction.
The total impact of the repricing amounts to EUR 13,07 million saving for the Group.

**Merger Germany**
The Group is in the progress of merging TimePartner and ZAQUENSIS. By merging, the Group wants to bundle the strengths
of each, and position the new group as the seventh largest staffing player in the German market with the ambition to further
specialize. This combination will help the Group to accelerate specialization and simplify the investment plans in Germany.

**HOUSE** **OF** **HR** **NV**

**Statutory auditor's report to the general**
**shareholders’ meeting on the consolidated**
**accounts for the year ended 31 December 2020**

**STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING OF**
**HOUSE OF HR NV ON THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED**
**31 DECEMBER 2020**

We present to you our statutory auditor’s report in the context of our statutory audit of the consolidated
accounts of House of HR NV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (jointly “the Group”). This report
includes our report on the consolidated accounts, as well as the other legal and regulatory
requirements. This forms part of an integrated whole and is indivisible.

We have been appointed as statutory auditor by the general meeting d.d. 20 June 2019, following the
proposal formulated by the board of directors. Our mandate will expire on the date of the general
meeting which will deliberate on the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2021. We have
performed the statutory audit of the Company’s consolidated accounts for 5 consecutive years.

**Report on the consolidated accounts**

**_Unqualified opinion_**

We have performed the statutory audit of the Group’s consolidated accounts, which comprise the
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2020, the consolidated income statement for the
period then ended and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement
of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes
to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information, and which is characterised by a consolidated balance sheet total of
EUR ‘000’ 1.767.351 and a net loss attributable to the shareholders of the parent company of EUR
‘000’ 15.970

In our opinion, the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the Group’s net equity and
consolidated financial position as at 31 December 2020, and of its consolidated financial performance
and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory
requirements applicable in Belgium.

**_Basis for unqualified opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in
Belgium. Furthermore, we have applied the International Standards on Auditing as approved by the
IAASB which are applicable to the year-end and which are not yet approved at the national level. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Statutory auditor’s responsibilities
_for the audit of the consolidated accounts” section of our report. We have fulfilled our ethical_
responsibilities in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
consolidated accounts in Belgium, including the requirements related to independence.

We have obtained from the board of directors and Company officials the explanations and information
necessary for performing our audit.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion

**_Key audit matters_**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
our audit of the consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the
context of our audit of the consolidated accounts as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets – Note 7 and 8**

Description of the key audit matter

House of HR carries a significant value of goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet
amounting to EUR 1.037 million as detailed in disclosure 7 and 8. Under the International Financial
Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS’s”), the Company is required to test the amount of
goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually. Other
assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable.

We consider this matter as a key audit matter because of the significance of the account and because
of the complexity of the assessment process, the significant judgments in respect of assumptions
about the future results of the business and the discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts.
The most important management assumptions relate to the discount rate, growth rates of revenue and
EBITDA margin.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

We challenged if the impairment test was performed at the level of the CGU (the smallest group of
assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of each other). We challenged the cash
flow projections used in the impairment tests and the process through which they were prepared. We
found that the projected cash flow for 2021 was consistent with the Board approved budgets, which
were subject to timely oversight and challenge by the Directors.

We have critically assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and evaluation of
business plans by comparing the prior year’s forecast with the Group’s actual performance. For the
cash flows after 2021, we critically assessed and checked the assumptions related to the long-term
growth rates, by comparing them to industry forecasts and historical growth rates.

We compared the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) to the cost of capital and debt of the
Group and comparable organisations, as well as considering territory specific factors. We tested the
calculation method used and the accuracy thereof. We compared EBITDA margin, working capitaland CAPEX percentage with past actuals. We challenged the adequacy of management’s sensitivity
analysis of the headroom. For all CGUs we calculated the degree to which these assumptions would
need to move before an impairment conclusion was triggered and found the likelihood of such a
movement to be unlikely.

Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the
Company’s discounted cash flow model and certain significant assumptions. We also assessed the
adequacy of the disclosures (Note 7 and 8) in the financial statements.

We found management’s judgments in respect of the impairment test to be within an acceptable range
of reasonable estimates.

**_Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated accounts_**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated accounts that give a true and
fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium, and for such internal
control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intend to liquidate the
Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**_Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these consolidated accounts.

In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to
the audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium. A statutory audit does not provide any assurance as
to the Group’s future viability nor as to the efficiency or effectiveness of the board of directors’ current
or future business management at Group level. Our responsibilities in respect of the use of the going
concern basis of accounting by the board of directors are described below.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

   - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.


-----

   - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors.

   - Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor’s report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

   - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated accounts,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated accounts represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

   - Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

**Other legal and regulatory requirements**

**_Responsibilities of the board of directors_**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the directors' report.

**_Statutory auditor’s responsibilities_**

In the context of our engagement and in accordance with the Belgian standard which is
complementary to the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium, our
responsibility is to verify, in all material respects, the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts
and to report on these matters.

**_Aspects related to the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts_**

In our opinion, after having performed specific procedures in relation to the directors’ report on the
consolidated accounts, this directors’ report is consistent with the consolidated accounts for the year
under audit and is prepared in accordance with article 3:32 of the Companies' and Associations' Code.


-----

**_Statements related to independence_**

- Our registered audit firm and our network did not provide services which are incompatible with the
statutory audit of the consolidated accounts, and our registered audit firm remained independent
of the Group in the course of our mandate.

- The fees for additional services which are compatible with the statutory audit of the consolidated
accounts referred to in article 3:65 of the Companies' and Associations' Code are correctly
disclosed and itemized in the notes to the consolidated accounts.
