1960,Offerings 2024.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"The financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). This offering memorandum includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: - with respect to each of Crash Champions Holdings and Service King, without giving effect to the Transactions, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, 4-Wall EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and 4-Wall EBITDA margin. We define these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: `o` EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization; `o` Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA as adjusted to exclude non-cash adjustments, transaction and integration-related costs, business optimization costs and non-recurring and normalization adjustments; `o` 4-Wall EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA generated by our facilities, but excluding all corporate-level costs; and `o` Adjusted EBITDA margin and 4-Wall EBITDA margin are defined as the applicable EBITDA figure divided by net sales for the corresponding period; - with respect to Crash Champions Holdings and Service King on a pro forma combined basis after giving effect to the Transaction Accounting Adjustments (as defined below), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, 4-Wall EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, 4-Wall EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Free Cash Flow. We define these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: `o` EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization; `o` Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA as adjusted to exclude non-cash adjustments, transaction and integration-related costs, business optimization costs and non-recurring and normalization adjustments; `o` 4-Wall EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA generated by our facilities, but excluding all corporate-level costs; `o` Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to reflect certain “run rate” benefits associated with acquisitions and investments made to expand our business as if they had been consummated as of the first day of the applicable period, cost savings and other adjustments that we will be permitted to include under the terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the notes; `o` Adjusted EBITDA margin and 4-Wall EBITDA margin are defined as the applicable EBITDA figure divided by net sales for the corresponding period; and `o` Pro Forma Free Cash Flow is defined as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures into existing stores. We believe that presenting these measures may help investors better understand the historical financial performance of Crash Champions Holdings and Service King in connection with their analysis of our business. We believe that EBITDA is useful to assess our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful financial metrics to assess operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. In addition, we believe that 4-Wall EBITDA and 4-Wall ----- EBITDA margin are useful financial metrics to assess the contribution of our locations excluding corporate-level costs. We also believe that Pro Forma Free Cash Flow is useful to assess our ability to generate cash. Historically, we have used these metrics for business planning purposes and in measuring performance relative to that of competitors. We present the adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, including adjustments to reflect the estimated “run rate” benefits associated with acquisitions and investments made to expand our business as if they had been consummated as of the first day of the applicable period, as well as integration benefits, as they are permitted as adjustments to “Consolidated EBITDA” under the indenture that will govern the notes. In addition to the reasons set forth in the preceding paragraph, we present Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to enable investors to understand the covenants that will apply to us. Neither Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA nor any related adjustment represents a projection of future results. We may be required to make significant cash expenditures as a result of future unforeseen costs, and these cash costs are not reflected in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment as a projection that we will achieve similar results in the future. In addition, the indenture governing the notes includes definitions of EBITDA-based metrics that are different from the definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and 4-Wall EBITDA used herein with respect to Crash Champions Holdings and Service King on a pro forma combined basis after giving effect to the Transaction Accounting Adjustments. We believe that the non-GAAP measures presented above are measures commonly used by securities analysts and investors to evaluate our performance and that of competitors and other leveraged businesses. Such non-GAAP measures are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or net income attributable to non-controlling interest or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or operating cash flows as measures of liquidity. Our use of such non-GAAP measures differs from others in our industry. The presentation of such nonGAAP measures in this offering memorandum should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. These measures have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, 4-Wall EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Free Cash Flow, whether presented in respect of Crash Champions Holdings, Service King or Crash Champions Holdings and Service King on a pro forma combined basis: - exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available; - do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; - do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and - do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, 4-Wall EBITDA and Pro Forma Free Cash Flow, whether presented in respect of Crash Champions Holdings, Service King or Crash Champions Holdings and Service King on a pro forma combined basis: - exclude various additional non-cash adjustments primarily driven by purchase accounting and lease accounting; - exclude certain one-time and non-recurring transaction and integration costs and expenses associated with shop acquisitions; ----- - add back non-recurring professional fees related to system implementations, training and other consulting fees, as well as one-time costs incurred to facilitate the attainment of the procurement synergies; and - reflect various normalization adjustments and adjustments for certain one-time costs in the applicable period. Further, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Free Cash Flow each reflect the estimated “run rate” benefits associated with acquisitions and investments made to expand our business as if they had been consummated as of the first day of the applicable period, as well as integration benefits. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Data of Crash Champions,” “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Data of Service King” and “Summary— Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” for additional information, as well as reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the applicable periods. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future— including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales, and statements expressing general or specific views about estimated or future operating results—are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements are assumptions and are inherently uncertain. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: - the impact of competition; - our ability to maintain our relationships with insurance carriers; - increases in labor costs, supply and other operating costs, interest rates and inflation; - supply chain shortages and interruptions and our reliance on key suppliers; - our ability to sustain our historic rates of growth, expand our business and improve our margins; - failure to benefit from future acquisitions; - our ability to protect our reputation; - our ability to comply with various laws and regulations and the costs of such compliance; - the impact of potential litigation; - our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; - material failure, interruption, security breaches or cyber incidents with respect to our information technology systems; - our insurance coverage may not address all of our potential exposures; - pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crisis; - our ability to raise capital in the future; - the effect of potential future changes to accounting rules or regulations; - the effect of our substantial indebtedness on our ability to raise additional capital to repay our debt obligations; - the restrictions imposed on our operating flexibility by the restrictive covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes and by the New Credit Agreement; ----- - our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to service all of our indebtedness; - conflicts of interests between affiliates of Clearlake and holders of the notes; - restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes without registration under applicable securities laws; - an active trading market may not develop for the notes; and - risks related to other factors discussed in this offering memorandum, including those described in “Risk Factors.” The information in this offering memorandum is not a complete description of our business or the risks and uncertainties associated with your investment in the notes.

This sentiment has served as the cornerstone of our DNA since Crash,9.1.1,,"Champions’ inception as a single Chicago-area repair facility in 1999. We are the largest founder-owned collision repair platform and one of the fastest growing multiple shop operators (“MSO”) in the United States, offering accident repair services including dent repair and removal, auto painting, bumper and fender damage repair and ancillary scanning and calibration services for internal combustion engine, hybrid and electric vehicles. Our inherently non-discretionary service offering addresses essential vehicle safety and functionality following a vehicle accident. We maintain longstanding relationships with all major insurance carriers, resulting in approximately 97% of our repair revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 coming from insurance-paid customers, of which approximately 90% is driven through Direct Repair Program (“DRP”) relationships, in which partner insurance carriers refer repairs to our shops. Since our founding in 1999, we have strategically expanded across the country through the execution of our national consolidation strategy, scaling to 619 facilities across 37 states as of October 2023. We have built a national presence through highly accretive acquisitions while simultaneously deploying our proven operational playbook to drive consistency of service quality as well as operational performance and efficiencies. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on our growing national footprint and drive attractive sales and earnings growth by providing quality service to the growing car parc in a highly resilient and fragmented industry. ----- Our differentiated platform is relentlessly committed to providing a consistent and superior customer experience in every part of the repair process. As a leading collision repair platform, we maintained over 6,700 DRP relationships nationwide and have achieved significant DRP expansion, growing our program count at a 21% CAGR in the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. Our DRP relationships prioritize our services due to our (i) expedited turnaround times, (ii) technical expertise and well-invested facilities, which enable us to repair all vehicle types (including those equipped with the latest advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”) and electric vehicle (“EV”) technology), (iii) superior customer satisfaction that helps drive policyholder retention for insurance carriers and (iv) ability to deliver lower overall vehicle repair costs. Collision Repair Cycle Under founder and CEO Matt Ebert’s leadership, our platform has achieved significant growth, expanding into 37 states and increasing our footprint by over 260 shops since 2018 (excluding Service King), representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 116% from 2018 to October 2023. This expansion has been a key contributor to our growth, and on a combined basis we have grown our net sales and Adjusted EBITDA by 32% and 173%, respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. In addition to increasing the number of locations that we operate, our net sales and Adjusted EBITDA growth has been driven by same store sales growth of 15% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 on a combined basis. The U.S. collision repair industry represents an estimated $44.8 billion non-discretionary and re-occurring revenue opportunity. The market is characterized by several long-term secular tailwinds, including steady car parc growth over the past decade, a consistent upward trend in vehicle miles traveled (“VMT”), and increasing accident severity driven by underlying increases in vehicle complexity. The U.S. collision repair industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 35,000 repair shops across the country, which are predominantly operated by regional, local and independent operators that lack the scale or resources to invest in the latest equipment and training required to repair the modern vehicle. The accelerating adoption of advanced vehicle technology is driving increased insurance carrier preference to refer repairs to national MSO platforms with the ability to invest in the ----- critical resources, including original equipment (“OE”) certifications and scanning and calibration services, required to repair the modern vehicle. MSO share of DRP appraised volume has increased from 11% in 2008 to 46% in 2022, according to CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc. In this highly fragmented industry, we believe that our combination of strategic organic growth investments and acquisition strategy uniquely positions us to expand our leadership as a national MSO platform.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

Having grown at a 5.1% CAGR from 2017 to 2022, the U.S. collision repair industry has a long track record of consistent growth, according to the Autocare Association Factbook 2024. The non-discretionary nature of collision repairs has insulated the industry from economic cycles and driven long-term, stable growth. In addition, vehicle insurance coverage is mandatory for all drivers in the U.S., further supporting the non-discretionary nature of collision repair demand. The drivers of industry growth are increasing VMT and traffic congestion, growing car parc, collision frequency and collision severity. Source: Romans Report. Despite significant advancements in safety technology, collision levels have increased 3% per year as miles driven have steadily increased, according to data published by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In addition, accident severity continues to accelerate collision repair service expenditures. Since 2010, the average total cost of repairs has increased at a 5% CAGR to approximately $4,300 per accident, and most recently at a 10% CAGR from 2020 to 2022. Increasing vehicle complexity results in the significantly higher average cost of repairs, with repair costs being driven by an increase in the number of parts replaced per claim, increased labor hours per claim, rising parts costs and increased demand for calibration and scanning services. Specifically, the average number of parts replaced and average labor hours per claim increased at a 4.3% and 1.5% CAGR, respectively, between 2011 and 2022. ----- Source: 2023 CCC Intelligent Solutions Report.

Following such transactions, while remaining separate legal entities, we integrated Service King’s operations into our Crash Champions platform to form the third largest national collision repair platform. Since the combination with Crash Champions, Service King has undergone a significant operational transformation, underscoring our commitment to enhance efficiency and sustainable growth consistent with Crash Champions’ history. We immediately aligned leadership under Crash Champions’ management team and deployed our proven operational playbook. We executed several operational improvements aimed at streamlining corporate functions, enhancing talent recruitment and retention, and enhancing shop-level performance through increased shop throughput. In addition to bringing talent back to the shops, we spent significant time with our carrier partners on a national, regional and local level to onboard more DRP programs, as well as to realize rate increases more commensurate with rising repair costs. We consolidated our procurement organizations to leverage our combined scale and enhance our gross margins and further augmented our 4-Wall EBITDA margins by right-sizing our frontof-shop labor and in-sourcing high-margin scanning and calibration services through ATE. We streamlined our corporate cost structure with Service King utilizing Crash Champions’ operations, human resources, business development, finance and IT functions to unlock significant annualized cost savings, and we harmonized our critical IT infrastructure by integrating our key systems. Finally, we are nearing completion of rebranding Service King shops as Crash Champions locations. Our successful integration execution has driven significant outperformance over and above the $45 million of underwritten synergies, with additional opportunities to realize meaningful embedded growth based on operational improvements and recruitment of technicians, exercising advantages of being a larger platform and capitalizing on compelling trends for larger, well-integrated MSOs. Since integrating Service King with Crash Champions in 2022, we have achieved 4-Wall EBITDA margin improvement at integrated Service King shops in excess of 350 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We continue to take action to advance both top and bottom-line performance through initiatives that we believe will continue to create earnings uplift with a target to improve our overall 4-Wall EBITDA margins from fiscal year 2023 margins by up to an additional 300 basis points over the medium term, the most important of which is increasing technician count to drive greater throughput. We are optimizing staffing levels through our recruitment programs and by developing talent internally through our Skills Training Education Program apprentice program. As we work towards reaching full staffing of technicians across our network where we have ample room for additional technicians, we expect to improve throughput at existing shops and drive additional fixed cost operating leverage to further improve 4-Wall EBITDA margins.

In 2018, the legacy Service King platform agreed to an uneconomical contract with Axalta to secure a paint pre-bate given limited access to traditional financing. Following the integration with Crash Champions, in June 2023, Service King entered into a newly negotiated paint procurement contract with BASF Corporation (“BASF”), and in August 2023 commenced the transition of all Service King location paint booths from Axalta to BASF (the “Paint Conversion”). As of December 31, 2023, we had transitioned paint booths at Service King locations representing in excess of 80% of Service King’s revenue to be consistent with paint booths at Crash Champions locations. The one-time costs associated with terminating the contract with Axalta and converting these facilities were $17.1 million, which comprises the majority of the EBITDA adjustments included in business optimization costs in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. We incurred the final costs associated with this transition in November 2023, which costs comprise the majority of the EBITDA adjustments included in business optimization costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. See “—Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” for additional information regarding these adjustments.

For a discussion of the adjustments applicable to items (i) through (viii), see note (1) in “—Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” (2) For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that, on a combined basis, our net sales were between $645 million and $650 million, gross profit was between $267 million and $269 million and selling, general and administrative expenses were between $219 million and $221 million. Although we continue evaluating certain components of our preliminary results, we expect to report an operating loss and net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 on both a combined basis and on a GAAP basis for each of Crash Champions and Service King. ----- (3) Calculated by subtracting the unaudited pro forma statements of operations data for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from the unaudited pro forma statements of operations data for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. See “—Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” We are continuing to recognize the benefit of our concentrated efforts to improve the combined Crash Champions and Service King business financially and operationally, and our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA profile continues to improve. On a pro forma combined basis, we estimate that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $7.1 million and $27.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 to between $42.0 million and $44.0 million and between $57.0 million and $59.0 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as we saw a meaningful decrease in integration-related expenses, as well as increased earnings from the continued ramp up of our growth investments in acquisitions, greenfield (“GF”) and brownfield (“BF”) facilities and ATE. In addition to certain non-cash items, the difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was driven primarily by (i) $2.0 million in costs that were accrued in respect of the Transactions and (ii) $1.9 million in costs related to the conversion of paint booths at Service King locations, as further discussed below, to improve profitability. Furthermore, pro forma fully ramped acquisitions includes an incremental $3.2 million of EBITDA contribution due to acquisitions completed during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. As a result, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $254.0 million and $256.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, pro forma adjustments as a percentage of the total Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA decreased to approximately 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 35.0% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

Founded in 1976, Service King grew from a single facility in Dallas, Texas to over 330 facilities spanning 24 states as of July 2022. Service King’s extensive footprint covers many of the nation’s fastest growing MSAs, including Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Seattle. Under prior management, Service King’s performance was negatively impacted by several factors including mismanagement of vendor relationships and an unsuccessful attempt to centralize operational processes, which ultimately led to attrition among body technicians and further strained shop throughput and financial performance. In July 2022, Clearlake executed a capital infusion into Service King to bolster its liquidity position and increase financial flexibility to reinvigorate growth and profitability. In August 2022, the Crash Acquisition Transaction was completed simultaneously with the operational combination of Crash Champions and Service King. Through this combination, Clearlake synergistically combined operations under the leadership of Crash Champions’ management team. We have been highly focused on the execution of several operational improvement initiatives, including (i) streamlined corporate functions promoting on-the-ground execution, (ii) increased shop-level autonomy, (iii) improved shop throughput and (iv) optimization of front-of-shop labor to drive operating leverage. By executing against Crash Champions’ operationally-focused playbook, we executed a comprehensive operational turnaround at Service King locations, attracted technicians back to the platform, deployed leadership training and development programs and drove improved procurement and parts margins through a national deal for aftermarket parts and “best-of-both” pricing from OEM parts providers. Furthermore, we enhanced shop-level performance by utilizing operational best practices to reduce claims disputes and rejections and implemented a comprehensive claims review process designed to ensure full reimbursement capture. These operational improvement initiatives in conjunction with improved shop-level throughput and profitability, improved carrier relationships and enhancements to Service Kings’ work environment to foster talent addition and retention, have driven significant outperformance compared to anticipated synergies. Today, all integrated shops leverage the Crash Champions playbook and are expected to fully complete rebranding in the first quarter of 2024. The following tables set forth summary historical financial data of Service King at the dates and for the periods indicated. The summary historical consolidated financial data as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been derived from the historical audited consolidated financial statements of New SK HoldCo Sub included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for those periods. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year.

We compete against a number of competitors in each of our markets, and the number, size and strength of competitors vary widely from region to region. Some of our competitors have a greater presence or operating history than we do in a particular market. We believe the core competitive factors in our industry are scale, geographic reach, reputation, service pricing, speed and quality, customer satisfaction, insurance carrier relationships and adherence to various insurance carrier key performance indicators. Certain of our competitors may have greater financial, operating, and other resources or may have stronger insurance carrier relationships, which may give them certain competitive advantages with respect to some or all of these areas of competition. We expect competition to continue to intensify as existing competitors continue to expand operations and new competitors emerge.

Our industry has experienced consolidation over time, in part reflecting insurance carriers’ increasing preference for regional or national DRP relationships. If the consolidation trend continues, we are likely to face greater competitive pressures in identifying suitable acquisitions and maintaining and building our DRP relationships in the markets in which we operate and into which we are seeking to expand, which could adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy. In addition, if our competitors are able to grow or consolidate more rapidly than we are, we may face greater competitive pressures with respect to our existing and new DRP relationships, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

For the year ended December 31, 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our top five insurance carrier relationships provided referrals representing 73% and 69% of our pro forma combined net sales, respectively. Many insurance carriers have specific methodologies that they use to determine repair referrals, which require us to meet certain minimum service levels, customer satisfaction levels and other benchmarks. If we fail to meet such requirements, we may not receive work from the insurance carriers. Further, our ability to continue to grow our business is driven by our ability to establish, maintain and grow our relationships with insurance 33 ----- carriers. The inability to establish, build or maintain our relationships with insurance carriers could materially and adversely affect our operations and business prospects. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of counterparties. There are also risks associated with the future level of demand for our collision repair services that will be referred to us by these insurance carriers or new insurance carriers, or the potential impact of the loss of one or more of these significant insurance carriers. Our DRP relationships are governed by agreements with insurance carriers that are usually cancellable upon short notice without penalty. These relationships can change quickly, both in terms of pricing and volumes, depending upon performance, claim cycle time, cost of total repair, customer satisfaction, competition, insurance carrier management and program changes and general economic activity. Insurance carriers may gain greater market power which may enable them to exert pressure on us to reduce prices and/or increase the key performance indicators specified in our DRPs. The loss or reduction of any existing material insurance carrier relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any of the insurance carriers from which we derive a large percentage of our revenue experiences a declining number of insureds due to market, economic or competitive conditions, we could be pressured to reduce the prices we charge for our collision repair services, which could adversely affect our margins and financial position and could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

In addition, we are not always able to pass these cost increases on to insurance carriers in the form of higher prices. As a result, there can be no assurance that increases in the costs to repair vehicles will ultimately be recoverable. While negotiations with insurance carriers and other factors can result in selling price increases over time, the timing and extent of such increases is uncertain.

Negative incidents can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation, undermine insurance carriers’ confidence in us, reduce demand for our services, affect our ability to recruit and retain employees, attract regulatory scrutiny, and impact our relationships with suppliers and vendors. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, environmental and anti-corruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups, employees or regulatory bodies.

The effectiveness of our due diligence review and ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence may depend upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the target companies or their representatives. As a result, we may not be able to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges.

If we are able to identify acquisition candidates, such acquisitions may be financed with a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. Although the use of leverage presents opportunities to increase our profitability, it has the effect of potentially increasing losses as well. If income and appreciation from acquisitions acquired through debt are less than the cost of the debt, the total return will decrease. Accordingly, any event which adversely affects the value of an acquisition will be magnified to the extent we are leveraged and we could experience losses substantially greater than if we did not use leverage. Increased indebtedness could also make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to any other debt agreements, increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and require that a greater portion of our cash flow be used to pay indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash available for other purposes, and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the collision repair services industries, which could place us at a disadvantage to competitors that have less debt. In addition, additional indebtedness may require us to agree to financial and other covenants that may limit our ability to make investments, pay dividends or engage in other transactions beneficial to our business, and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to lend funds or refinance existing indebtedness in the future. Our failure to comply with our covenants under such indebtedness could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in an acceleration of repayment of other existing indebtedness. Leveraged losses could adversely affect our ability to manage and support our locations, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

The successful development and operation of our locations depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations. Our locations’ operations are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments relating to safety standards, regulations and licensure requirements relating to motor vehicle repairs, federal and state labor and immigration law (including applicable equal pay and minimum wage requirements, overtime pay practices, reimbursement for necessary business expense practices, classification of employees, working and safety conditions and work authorization requirements), federal, state and local laws prohibiting discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the ADA, the Health Care Reform Act and applicable human rights and accessibility legislation, and subsequent amendments. In addition to the risk of adverse legislation or regulations being enacted in the future, we cannot predict how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Further, we cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any such laws or regulations. We are subject to the FLSA and similar state laws, which govern such matters as time keeping and payroll requirements, minimum wage, overtime, employee and worker classifications and other working conditions, along with the ADA, FMLA and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave, sick leave or other paid time off mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules, regulations and decisions promulgated or rendered, by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including labor scheduling, meal and rest periods, working conditions and safety standards. We have experienced and expect further increases in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage. In addition, our vendors may be affected by higher minimum wage standards, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to our locations. We expect increases in payroll expenses because of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage, and although such increases are not expected to be material, there can be no assurance that there will not be material increases in the future. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 9,900 employees on a combined basis, none of whom were represented by a union. As we continue to grow, unions may make attempts to organize all or part of our employee base or we may become party to collective bargaining agreements with unions in connection with future acquisitions. If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized, and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability, and could increase the likelihood of labor disruptions. In addition, responding to any organization attempts could distract our management and result in increased legal and other professional fees. Increased health care costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These various laws and regulations could lead and have led to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and lead to litigation claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury, loss or damage to personal property or business interruption losses, which could result in significant awards or settlements to plaintiffs and civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines.

These business activities are subject to stringent federal, regional, state, local and laws, by-laws and regulations governing the storage and disposal of these products and wastes, the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations upon our locations’ operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the imposition of restrictions on where or how to store and how to handle new products and to manage or dispose of used products and wastes, the incurrence of capital expenditures to limit or prevent releases of such material, the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our locations’ operations, and costs associated with workers’ compensation and similar health claims from employees. In addition, environmental laws and regulations have generally imposed further restrictions on our operations over time, which may result in significant additional costs to our business. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial and corrective action obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing operation of our locations.

We rely on these networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our business and the services we offer, as well as to manage and support our core business operations. Despite our security measures, we have been subject to attempted cyberattacks in the past and may continue to be subject to such attacks in the future. Although we and our service providers continually implement processes, procedures, and controls designed to reduce and mitigate the risk of a cyber incident, such preventative measures may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks. A successful cyber-attack or other cyber incident experienced by us or our service providers could cause an interruption of our operations, result in the exposure of private or confidential data, potentially resulting in litigation, and adversely impact our reputation and financial results. Although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured. For example, in May 2023, Service King had a cybersecurity issue affecting certain of its systems, in which criminal actors executed a ransomware attack, which resulted in system shutdowns that created operational disruptions at our Service King locations, adversely affecting revenues.

In the United States, this includes increased privacy related enforcement activity at both the federal level and the state level, including the implementation of the California Consumer Protection Act (the “CCPA”), which came into effect in January 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which modified the CCPA and came into effect in January 2023, and other state laws. As each state develops their own privacy law, it becomes increasingly challenging to conform to the states’ privacy laws, as each have different standards and requirements.

In particular, the full benefit of the actions that we have taken as a combined company to reduce costs, increase margins and accelerate growth that we ultimately realize may differ materially from our estimates. The estimates contained herein are our current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such estimates. Our ability to continue realizing the benefits associated with the adjustments included or permitted by the indenture that will govern the notes and the New Credit Agreement to be included when calculating “Consolidated EBITDA” and other non-GAAP financial measures depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors and customers, and general economic or industry conditions. Moreover, while we have made significant cash expenditures to achieve such benefits, we cannot assure you that additional investments beyond those cash expenditures we have already made will not be required. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of these adjustments in our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these benefits. Our ability to continue realizing these benefits is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. Our calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for estimated cost savings, margin improvements and growth opportunities that we have implemented on an annualized basis.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon a bankruptcy filing, secured creditors, such as the collateral agent, are prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor does not require compensation for diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of such collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the notes could be delayed following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent the holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, in the event a U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due in respect of the notes, the New Credit Agreement and any additional obligations of the Issuer or any guarantor secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis, the holders of the notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference. Generally, U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees for “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to any unsecured portion of the notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by a U.S. bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the Collateral as of the date of this offering memorandum exceeds the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the assets pledged as Collateral for the notes and the guarantees could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events. In addition, each of the indenture that will govern the notes and the New Credit Agreement will permit us, subject to certain conditions, to issue additional secured debt, including debt secured equally and ratably on the Collateral. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the notes and the guarantees and the obligations under the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest, fees and expenses may cease to accrue on the notes from and after the date such proceedings are commenced or initiated. To the extent that third parties enjoy prior liens on the Collateral securing the notes, to the extent permitted under the indenture that will govern the notes, such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral subject to such liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral. Additionally, Collateral securing the notes secures on a pari passu basis the obligations under the New Credit Agreement and the terms of the indenture will allow us to issue additional notes and other additional debt that may rank pari passu with the notes in certain circumstances. The indenture will not require that we maintain the current level of Collateral or maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values. Under the indenture, any such additional notes issued pursuant to the indenture or other additional debt incurred in accordance with the terms of the indenture will rank _pari passu with the notes and be entitled to the same rights and priority with respect to the Collateral. Thus, the_ issuance of any such additional debt may have the effect of significantly diluting your ability to recover payment in full of the notes from the then existing pool of Collateral. Releases of Collateral from the liens securing the notes will be permitted or required under certain circumstances. In the future, the granting of additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary or otherwise, will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Furthermore, upon enforcement against any Collateral or in insolvency, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement the claims of the holders of the notes to the proceeds of such enforcement or insolvency will rank equally with the claims of the holders of obligations under the New Credit Agreement, which are first-priority obligations, behind the claims of holders of any senior secured indebtedness that are senior in priority to the notes (to the extent permitted to have a prior lien on the Collateral by the indenture that will govern the notes). The security interest of the collateral agent is subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest ----- in a contract.

Service King is wholly owned by Carnelian, its ultimate parent. On May 27, 2022, SK Holdco and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an agreement for an out-of-court financial restructuring of SK Holdco and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the SK Restructuring Transaction, which closed on July 14, 2022, SK Holdco transferred all of the assets and obligations of Service King Paint & Body, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries to New SK Holdco Sub in exchange for a 100% equity interest in New SK Holdco Sub. In connection with the change in control event, New SK Holdco Sub elected to apply pushdown accounting, in which the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Carnelian, as well as the goodwill resulting from the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired was recognized by New SK Holdco Sub in its standalone financial statements. On August 1, 2022, Crash Champions Holdings completed a change of control event, which included the exit of its previous controlling interest holder, and Champions Purchaser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Carnelian, acquiring the majority interest in Crash Champions Holdings and effecting a merger that included the Company's non-controlling interest holders contributing net assets to Champions Purchaser or Carnelian, and extinguishing debt and certain other obligations. In connection with the change in control event, Crash Champions Holdings elected to apply pushdown accounting, in which the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champions Purchaser, as well as the goodwill resulting from the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired was recognized by Crash Champions Holdings in its standalone financial statements. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 and unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 are based on the individual historical consolidated financial statements, respectively, of Crash Champions Holdings and New SK Holdco Sub included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations give effect to the Crash Acquisition Transaction, the SK Restructuring Transaction, and the Transactions contemplated in this offering memorandum and described under the section entitled “Summary—The Transactions” (collectively, the “Transaction Accounting Adjustments”) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the Transaction Accounting Adjustments as if they had occurred on September 30, 2023. In this section, references to the use of the proceeds of the Transactions to repay indebtedness of Crash Champions Holdings refers to the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness of Crash Champions Intermediate, a wholly owned subsidiary of Crash Champions Holdings, which indebtedness is reflected in consolidated the financial statements of Crash Champions Holdings. The Transaction Accounting Adjustments set forth in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information were made to effect: - Such transactions, collectively referred to in this offering memorandum as the Reorganization, which result in the Issuer indirectly holding all of the equity interests of Service King and Crash Champions Holdings. Such transactions have all been determined to occur under the common control of Clearlake for accounting purposes. - Adjustments to reflect the pushdown accounting applied as an effect of the Crash Acquisition Transaction and the SK Restructuring Transaction. - The issuance of the notes in this offering and the Issuer’s entry into the New Term Loan Facility, and the use of the proceeds thereof for the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness of both Crash Champions Holdings and New SK HoldCo Sub. - The contribution of proceeds from the issuance of New PIK Preferred Equity by Parent to the Issuer, and the use of such proceeds for the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness of both Crash Champions Holdings and New SK HoldCo Sub. 67 ----- The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 does not include the Transaction Accounting Adjustments reflecting the pushdown accounting applied as a result of the Crash Acquisition Transaction and the SK Restructuring Transaction as such pushdown accounting is already reflected in the historical consolidated balance sheets of Crash Champions Holdings and New SK Holdco Sub, respectively.

We expect to receive approximately $650 million of gross proceeds in connection with this offering. We account for certain incremental costs directly attributable to this offering by capitalizing them and offsetting such costs against the gross proceeds of the offering. Such costs are comprised of accounting and advisory fees, underwriting discounts, legal fees, and other professional fees, and totaled $6.5 million. The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are comprised of the New Term Loan Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to incur approximately $650 million principal amount of new indebtedness related to the New Term Loan Facility. Debt issuance costs of $26 million incurred in connection with obtaining the New Term Loan Facility are offset against the carrying amount of the debt, and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the 5 year term of the New Term Loan Facility as a component of interest expense. The New Term Loan Facility is assumed to bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus 5% and requires annual principal payments equal to 1% of the original principal amount. For the New Revolving Credit Facility, debt issuance costs of $5.0 million are capitalized and recorded in other assets and will be amortized over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility on a straight-line basis as a component of interest expense. The New Revolving Credit Facility is assumed to bear interest at SOFR plus 5%. The New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to remain undrawn immediately subsequent to the Transactions. In addition, we expect to receive approximately $341.5 million as an equity contribution to the Issuer of the net proceeds from the issuance of the New PIK Preferred Equity by Parent. The gross issuance amount of $350 million is presented net of financing costs of $8.5 million incurred by Parent. The proceeds will be used for the repayment of approximately $1,543 million of the outstanding indebtedness of both Crash Champions Holdings and New SK HoldCo Sub, which includes the repayment of accrued interest as of September 30, 2023 of $1.0 million and $3.1 million related to the historical indebtedness of Crash Champions Holdings and New SK HoldCo Sub, respectively.

We provide services primarily to insured motorists and claimants under automobile insurance policies. The Company is headquartered in Westmont, Illinois, and operated 278 vehicle collision repair facilities throughout the United States immediately prior to the Crash Acquisition Transaction. Our non-discretionary service offering includes dent repair and removal, auto painting, bumper and fender damage repair, and ancillary scanning and calibration services for internal combustion engine, hybrid and electric vehicles. The Company’s unwavering commitment to superior customer service is characterized by trust, transparency and communication at every step of the repair process. On August 1, 2022, the Company completed a change of control transaction, referred to as the “Crash Acquisition Transaction,” which included the exit of the controlling interest holder. As a result of the transaction, Crash Champions’ ultimate parent became Carnelian, with Carnelian acquiring a majority interest in the Company through its subsidiary, Champions Purchaser. Pursuant to the Crash Acquisition Transaction and the SK Restructuring Transaction completed by Service King, both Crash Champions and Service King became indirect subsidiaries of Clearlake. Following such transactions, while remaining separate legal entities, we integrated Service King’s operations into our Crash Champions platform. Since the combination with Service King, our management has been highly focused on the execution of several operational improvements to optimize shop-level performance and increase shop throughput. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Crash Champions same store sales increased by $84.9 million, to $647.3 million, compared to $562.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

The 15.1% and 10.2% increases in same store sales across Crash Champions and Service King shops, respectively, were primary due to increased throughput as well as increased average repair pricing.

In connection with this offering and the other Transactions contemplated in this offering memorandum and described under the section entitled “Summary—The Transactions,” the Issuer, a newly formed Delaware corporation that will become the indirect parent of the Company, is expected to incur approximately $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of new indebtedness in the form of the New Term Loan Facility and the notes. Additionally, Champions Parent, Inc., the indirect parent of the Issuer, is expected to contribute the net proceeds from the issuance of New PIK Preferred Equity contemplated in this offering memorandum and described under the section entitled “Summary—The Transactions” to the Issuer. The proceeds from the New Term Loan Facility, the notes and the New PIK Preferred Equity will be used for, among other things, the repayment of $729.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, including accrued interest. The proceeds will also be used to pay call premiums, debt issuance costs, and non-capitalizable professional services, other advisory fees and transaction costs incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds” for additional information. The interest rates applicable to these contemplated debt obligations have yet to be determined. Based on an assumed annual interest rate of SOFR plus 5.0%, as well as amortization of debt issuance costs, we would expect the annual interest expense of the Issuer to be approximately $121.6 million. It is estimated that a one-eighth percentage change in the annual interest rate on the Issuer’s variable rate obligations would change annual interest expense by $0.8 million. In April 2023, the Company entered into two separate interest rate swap arrangements, each with a notional amount of $200.0 million, to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with interest rate payments related to its variable debt. The two swap arrangements have fixed rates of 4.03% and 4.06%, respectively. The two swap arrangements require quarterly settlements of the difference between the stated fixed rate and current variable rate, and mature on April 30, 2025.

The Company accounts for goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. Goodwill is not subject to amortization; rather, the Company tests goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 and whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to see if further testing of goodwill is required. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative test is required. For the quantitative test on goodwill, the income approach (discounted cash flow and market approach) is primarily used. Management makes significant assumptions regarding future sales trends, growth rates, expenses, tax considerations and discount rates. The guideline public company method is also employed, involving the selection of comparable companies and application of valuation multiples. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but assessed for impairment annually and when an event occurs, or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. The annual testing date is October 1. Regarding trade name intangible assets, a quantitative test is performed using the income approach. Key assumptions include future sales trends and discount rates applied to forecasted revenue streams. However, there is inherent uncertainty in forecasting future results, especially considering the reliance on economic conditions. Any decline in customer traffic or average repair order could reduce sales and impact overall profitability. This could affect the Company’s future cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

Estimating the fair value, especially for intangible assets, involves significant judgment, often requiring third-party valuation specialists for significant acquisitions. Real property and intangible assets, such as trade names, are valued based on historical information, expectations and assumptions about the future from the perspective of marketplace participants. In the case of acquired leases, a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease obligations are recorded at the present value of remaining lease payments, adjusted for market terms.

Goodwill is not subject to amortization; rather, the Company tests goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 and whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to see if further testing of goodwill is required. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative test is required. For the quantitative test on goodwill, the income approach (discounted cash flow and market approach) is primarily used. Management makes significant assumptions regarding future sales trends, growth rates, expenses, tax considerations and discount rates.

Our inherently non-discretionary service offering addresses essential vehicle safety and functionality following a vehicle accident. We maintain longstanding relationships with all major insurance carriers, resulting in approximately 97% of our repair revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 coming from insurance-paid customers, of which approximately 90% is driven through Direct Repair Program relationships, in which partner insurance carriers refer repairs to our shops. Since our founding in 1999, we have strategically expanded across the country through the execution of our national consolidation strategy, scaling to 619 facilities across 37 states as of October 2023. We have built a national presence through highly accretive acquisitions while simultaneously deploying our proven operational playbook to drive consistency of service quality as well as operational performance and efficiencies. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on our growing national footprint and drive attractive sales and earnings growth by providing quality service to the growing car parc in a highly resilient and fragmented industry. Our differentiated platform is relentlessly committed to providing a consistent and superior customer experience in every part of the repair process. As a leading collision repair platform, we maintained over 6,700 DRP relationships nationwide and have achieved significant DRP expansion, growing our program count at a 21% CAGR in the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. Our DRP relationships prioritize our services due to our (i) expedited turnaround times, (ii) technical expertise and well-invested facilities, which enable us to repair all vehicle types (including those equipped with the latest advanced driver assistance systems and electric vehicle technology), (iii) superior customer satisfaction that helps drive policyholder retention for insurance carriers and (iv) ability to deliver lower overall vehicle repair costs. 104 ----- Collision Repair Cycle Under founder and CEO Matt Ebert’s leadership, our platform has achieved significant growth, expanding into 37 states and increasing our footprint by over 260 shops since 2018 (excluding Service King), representing a CAGR of 116% from 2018 to October 2023. This expansion has been a key contributor to our growth, and on a combined basis we have grown our net sales and Adjusted EBITDA by 32% and 173%, respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. In addition to increasing the number of locations that we operate, our net sales and Adjusted EBITDA growth has been driven by same store sales growth of 15% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 on a combined basis. The U.S. collision repair industry represents an estimated $44.8 billion non-discretionary and re-occurring revenue opportunity. The market is characterized by several long-term secular tailwinds, including steady car parc growth over the past decade, a consistent upward trend in vehicle miles traveled, and increasing accident severity driven by underlying increases in vehicle complexity. The U.S. collision repair industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 35,000 repair shops across the country, which are predominantly operated by regional, local and independent operators that lack the scale or resources to invest in the latest equipment and training required to repair the modern vehicle. The accelerating adoption of advanced vehicle technology is driving increased insurance carrier preference to refer repairs to national MSO platforms with the ability to invest in the critical resources, including OE certifications and scanning and calibration services, required to repair the modern vehicle.

We consolidated our procurement organizations to leverage our combined scale and enhance our gross margins and further augmented our 4-Wall EBITDA margins by right-sizing our frontof-shop labor and in-sourcing high-margin scanning and calibration services through ATE. We streamlined our corporate cost structure with Service King utilizing Crash Champions’ operations, human resources, business development, finance and IT functions to unlock significant annualized cost savings, and we harmonized our critical IT infrastructure by integrating our key systems. Finally, we are nearing completion of rebranding Service King shops as Crash Champions locations. Our successful integration execution has driven significant outperformance over and above the $45 million of underwritten synergies, with additional opportunities to realize meaningful embedded growth based on operational improvements and recruitment of technicians, exercising advantages of being a larger platform and capitalizing on compelling trends for larger, well-integrated MSOs. Since integrating Service King with Crash Champions in 2022, we have achieved 4-Wall EBITDA margin improvement at integrated Service King shops in excess of 350 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We continue to take action to advance both top and bottom-line performance through initiatives that we believe will continue to create earnings uplift with a target to improve our overall 4-Wall EBITDA margins from fiscal year 2023 margins by up to an additional 300 basis points over the medium term, the most important of which is increasing technician count to drive greater throughput. We are optimizing staffing levels through our recruitment programs and by developing talent internally through our Skills Training Education Program apprentice program. As we work towards reaching full staffing of technicians across our network where we have ample room for additional technicians, we expect to improve throughput at existing shops and drive additional fixed cost operating leverage to further improve 4-Wall EBITDA margins. Our successful integration of Service King has been a significant driver of earnings growth which we believe still presents a significant opportunity. 112 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

From the date of the Crash Acquisition Transaction through October 31, 2023, we added 89 shops through acquisitions and new developments. The collision repair industry remains highly fragmented and by focusing on accretive acquisitions with attractive unit economics and synergies, we expect to continue to drive attractive long-term returns. While acquisitions often require larger initial capital outlays than greenfield and brownfield developments, acquired units bring immediate cash flow through an established labor force and customer base that we are able to augment via increased DRP volumes. Through our long history of successful M&A, we have developed a defined Crash Champions playbook that takes new facilities from pre-acquisition announcement through their first 30 days, bringing acquired locations seamlessly into the Crash Champions ecosystem through implementation of best practices and standardization with existing shops with our Quick Response Force. From small-scale, single-facility acquisitions to our transformative merger with Service King, we believe that our ability to successfully acquire and integrate new facilities provides us with a competitive advantage. By leveraging the improvements enabled by our operating playbook as well as the revenue growth through the addition of DRPs, we historically have recognized significant multiple buy-down within 24 months following an acquisition. Our underwriting of the 2020 and 2021 cohorts, inclusive of cost synergies, indicates a 4.8x and 5.5x multiple,[3] respectively, on acquired shops with an opportunity to realize greater upside over a longer period. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, estimated annualized EBITDA for the same cohorts indicates a 2.7x and 4.3x multiple, respectively. [4] As of September 30, 2023, we have exceeded our underwriting models for both cohorts, demonstrating our ability to execute on realizing cost synergies and to create value through meaningful volume increases at acquired shops within 24 months. Additionally, selective greenfield and brownfield development enables us to infill existing markets and build density. The addition of greenfield and brownfield units allows us to (i) leverage our strong carrier partnerships to drive immediate volume, (ii) capitalize on our scale procurement, and (iii) leverage our existing regional infrastructure. Our ability to pursue greenfield and brownfield development, complemented by our M&A track record, puts us in a leading position to scale our platform in an accretive manner.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

Upon the commencement of a case for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “Bankruptcy Code”), a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security without bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). In view of the lack of precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of Post-Petition Interest (including costs and attorneys’ fees) to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (and all other obligations secured by a first lien on the Collateral), the Holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

At any time prior to       , 2026, the Company may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes) during any twelve-month period at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder 132 ----- (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by the Company or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “— Selection and Notice” below. Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Company in its discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

1960,Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.4,Change of Control,21.4.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless a third party makes a Change of Control Offer or the Company has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive the interest due on the repurchase date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of compliance therewith. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Credit Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. 134 ----- The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. As described below, under certain circumstances Minority Business Assets shall not at any time be deemed to constitute “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

The Notes Liens and the Collateral will be released during the Suspension Period to the extent provided in “—Release of Liens” and subject to the proviso thereto. If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “— Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, any future obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be released. All such obligations to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. 136 ----- On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

(10) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions), in each case, at the option of the Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture 142 ----- shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreement (or other relevant definitive documentation) for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event or the date of any notice, which may be conditional, of such a repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is given to the holders of such Indebtedness), or (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent announcement in another jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and any related pro forma adjustments, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed, issued, assumed or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided, that (X) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (Y) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (X), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and (Z) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or Total Assets of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any applicable exchange rate utilized in calculating compliance with any dollar-based provision of the Indenture changes from the LCT Test Date to the date of consummation of such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, such change will not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether any Indebtedness or Lien that is being incurred in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness complies with any such dollar-based provision of the Indenture, or in connection with compliance by the Company or any Guarantor with any other provision of the Note Documents or any other transaction undertaken in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness; (3) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (4) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for 143 ----- redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction; (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors. 144 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Company be permitted under the provisions of the Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Company’s financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Company for any period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, the Company may contribute Capital Stock of any or all of its Subsidiaries to any Guarantor. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. 168 ----- A sale, lease or other disposition by the Company of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of the assets retained by the Company exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Company that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with respect to such assets. Such fair market value may, at the election of the Company, be established by the delivery to the Trustee of an independent expert’s certificate stating the independent expert’s opinion of such fair market value as of a date not more than 90 days before or after such sale, lease or other disposition. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Company’s sales, leases or other dispositions of less than substantially all of its assets.

However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the Default (with a copy to the Trustee if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clauses (3) or (6), the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (3) or (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders and the Trustee, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that 170 ----- have represented to such Holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Default, Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default shall be remedied 171 ----- or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is known to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly 172 ----- prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the notice provisions in the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on any ratio based exceptions, thresholds and baskets, such ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or other transaction without giving effect to amounts being utilized under any other exceptions, thresholds or baskets (other than ratio based baskets) on the same date. Each item of Indebtedness that is incurred or issued, each Lien incurred and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, issued or taken first, to the extent available, pursuant to the relevant ratio based test. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on any ratio based exceptions, thresholds and baskets, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the incurrence of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (1) immediately prior to or in connection therewith or (2) used to finance working capital needs of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. 202 ----- The Indenture shall provide that any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to the Company’s financial statements (including Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Income, Fixed Charges, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio) may be determined with reference to the financial statements of a Parent Entity instead, so long as such Parent Entity does not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Capital Stock of the Company. For purposes of making any computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansions and disposed or discontinued operations that have been made by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to the reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the applicable Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansions and disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business expansion or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the applicable ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the reference period. For purposes of any ratio calculation, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Company (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expenses reductions and synergies resulting from such transactions which is being given pro forma effect). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness).

Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate. “Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of (without duplication): (1) Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period; (2) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series of Preferred Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary of such Person during such period; and (3) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series of Disqualified Stock of such Person during such period. “Foreign Subsidiary” means, with respect to any Person, any Subsidiary of such Person that is not organized or existing under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, and any Subsidiary of such Subsidiary. “FSHCO” means any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company, substantially all of the assets of which consist (directly or indirectly through disregarded entities or partnerships) of: (i) Equity Interests (including, for this purpose, any debt or other instrument treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as determined by the Company)) or (ii) Equity Interests (including, for this purpose, any debt or other instrument treated as equity for 203 ----- U.S. federal income tax purposes (as determined by the Company)) and indebtedness, in either case of clauses (i) and (ii), in one or more CFCs and/or one or more other FSHCOs. “GAAP” means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America set forth in the opinions and pronouncements of the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and statements and pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or in such other statements by such other entity as have been approved by a significant segment of the accounting profession, which are in effect from time to time; provided that all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Indenture shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture shall be made (a) without giving effect to any election under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825—Financial Instruments, or any successor thereto or comparable accounting principle (including pursuant to the Accounting Standards Codification), to value any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein and (b) the amount of any Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations shall be determined in accordance with the definition of Capitalized Lease Obligations.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Non-U.S. plans, U.S. governmental plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (as discussed below), may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the notes to determine the suitability of the notes for such plan and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. In addition, a fiduciary should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, initial purchasers, or guarantors, or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”), will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold notes and none of the Transaction Parties is undertaking to provide any advice, including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. The purchase and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the purchase and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 9560 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. ----- Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering purchasing and/or holding the notes in reliance of these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Issuer takes no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised the Issuer that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship ----- with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised the Issuer that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium on, if any, on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the ----- payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Issuer and the trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositaries for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer, the trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. _Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes_ A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if: (1) DTC (a) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and, in either case, the Issuer fails to appoint a successor depositary within 90 days after its receipt of such notice or its becoming aware of such cessation; (2) the Issuer, at its option, and subject to DTC procedures, notifies the trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the Certificated Notes; provided that in no event shall the Regulation S Temporary Global Note be exchanged for Certificated Notes prior to (a) the expiration of the Restricted Period and (b) the receipt of any certificates required under the provisions of Regulation S; or ----- (3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes. In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written notice given to the trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law. _Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes_ Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” _Exchanges Between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes_ Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only if: (1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and (2) the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that the notes are being transferred to a Person: (a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A; (b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and (c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream. Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC participant through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period. ----- _Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes_ A holder of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes must provide Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the indenture certifying that the beneficial owner of the interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that has purchased such interest in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, and Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the trustee (or the paying agent if other than the trustee) a certificate in the form required by the indenture, prior to any exchange of such beneficial interest for a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Permanent Global Notes. _Same Day Settlement and Payment_ The Issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its nominee. The Issuer will make all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised the Issuer that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

Our obligations to make such payments may implicate the provisions of U.S. Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” One or more contingencies will not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments if, as of the issue date, such contingencies, individually or in the aggregate, are remote or incidental. In addition, these special rules do not apply where a debt instrument provides for alternative payment schedules applicable upon the occurrence of one or more contingencies, including an unconditional option held by the issuer or holder, and the timing and amounts of the payments that comprise each payment schedule are known as of the issue date, in which case the option will be deemed to be exercised in a manner that maximizes (in the case of an option held by the holder) or minimizes (in the case of an option held by the issuer) the yield on the notes. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we believe and intend to take the position that the possibility of these payments does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. Our position is binding on an investor in the notes unless such investor explicitly discloses to the IRS in its timely filed tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenges this position, and the notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments, an investor subject to U.S. federal income taxation might, among other potentially adverse tax consequences, be required to accrue interest income on the notes based on a “comparable yield” (as defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations) in excess of the stated interest rate and to treat any gain recognized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income ----- rather than as capital gain.

Subject to the below discussions of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax under the “portfolio interest exemption,” provided that: - such Non-U.S. Holder does not own directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of the Issuer within the meaning of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations; - such Non-U.S. Holder is not a “controlled foreign corporation” as described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code that is related to the Issuer actually or constructively through ownership rules under Section 864(d)(4) of the Code; - such Non-U.S. Holder is not a “bank” (within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code) that acquired the notes in consideration for an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; - such interest is not effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business within the United States; and - with respect to withholding, the relevant withholding agent receives appropriate documentation (generally an IRS Form W-8BEN-E, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8ECI (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) that has been properly completed and duly executed under penalties of perjury) establishing that the Non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person (note that special certification rules apply to Non-U.S. Holders that are passthrough entities rather than corporations or individuals). A Non-U.S. Holder that does not qualify for an exemption from U.S. federal income and withholding tax under the preceding paragraph generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate on payments of interest on the notes, unless such Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly ----- executed (i) IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or other applicable form or a suitable substitute or successor form as the IRS may prescribe), establishing an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty, or (ii) IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form or a suitable substitute or successor form as the IRS may prescribe) stating that interest paid on the notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

This summary is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), judicial decisions, final, temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code and other applicable authorities, all as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to changes subsequent to the date of this offering memorandum, which may have retroactive effect that could adversely affect the tax consequences below. As a result, the tax considerations of purchasing, owning, or disposing of the notes could differ from those described below. Persons considering the purchase of notes are urged to consult their tax advisors with regard to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under other federal tax laws (such as federal estate and gift tax laws or the net investment income tax on certain investment income) or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. We have not sought, nor do we expect to seek, any rulings from the IRS with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes or that any such position would not be sustained. _The following summary is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. Investors considering the purchase of notes should consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of the United States federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under any other United States federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-United States taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable income tax treaty._",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,3308.9.4,Revenue Recognition,"The Company derives its revenue primarily from automotive collision repair services and uses the five-step model for contracts with customers as follows: �Identify the contract with a customer �Identify the performance obligations in the contract �Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer �Allocate the transaction price among the separate performance obligations within the contract �Recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied Sales to customers are primarily from Direct Repair Programs with various insurance companies. Revenue from three insurance companies constitutes approximately 51% and 51% of the Company�s revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. From time to time, the company collects cash from self-pay customers upon completion of services, no payment terms are offered. Sales are recorded net of discounts, sales incentives and rebates, sales taxes, and estimated allowances. The Company estimates the reduction to sales and cost of sales for allowances based on current sales levels and our historical experience. Such amounts are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes revenue over time and uses the input method based on the labor hours on the repair orders as a percentage of total labor hours at the time of order completion to estimate the revenue on the in-process vehicles. The Company recognizes revenue ratably because the company�s performance enhances a customer-controlled asset. The Company�s contracts are generally noncancelable. The Company also recognizes contract assets, primarily relating to the ratable consideration for services completed for the in-process vehicles, that are not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets are classified as receivables when the Company has the right to invoice the customer. The Company, from time to time, receives prepayments from insurance companies for repair orders that are open at the end of a financial period where customers have not yet taken possession of their vehicle. The amounts are recorded as customer deposits and are reported in current liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company�s costs incurred in the fulfillment of the repair services included labor, parts, and paint costs, and other expenses such as waste disposals, shop supplies and towing costs. The Company capitalizes costs incurred to fulfill the repair services since they are directly related to the contracts that can be specifically identified, incurred to generate, or enhance the resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future, and expected to be recovered. The Company accounts for vendor rebates as a reduction of the cost of products purchased. The Company provides warranty for labor for all the vehicles the Company services, as parts warranty is generally provided by manufacturers. Warranty claims are minimal based on historical data, and therefore the Company has not recognized a liability as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

The fair value of property and equipment, at acquisition, is estimated using a hybrid of cost and market valuation methodologies. All other purchases are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Construction in progress is also recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the standard life of the type of asset or the remaining life of the lease, whichever is shorter. Equipment held under capital leases is stated at the lower of the fair value of the asset or the net present value of the future minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease. For equipment held under capital leases, depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the leased assets or the related lease term and is included within depreciation expense. The following represents the estimated lives of property, plant, and equipment: Land Indefinite Building 30 years Leasehold improvement Lesser of lease or useful life of the asset Machinery and equipment 3 � 15 years Computers and office equipment 3 � 5 years Vehicles 3 � 5 years Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Property, plant, and equipment is evaluated for impairment at the asset group level. If a triggering event suggests that a potential impairment has occurred, recoverability of these assets is assessed by evaluating whether or not future estimated undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the assets are written down to their fair value through an impairment loss recognized as a non-cash component of �Operating income (loss)� within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

If a triggering event suggests that a potential impairment has occurred, recoverability of these assets is assessed by evaluating the probability that future estimated undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. If the estimated cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived assets, the assets are written down to their fair value through an impairment loss recognized as a non-cash component of �Operating income (loss)� within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company did not record an impairment charge for the years ended December 31, 2021, or 2020. Refer to Note 5 for additional information.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,3308.9.11,Goodwill,"The Company accounts for goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. In addition, as the result of the Company�s intangible assets alternative accounting policy, intangible assets such as customer relationships and non-compete arrangements are subsumed into goodwill. As a requirement of this accounting policy, the Company amortizes goodwill on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period, and tests for impairment at the entity level instead of the reporting unit level. The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount is determined as not recoverable, the Company conducts impairment testing at the entity level. If the estimated fair value of the entity exceeds the carrying value, the Company considers that goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an impairment of goodwill and an impairment loss is recognized. The Company calculates the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the entity less the carrying amount, including goodwill. Goodwill impairment would be limited to the carrying value of the goodwill. There were no impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,3308.9.17,Income Taxes,"Income taxes are provided on income reported for financial statement purposes, adjusted for permanent differences between financial statement reporting and income tax regulations. A valuation allowance is established whenever management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets may not be realizable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The realization of the net deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on estimated future taxable income. A change in the Company�s estimate of future taxable income may require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance. A liability for uncertain tax positions is recorded whenever management believes it is not more-likely than-not the position will be sustained on examination based solely on its technical merits. Interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes are classified as income tax expense. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company has to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, voluntary settlements, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Crash Champions Intermediate, LLC is a single-member disregarded entity. HoldCo has elected to be treated as a Limited Liability Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, which provides that, in lieu of corporate income taxes, the members separately account for their pro rata share of the Company's items of income, deductions, losses, and credits. As of December 31, 2021, for federal income tax purposes the Company was comprised of the following regarded entities: Crash Champions Midco, LLC (�MidCo LLC�), Prestige Too Holdings, Inc. (�Prestige Inc.�), and Fountain Valley Bodyworks, Inc. (�Fountain Valley Inc.�). MidCo LLC is a multimember LLC taxed as a partnership for federal tax purposes and files a federal Form 1065 and state and local LLC income tax returns in jurisdictions where Midco LLC has income tax nexus. Prestige Inc. and Fountain Valley Inc. are C corporations that file federal Form 1120s and California C corporation income tax returns. During 2021, the Company completed asset acquisitions. The acquired assets are wholly-owned by MidCo LLC and are subject to various pass through entity taxes, however, the income and losses of these entities are flowed through to the members of Midco. The Company recognizes the tax benefit associated with the tax positions taken for tax return purposes when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained. The Company does not believe there are any material uncertain tax positions and accordingly it has not recognized any liability for unrecognized tax benefits and as such has not recorded any interest and penalties for the year ended December 31, 2021 and period ended December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,3308.9.18,Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements,"In August 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (�FASB�) issued Accounting Standard Update (�ASU�) No. 2021-08, _Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The amendments in this Update require that_ an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. To achieve this, an acquirer may assess how the acquiree applied Topic 606 to determine what to record for the acquired revenue contracts. Generally, this should result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquiree�s financial statements (if the acquiree prepared financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles [GAAP]). However, there may be circumstances in which the acquirer is unable to assess or rely on how the acquiree applied Topic 606, such as if the acquiree does not follow GAAP, if there were errors identified in the acquiree�s accounting, or if there were changes identified to conform with the acquirer�s accounting policies. In those circumstances, the acquirer should consider the terms of the acquired contracts, such as timing of payment, identify each performance obligation in the contracts, and allocate the total transaction price to each identified performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis as of contract inception (that is, the date the acquiree entered into the contracts) or contract modification to determine what should be recorded at the acquisition date. The amendments in this Update also provide certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing and measuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption of F-40 ----- amendments (1) retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application and (2) prospectively to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of initial application. The Company early adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021, and it did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-03, Accounting Alternative for Evaluating Triggering Events. The amendments in this Update provide private companies and not-for-profit entities with an accounting alternative to perform the goodwill impairment triggering event evaluation as required in Subtopic 350-20 as of the end of the reporting period, whether the reporting period is an interim or annual period. An entity that elects this alternative is not required to monitor for goodwill impairment triggering events during the reporting period but, instead, should evaluate the facts and circumstances as of the end of each reporting period to determine whether a triggering event exists and, if so, whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. An entity that does not elect the accounting alternative for amortizing goodwill and that performs its annual impairment test as of a date other than the annual reporting date should perform a triggering event evaluation only as of the end of the reporting period. The amendments in this Update are effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance as of March 30, 2021.

This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to general principles in Topic 740 and clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for (1) public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) all other entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. An entity that elects to early adopt the amendments in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. The amendments are applied on a prospective or retrospective basis, depending upon the amendment adopted within this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this adoption will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, _Financial Instruments�Credit Losses (Topic 326), and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in May 2019 within ASU No. 2019-05 and in November 2019 within ASU Nos. 2019-10 and 201911. This standard sets forth an expected credit loss model which requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial instruments based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures. For public entities, the updated standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

Early adoption is permitted, and the standard is adopted using a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in September 2017 within ASU No. 2017-13, in January 2018 within ASU No. 2018-01, in July 2018 within ASU Nos. 2018-10 and 2018-11, in December 2018 within ASU No. 2018-20, in March 2019 within ASU No. 2019-01, in November 2019 within ASU No. 2019-10, in June 2020 within ASU No. 2020-05, and in September 2021 in ASU No. 2021-09. This standard requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. For public entities, the updated standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. This standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. This standard provides the option to adopt through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption, instead of applying the new guidance retrospectively for each prior reporting period presented.

The purpose of the Plan is to encourage and enable the officers, employees, directors, managers, consultants and other key persons of the Company and its Subsidiaries, upon whose judgment, initiative, and efforts the Company largely depends for the successful conduct of its business, to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. The Incentive Units reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be Class B Units of Crash Champions Holdings, LLC. The maximum number of Units reserved and available for issuance under the Plan shall be 3,176 Class B Units. The Units underlying any Awards that are forfeited, canceled, reacquired by prior to vesting, or otherwise terminated shall be added back to the Units available for issuance under the Plan.

In the Monte Carlo simulation, the Class B Units price is assumed to follow a Geometric Brownian Motion. Geometric Brownian Motion formula was utilized to estimate the monthly Class B Units until the change of control event. Management projected that the Company is expected to undergo a change of control event in approximately five years from July 31, 2019. The model checks for the vesting conditions at the time of liquidity event and calculates the distributions accordingly. The simulation model requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation. These variables and assumptions include the weighted-average period of time that the Incentive Units granted are expected to be outstanding, the volatility of the Class B Units, the risk-free interest rate. Since its stock has no trading history, the Company used the simplified calculation of expected term, and the Company estimated its stock volatility based on an average of the historical volatilities of several entities with characteristics similar to the Company. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its borrowing arrangements and obligations. The Company regularly monitors the financial stability and credit standing of the counterparties to derivative instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company enters into interest rate contracts to provide predictability in the Company's overall cost structure and to manage the balance of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. The Company records all derivatives at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as one of the following: a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid (“Cash Flow Hedge”), a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“Fair Value Hedge”), or an undesignated hedge instrument. The Company had no derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022 (Successor). As of September 30, 2023 (Successor), all of the Company’s derivative instruments were interest rate caps, and none are designated as hedge instruments. The Company entered into two separate interest rate swap arrangements, each with a notional amount of $200.0 million and an effective date of April 28, 2023, to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with interest rate payments related to its variable debt. The two swap arrangements have fixed rates of 4.03% and 4.06%, respectively. The two swap arrangements require quarterly settlements of the difference between the stated fixed rate and current variable rate, and mature April 30, 2025. A natural hedging relationship exists in which changes in the fair value of the instruments act as an economic offset to changes in the fair value of the underlying items. Neither interest rate swap qualifies for hedge accounting since the Company did not contemporaneously document the hedging relationship, and as a result the changes in the fair value of the swap arrangements are reflected in current period earnings in ""interest expense, net"" within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of interest rate contracts is determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets. Interest rate contracts are valued using models based primarily on readily observable market parameters, such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") forward rates, for all substantial terms of the Company's contracts and credit risk of the counterparties. The fair value of the interest rate swap arrangements as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) is $7.2 million and included in ""other assets"" within the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognized $7.2 million in unrealized gains, net from the change in the fair value of the swap arrangements in ""interest expense, net"" within the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor).",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

These ASUs replace the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (""CECL"") methodology. The guidance primarily affects financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income but excludes operating lease receivables. The guidance primarily applies to our trade receivables and any future financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash that we may acquire in the future. ----- The Company adopted Topic 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under Topic 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable U.S. GAAP. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company, and no adjustment was required to member's equity (deficit) as of January 1, 2023 for the cumulative effect of adopting Topic 326. #### Note 2 — Significant Transaction On August 1, 2022 (""Transaction Date""), the Company's controlling interest was sold to Purchaser, and through Carnelian, a merger was effected resulting in a change of control event due to a new majority interest holder. The change of control event was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations, and accounted by Carnelian and pushed down to the Company by allocating the total purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value. Goodwill is expected to be partially deductible for U.S. tax purposes. The aggregate purchase consideration was $1,113.6 million. To finance a portion of the purchase price, a $410.0 million term loan debt instrument was used. Purchaser, through Carnelian, arranged the debt instrument on behalf of the Company, with Intermediate as ultimate borrower. In addition, the Company used part of the proceeds to extinguish its and Intermediate's existing debt. Refer to Note 9 for further information. Results of the Significant Transaction also included extinguishing existing debt and other obligations, extinguishment and settlement of vested Class A Units, the cancellation of unvested B Units and the distribution of vested B Units. The Company also settled $14.9 million of Predecessor Period related contingent consideration obligations as a result of the Significant Transaction on August 1, 2022.

The facilities provide vehicle repair collision services. The results of operations were included in the condensed consolidated financial statements since the respective acquisition dates. Acquisitions are financed with cash on hand funded by debt financing, and at times, equity units, convertible notes, seller financed notes and contingent consideration. The future earnouts were estimated as meeting or exceeding a forecasted gross sales target threshold over a certain post-acquisition period and expected to be earned and paid within a twenty-four-month or thirty-six-month period post-acquisition date. At each respective acquisition date, the Company evaluated the probability of future payments by comparing the forecasted gross sales to the contractual earnout requirements and determined the amount and likelihood of payment based on information available at this point in time. The one-time payments are fixed and not linear and range from $0.3 million to $2.0 million. At each subsequent reporting period end until either payment occurs or the future earnout period expires, the Company reassesses the probability of future payments and measures at fair value accordingly. The acquisitions were accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations. Tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values. The goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration and represents the excess of consideration transferred resulting from the acquisition less the fair value of all acquired identified assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is expected to be partially deducted for U.S. tax purposes. The Company completed 9 business combinations and acquired 15 vehicle collision repair facilities on various dates during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), including certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities for an aggregate purchase price of $50.6 million, subject to customary post-closing working capital adjustments, of which $19.8 million in aggregate purchase price related to one business combination that was a multi-shop acquisition in January 2023 that had 4 vehicle repair facilities. Total identifiable assets associated with the January 2023 multi-shop business combination were $7.5 million, which included $1.2 million attributable to property, plant and equipment and $6.3 million attributable to customer relationships. The acquisitions were financed with cash funded by debt financing, rollover equity and seller notes. The following table represents the allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor): Total purchase consideration $ 50,550 Allocation of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed: Inventories 30 Property, plant and equipment 2,752 Intangible assets 16,176 Total identifiable assets, net 18,958 Goodwill 31,592 Total net assets acquired $ 50,550 Total cash consideration was approximately $45.4 million and non-cash consideration was approximately $5.2 million, consisting of rollover equity and seller notes. In addition, the Company recognized $0.5 million in transaction costs in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023 (Successor). ----- The Company completed 11 business combinations and acquired 42 vehicle collision repair facilities on various dates during the period from August 1, 2022 through September 30, 2022 (Successor), including certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities for an aggregate purchase price of $255.1 million, subject to customary postclosing working capital adjustments, of which $200.5 million in aggregate purchase price related to three business combinations that were multi-shop acquisitions that had 29 vehicle repair facilities. Total identifiable assets associated with these three multi-shop business combinations were $101.9 million, which included $10.5 million attributable to property, plant and equipment and $78.2 million attributable to customer relationships. The acquisitions were financed with cash funded by debt financing under the Successor Credit Agreement, convertible notes issued by Carnelian, and contingent consideration. The following table represents the allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the period from August 1, 2022 through September 30, 2022 (Successor): Total purchase consideration $ 255,081 Allocation of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed: Cash 3,623 Accounts receivable 1,454 Inventories 1,228 Other current assets 672 Property, plant and equipment 13,318 Right-of-use assets - operating 6,114 Customer relationships 95,643 Other assets 94 Accounts payable (1,604) Accrued expenses (1,718) Customer deposits (202) Operating lease liabilities (5,158) Deferred tax liability (11,773) Total identifiable assets, net 101,691 Goodwill 153,390 Total net assets acquired $ 255,081 Total cash consideration was approximately $229.0 million and non-cash consideration was approximately $26.1 million, consisting of $1.1 million in contingent consideration and $25.0 million in Carnelian issued convertible notes. In addition, the Company recognized $1.9 million in transaction costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the period from August 1, 2022 through September 30, 2022 (Successor).

Reserves for IBNR claims are based on the Company’s claims history, actuarial determined loss development factors and qualitative considerations, such as claims management activities. Total claims reserves were $6.4 million as of September 30, 2023 (Successor), recognized in ""accrued expenses"" within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,389

Although the Company is not able to predict the outcome of such actions, after reviewing all pending and threatened actions with counsel and based on information currently available, management believes that the outcome of such actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial position. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Company’s results of operations in a particular future period as the time and amount of any resolution of such actions and its relationship to the future results of operations are not currently known. The Company accrues losses when they are probable of occurrence and such losses are reasonably estimable.

The Company completed 3 business combinations consisting of 8 vehicle collision repair facilities for an aggregate purchase price of $20.9 million between October and December 2023. The business combinations were funded with a combination of cash on hand and financing from the Revolving Credit Facility, that has borrowings outstanding of $26.0 million as of January 12, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the accounting for these business combinations. The Company concluded that no other events have occurred that would require recognition or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements. ----- ## New SK HoldCo Sub, LLC and Subsidiaries For the 171 days ended December 31, 2022 (Successor), the 193 days ended July 13, 2022 (Predecessor), and the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022 (Predecessor) and January 2, 2021 (Predecessor) ----- ##### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT To the Board of Directors and Members of  Carnelian Point Holdings, L.P. Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of New SK HoldCo Sub, LLC and subsidiaries (the “Company”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 (Successor Company balance sheet) and January 1, 2022 (Predecessor Company balance sheet), and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, member’s equity (deficit), and cash flows for the 171 days ended December 31, 2022 (Successor Company operations) and the 193 days ended July 13, 2022, and the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 (Predecessor Company operations), and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 (successor) and January 1, 2022 (predecessor), and the results of its operations and its cash flows from July 14, 2022 to December 31, 2022 (successor), January 2, 2022 to July 13, 2022 (predecessor), and for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022 (predecessor), and January 2, 2021 (predecessor), in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Emphasis of Matter As discussed in Note 1 and Note 2 to the Financial Statements, on July 14, 2022, based upon agreed‐upon terms an out of court financial restructuring was consummated by Carnelian Point Holdings, L.P., the Company’s ultimate parent. This resulted in a change of control. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with FASB Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations, for the Successor Company as a new entity with assets, liabilities, and a capital structure having carrying values not comparable with prior periods to the financial statements. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. ----- ##### Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:  Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.  Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control‐related matters that we identified during the audit. ----- ##### Other Information Included in the Annual Report Management is responsible for the other information included in the annual report. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audits of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.

These ASUs replace the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (""CECL"") methodology. The guidance primarily affects financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income but excludes operating lease receivables. The guidance primarily applies to our trade receivables and any future financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash that we may acquire in the future. The Company adopted Topic 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under Topic 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable U.S. GAAP.

The Restructuring Transaction resulted in a change in ownership and control and was recorded under the acquisition method of accounting by Carnelian and pushed down to the Company by allocating the total purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Carnelian resulted in goodwill, which was recognized by the Company through push-down accounting, and primarily relates to the value of the existing workforce, unidentifiable intangible assets and the fair value of expected synergies. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for U.S. tax purposes. The outstanding Predecessor debt was settled in exchange for equity interests in the Company through the issuance of convertible securities held at Carnelian. As part of the Restructuring Transaction, the Company's Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (""Amended Senior Facilities"") was restated. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. In addition, the Company's restricted cash of $30.0 million was released for general corporate purposes. Immediately subsequent to the change of control event, Carnelian contributed $125.0 million in cash to the Company and with the proceeds the Company immediately paid down the remaining $66.3 million of the senior secured revolving credit facility and other transaction costs. ----- The Company recognized $33.8 million in total transaction costs, comprised of $14.4 million and $19.4 million for the period July 14, 2022 through September 30, 2022 (Successor) and for the period January 2, 2022 through July 13, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively, as ""transaction expense"" within the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

As of January 1, 2022 (Predecessor), the remaining deferred loan costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $8.0 million, of which $0.9 million was reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in other assets and $7.1 million is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of long-term debt. #### Note 11 — Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at the inception date. The Company enters into leases primarily for collision repair facilities, administrative offices and equipment under varying terms and conditions. Leases have remaining lease terms of less than one year to twenty years. Some leases contain renewal options that may be exercised to extend the leases for up to twenty-five years. If extensions are reasonably certain at commencement, the term of the extension is included in the original lease term at commencement. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized as short-term lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term within the consolidated statements of operations. Certain lease agreements include variable lease payments, generally based on consumer price indices or a percentage of sales. Variable lease payments that are assigned to an index are determined based on the initial index at commencement, and the variability based on changes in the index are included in variable lease cost. Leases with index based variable components are not remeasured for changes in indices unless other lease terms are amended. Variable lease payments based on a percentage of sales are not included in the initial measurement of the ROU asset or lease liability due to the uncertainty of the payment amount and are recorded as variable lease expense in the period incurred. The lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Many of lease agreements contain non-lease components such as maintenance, property taxes and other similar costs, which are generally accounted for separately and allocated on a relative stand-alone price basis. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the contractual obligation to remit lease payments. Operating and finance ROU assets and the corresponding liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease, otherwise the Company uses a collateralized incremental borrowing rate (""IBR""), calculated based on the weighted average of estimated current borrowing rate for secured financing, using a risk free U.S. Treasury rate spread between five and twenty years. The IBR is based on lease tenor of five to thirty years, and is updated quarterly. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ROU assets-operating and the associated current and long term liabilities are separately identified in the consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets-finance are included in property, plant and equipment and the associated finance lease current and long-term liabilities are identified separately in the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended January 2, 2021 (Predecessor), the Company withheld portions of and/or delayed payments to certain landlords as the Company sought to renegotiate payment terms, in order to further maintain liquidity due to the economic impact of COVID-19. In some instances, certain lease contracts were negotiated resulting in abated rent, rent deferrals and lease term adjustments. The Company recognized abated rent as a reduction in lease expense during the concession period, and continued to recognize lease expense on a straightline basis for rent deferrals, and recognized adjustments in the payment period. As of December 31, 2022 (Successor) and January 1, 2022 (Predecessor), deferred payments resulting from rent concessions were less than $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and were included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended January 1, 2022 (Predecessor), the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell and lease-back twenty-one vehicle repair facilities. The initial term is fifteen years with up to four, five-year extension options, and classified as an operating lease. The Company received net proceeds of $64.4 million and ----- recorded approximately $49.2 million of ROU assets and lease liabilities, and recognized a $29.0 million gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment within the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 (Successor), twenty-three leases were modified and reassessed in accordance with Topic 842. One lease was reclassified from operating to finance leases for a total of $2.4 million and one lease was reclassified from finance to operating leases for a total of $2.7 million. During the year ended January 1, 2022 (Predecessor), twenty-seven leases were modified and reassessed in accordance with Topic 842. Two leases were reclassified from operating to finance leases for a total of $2.5 million and four leases were reclassified from finance to operating leases for a total of $ 9.1 million. During the year ended January 2, 2021 (Predecessor), the Company modified the existing lease on its corporate headquarters due to terminating two of the three occupied suites. The lease modification resulted in a reduction of ROU assets of $7.0 million, a reduction of lease liabilities of $10.2 million and a net gain of $0.3 million for lease termination recorded as a loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, recognized within the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended January 1, 2022 (Predecessor), the remaining suite was terminated and the Company recognized a gain on lease termination of $1.3 million within the (gain) loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment within the consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended January 1, 2022 (Predecessor) and January 2, 2021 (Predecessor), the Company recognized $0.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to impairment of ROU assets due to permanent store closures within (gain) loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment within the consolidated statements of operations.  During the periods July 14, 2022 through December 31, 2022 (Successor) and January 2, 2022 through July 13, 2022 (Predecessor), the Company did not incur or recognize impairment charges to ROU assets.

The Company may recognize transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period for all of its financial instruments. Any changes to market liquidity conditions, the availability of observable inputs or changes in the economic structure of a security marketplace may require a transfer of the instruments between levels. There were no transfers between levels during the years ended January 1, 2022 (Predecessor) and January 2, 2021 (Predecessor). The fair value of interest rate caps are measured with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the Company’s own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparties' nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements where appropriate. Although the Company has determined that the majority of inputs used to value the interest rate caps fall within Level 2, as the derivative instruments are traded over the counter and valued using internal models based on observable market inputs, the credit valuation adjustment utilizes Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. However, as of January 2, 2021 (Predecessor), the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the interest rate caps. As a result, the Company classified the derivative instruments in Level 2 in their entirety. For further information about the Company’s derivative instruments, see Note 13. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments. The carrying value of operating and finance lease obligations approximates fair value as the related interest rate approximates rates currently available to the Company. The Company’s valuation of long-term debt, excluding the Senior Notes, is based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar terms and remaining maturities. Since the Company does not believe there has been a change in its credit quality from the date of issuance, and the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facilities have variable interest rates, the carrying amount approximates fair value. |Col1|Predecessor| |---|---| ||January 1, 2022| |Level 1|| ----- #### Note 15 — Income Taxes The Company's operations are all domestic.

Formal relationships with insurance companies, such as Service King Direct Repair Programs (""DRPs""), play an important role in generating sales for the Company. Typically vehicle owners have the freedom to choose the repair provider, and can be influenced by the insurance companies.

The Company leases vehicle collision repair facilities, administrative offices and equipment under operating leases, and leases vehicles and equipment under finance leases. Leases have remaining lease terms of less than one year to twenty years. Some leases contain renewal options that may be exercised to extend the leases for up to twenty-five years. If extensions are reasonably certain at commencement, the term of the extension is included in the original lease term at commencement. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are recognized as short-term lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Certain lease agreements include variable lease payments, generally based on consumer price indices or a percentage of sales. Variable lease payments that are assigned to an index are determined based on the initial index at commencement, and the variability based on changes in the index are included in variable lease cost. Leases with index-based variable components are not remeasured for changes in indices unless other lease terms are amended. Variable lease payments based on a percentage of sales are not included in the initial measurement of the right-of-use (""ROU"") asset or lease liability due to the uncertainty of the payment amount and are recorded as variable lease expense in the period incurred. The lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Many of the lease agreements contain non-lease components such as maintenance, property taxes and other similar costs, which are generally accounted for separately and allocated on a relative stand-alone price basis. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the contractual obligation to remit lease payments. Operating and finance ROU assets and the corresponding liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease, otherwise the Company uses a collateralized incremental borrowing rate (""IBR""), calculated based on the weighted average of estimated current borrowing rate for secured financing, using a risk-free U.S. Treasury rate spread between five and twenty years. The IBR is based on lease tenor of five to thirty years and is updated quarterly. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ROU assets - operating and the associated current and long-term liabilities are separately identified in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets - finance are included in property, plant and equipment and the associated current and long-term liabilities are identified separately in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. On May 19, 2023, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell and lease back thirteen shop locations to an unrelated party.

The incentives included a $28.0 million advance payment for paint materials purchase rebates (prebate) received by the Company upon execution of the RA. The deferred paint incentive represents the long-term portion of the prebate received upon execution of the RA and will be amortized to ""cost of sales"" over the life of the contract. #### Note 11 — Employee Benefit and Incentive Plans The Company offers a qualified 401(k) profit-sharing plan (the ""Plan""). The Plan allows for elective wage deferrals by all employees meeting minimum age and length of service requirements with the Company.

LTIP participants may be entitled to a one-time cash payment upon the resolution of a future contingent event.
