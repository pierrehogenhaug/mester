(the “Company”) is offering $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “Senior Secured Notes”). The Senior Secured Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per year, payable semiannually in arrears on and of each year, beginning on, 2024. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on, 2029. The Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes at any time on or after, 2026 at the redemption prices specified under “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.” In addition, prior to, 2026 we may redeem (i) up to 40% of the Senior Secured Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and (ii) during each twelve-month period, up to 10% of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may also redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes prior to, 2026 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date plus a “make-whole” premium. In addition, if certain kinds of “changes of control” occur, we must offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the purchase. The Senior Secured Notes will be the senior secured obligations of the Company, will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness, will rank senior in right of payment to its existing and future subordinated indebtedness, will rank effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the Company and indebtedness that is secured by junior-priority liens on the Collateral (as defined herein), in each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, and will rank effectively junior to all of the Company’s other indebtedness that is secured by liens on other assets of the Company that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of those other assets. The Senior Secured Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by the Company’s parent company, Amwins Holding Company, LLC (“Amwins Holding”), and certain subsidiaries of the Company (the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with Amwins Holding, the “Guarantors”). The guarantees will be general secured obligations of each Guarantor and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, will rank senior in right of payment to their existing and future subordinated indebtedness, will rank effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the Guarantors and indebtedness that is secured by junior-priority liens on the Collateral, in each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, and will rank effectively junior to all of the Guarantors’ other indebtedness that is secured by liens on other assets of the Guarantors that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of those other assets. The Senior Secured Notes and guarantees will be secured equally and ratably with the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities by first-priority liens on substantially all of our and our Guarantors’ existing and future assets. The Senior Secured Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes— Security for Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Guarantees.” Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to any registration rights.

These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this offering circular and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth and strategies and the industry in which we operate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We believe these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this offering circular. Those factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements in this offering circular. Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this offering circular. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering circular, those results or developments may not be indicative of our results or developments in subsequent periods. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations are: - the loss of the services of our key brokers, underwriters and executive officers; - negative changes in premium pricing or the commissions we receive for placing insurance products; - a decline in revenues from supplemental commissions, which by their nature are difficult to forecast or predict; - difficulty collecting our receivables; - reductions in insurer capacity; - adverse changes in global economic conditions; - our inability to successfully acquire businesses, or unanticipated liabilities or poor performance associated with acquired businesses; - our inability to successfully integrate business acquisitions; - difficulty in maintaining our corporate culture as we grow; - the termination or change in the terms of one or more key programs for which we act as a managing general agent or underwriter; - our inability to place profitable business for the insurance carriers that have given us authority to place insurance on their behalf, or if our underwriting models contain errors or are otherwise ineffective, or our underwriters do not demonstrate sufficient skill; - damage to our reputation; v ----- - the interruption or loss of our information processing systems; - risk associated with having geographically dispersed offices and significant international operations; - our inability to grow organically through opening new offices, hiring new brokers and underwriters or engaging in business development initiatives; - our inability to use, maintain and develop technology to support our business; - the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personal information; - our inability to take actions that are not supported by our Investors; - a change in the way insurance products are distributed; - competition in our industry; - the loss of customers through consolidation; - competition from retail insurance firms who develop or acquire their own wholesale insurance operations or otherwise obtain direct access to the insurance products we distribute; - the failure of third-party service providers to adequately perform services for us; - an increase in the cost of our employee benefits plans and programs; - loss of access to cash, investment and fiduciary accounts we have with depository institutions in excess of governmental-insured balances; - a failure of our internal controls; - changes to the judgments, estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of our financial statements; - impairments to our goodwill or intangible assets; - negative changes in U.S. capital markets that affect our ability to borrow; - infringement, misappropriation or dilution of our intellectual property or failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; - litigation matters, including errors and omissions claims; - our compliance with U.S. and foreign governmental regulation and supervision; - changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry; - our substantial leverage, as well as restrictions imposed by the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities, the indenture that governs our 4.875% Senior Notes and the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes that will limit our ability to finance future operations, acquisitions or capital requirements or engage in other business activities; - our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and meet our other ongoing liquidity needs; - our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries to pay interest and principal on the Senior Secured Notes; and - those discussed herein under the caption “Risk Factors.” Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make in this offering circular vi ----- speak only as of the date of those statements, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update those statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"We refer to the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenue and organic revenue growth (each, as defined in “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data”) in various places in this offering circular. These are supplemental financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of “non-GAAP financial measures,” such as those mentioned above and ratios related thereto. These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial measures are publicly presented and require, among other things: - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and - a statement disclosing the purposes for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measure. The rules prohibit, among other things: - the exclusion of charges or liabilities that require, or will require, cash settlement or would have required cash settlement, absent an ability to settle in another manner, from a non-GAAP liquidity measure; and - the adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it has occurred in the past two years or is reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering circular may not comply with the SEC rules governing the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. For example, some of the adjustments to EBITDA made in connection with calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA presented in this offering circular would not be allowed under SEC rules. Furthermore, certain of the adjustments and pro forma effects are based on estimates and assumptions, including with respect to the future performance of our supported offices. While we believe we have a reasonable basis for these estimates and assumptions, they are subject to change. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material. We have also presented certain financial information for the last twelve months period ending September 30, 2023, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe this presentation provides investors with useful information to assess our recent performance in the same manner as our management team. Please see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a vii ----- further discussion and quantification of non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering circular, including the reasons we believe this information is useful to management and to investors and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Under these programs, insurance carriers have authorized us to bind coverage on their behalf as a managing general agent or underwriter (MGU) for a designated type of risk, business or industry. Our authority to bind insurance is usually subject to underwriting guidelines, policy limits and pricing parameters that are typically developed jointly by these carriers and us on a collaborative basis and are specific to each program. When we serve as an MGU, we generally receive requests for insurance directly from retail insurance brokers, evaluate the risk based on the information submitted, and decide whether we will offer a quote for insurance coverage. If our client decides to bind coverage, we issue policies on behalf of the insurance carriers we represent. Our Underwriting division operates on behalf of insurance carriers and does not take insurance risk for the policies we bind. We typically bill and collect premiums on behalf of the insurance carrier. For some of our programs, we also administer claims. We believe these capabilities further strengthen our relationships with carriers and retail brokers through a deeper and more connected role in the insurance economic value chain. In many cases, our insurance carrier partners rely on our product knowledge and access to targeted risk classes. Certain products we offer within this division are proprietary in nature, including a property catastrophe product that is only distributed through our Brokerage division. We have a team of actuaries to support our MGU programs. Our actuarial staff provides actuarial and catastrophe modeling services to our insurance carrier partners to help monitor the overall 2 ----- profitability of these programs. Our actuaries also monitor the performance of our programs and work with our underwriters and insurance carriers to develop rate tracking mechanisms, pricing models and other underwriting tools. Our ability to analyze loss experience for our MGU programs enables us to be more proactive in adjusting pricing to ensure we are delivering adequate underwriting returns to our carrier partners. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our Underwriting division represented approximately 15% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

We serve as a general agent (GA) by providing core and specialty benefit products to our customers, who include retail benefit brokers and benefit consultants. We also serve as the exclusive employee benefits program manager in 14 jurisdictions for the largest professional employer organization (PEO) in the United States. In that role, we underwrite, manage and administer health and other employee benefit plans for employer groups that join the PEO. In addition, we distribute a group Medicare supplemental medical plan as well as a Medicare-approved prescription drug plan under Part D of the Social Security Act, primarily to employer groups that historically have offered retiree health benefits to their retired employees and are looking for alternative solutions. Our Group Benefits division provides products and services for over 57,000 employer groups that encompass over seven million employee lives. Revenue from this division is generated by an array of brokerage services (distribution of group health and benefit products), third-party administration services (for carriers, self-funded employer health plan sponsors and insureds), and underwriting (MGU for niche health and other benefit insurance programs). We also place and administer a wide array of group benefit products for member organizations. These products are acquired by national, regional and local member groups that frequently do not have the capability or desire to administer these plans and that seek ways to make membership in their organizations more appealing. Through our relationships with insurance carriers, we are able to help design customized group benefit plans to address the varying needs of these organizations. We are able to handle virtually all aspects of administering the types of group benefit products we place, including plan enrollment, eligibility, billing, collection and claims administration. We have made a substantial investment in several call centers that we use to provide assistance and support for the plans we administer. We provide administrative services to both insurance carriers and employers for plans we distribute as well as plans distributed by others.

951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.7,Our Industry,"We operate our business within the wholesale insurance distribution market, but place products associated with the broader P&C and employee benefits insurance markets. Property and Casualty Insurance Market._ P&C insurance brokerage is dependent on the economic performance of the broader P&C insurance market as brokers receive a commission based on a percentage of the dollar amount of the premiums placed. The volume of premiums placed is a function of both insurance rates or premium pricing and the underlying amount of coverage purchased. The amount of coverage purchased is affected by the broader macro-economic conditions within each market, and there tends to be a high correlation in the United States between GDP growth and the amount of premiums. Premium pricing is cyclical in nature and varies between “hard” markets in which premium rates are increasing, as compared to “soft” markets in which rates are declining. Insurance brokers typically are fee-based businesses that do not assume significant insurance liability risk. Insurance carriers sell commercial P&C and professional insurance products in the U.S. through “admitted” insurance carriers, which are carriers that are licensed in the state in which the risk is located, and “nonadmitted” insurance carriers that sell their products in the E&S lines market. Within the insurance market, there are standard insurance products and specialty insurance products. For standard insurance products, insurance rates, forms and coverages are relatively uniform, and insurance carriers tend to compete for customers primarily on the basis of reputation, financial strength, price, claims service and commissions. Specialty insurance products are sold to insured parties with more specialized or complex risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance products. Although price tends to be a key basis of competition among specialty insurance carriers, the coverage terms also are an important competitive factor. Group Benefits Insurance Market._ Group benefit insurance products are sold by life and health insurance carriers, which transact business with both wholesale and retail insurance brokers and, in some cases, directly with the sponsoring organization. Wholesale distributors of group benefit products generally place specialized group benefit products for unusual, unique or specific types of coverage. Some wholesale distributors also provide administrative services, such as premium, claims and other administrative services, to both insurance carriers and sponsoring organizations to support these products. Wholesale Insurance Brokerage Market._ Wholesale insurance brokers act as intermediaries between insurance carriers and retail insurance brokers by assisting retail brokers place business that is outside of their core expertise or ability to place directly. Wholesale insurance brokers often provide retail insurance brokers with specialty and E&S insurance products offered by admitted and non-admitted insurance carriers. It is not uncommon for retail insurance brokerage firms to use several wholesale insurance brokerage firms to assist in the placement of insurance. Similarly, insurance carriers typically distribute their products through multiple wholesale insurance brokerage firms. When a wholesale broker is used, the wholesale broker will pay a part of its commissions to the retail insurance broker. In some cases, wholesale insurance brokers act as an MGU for an insurance carrier. 4 ----- An MGU generally has authority to bind coverage on behalf of an insurance carrier for a specific type of risk, subject to agreed-upon guidelines and limits. An MGU does not, as such, take underwriting risks for the products that it distributes. The wholesale distribution channel allows insurance carriers to distribute their products more efficiently. Insurance carriers use wholesale insurance brokers because of their product expertise and distribution capabilities, allowing them to reduce or avoid the infrastructure and personnel costs associated with maintaining relationships with a large number of retail insurance brokerage firms. Wholesale insurance brokers typically are compensated by commissions paid by the insurance carrier, although they can also receive fees in addition to commissions for placing certain insurance policies. Commissions generally are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium for the underlying insurance policy. Many factors affect commission rates, including the type of insurance, competition among insurance carriers for that type of insurance, the particular insurance carrier involved, market cycles and the nature of the services provided by the wholesale insurance broker. When retail insurance brokers use wholesale insurance brokers to place coverage, they will agree how to split commissions paid by the insurance carrier. Historically, insurance carriers have frequently paid a greater commission rate on products distributed through wholesale insurance brokers because of the expertise provided by wholesale insurance brokers and because insurance carriers have lower infrastructure and other distribution costs for products distributed through the wholesale distribution channel. In addition, insurance carriers will sometimes pay wholesale insurance brokers contingent commissions that depend on the volume or profitability of the business they place for the carrier. The wholesale insurance brokerage industry has been affected by several macro and micro changes that have impacted the industry in recent years. Because of consolidation, the industry has become bifurcated between a few national firms and a large number of smaller regional and local firms. The national firms are better positioned to work with the largest and most sophisticated carriers due to a wider breadth of retail broker relationships as well as their technological sophistication. The larger the wholesale brokerage firm, the more integral they are to the distribution model of the insurance carriers operating in this segment of the insurance industry. Some specialty insurance carriers have shifted their focus away from doing business with a large number of retail brokers to selling their products through targeted distribution to select wholesale insurance brokers who understand their products and underwriting appetite, which reduces the complexity of their business and shifts costs from fixed to variable. The retail insurance brokerage industry has seen a large amount of consolidation over several years as the industry shifts from a high degree of fragmentation to one where several national platforms have emerged. This trend can have a positive or negative impact on the wholesale brokerage firms that do business with these retail brokerage firms, depending on their prior relationship with the consolidating firms and the post-consolidation strategy of the combined firms. Notwithstanding the substantial consolidation of retail brokerage firms, there are still more than 40,000 retail brokerage firms operating in the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.8,Our Competition,"The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive. A number of firms actively compete with us for clients and access to insurance carriers. Our Brokerage and International divisions compete with a number of other wholesale insurance brokerage firms, some of which are operated by large retail insurance brokerage firms, banks or financial service companies, as well as retail insurance brokerage firms and insurance companies. Some of our competitors are owned by customers. We primarily compete for business on the basis of relationships, reputation, client service, expertise in a given specialty line, and program and product offerings. Our ability to tailor our products 5 ----- and risk management services to meet the needs of retail insurance brokers can be a key differentiator. Our Underwriting and Access divisions compete with a variety of sources for standard and specialized insurance products that provide coverage similar to the types of products we distribute. In many cases, our competitors are other insurance carriers that offer similar products. In addition, we frequently compete with small- to mid-sized wholesale brokerage firms that provide products that are similar to the products offered by our MGU and binding authority programs. Although there are no large national wholesale insurance brokerage firms that regularly compete with our Group Benefits division, we compete with a variety of other businesses, including retail insurance brokers that distribute products similar to the types of products we distribute, insurance carriers that distribute these products directly through retail insurance brokers or to insured parties, benefit consultants who are able to assist in the distribution of these products and a number of other companies that provide group benefit administrative services. Our Group Benefits division competes for clients on the basis of product design and pricing, product knowledge and the ability to provide ancillary administrative services, as well as the cost of these services.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.9,Our Strengths,"_Leading market position, with extensive customer and carrier relationships. Our size and scale_ provide us with a unique position in the wholesale market to better assist our retail insurance brokerage clients and increase our relevance and position with our insurance carrier partners. As we increase both our market share with retail brokers and the depth of our relationships with insurance carriers, we further enhance our value proposition by providing better access to both constituents. We partner with over 2,500 insurance carriers and markets and maintain more than 34,000 retail brokerage firm relationships. Our scale and sophistication has led to increasing market clout and enhanced specialty product knowledge, further enhancing our market leading position. Based on information published in September 2023 by Business Insurance, we believe we are the largest U.S. P&C wholesale insurance broker and the second largest U.S. wholesale insurance broker overall based on premiums placed. Diversified business platform._ Our business model is highly diversified by the type of insurance products offered, the number of carrier and retail broker relationships, and the geographic scope of our operations globally. We believe our level of diversification helps insulate our business from changes (both macro and micro) affecting the customers and markets we serve and allows us to generate a more stable revenue stream. We are not dependent on any retail insurance broker customer (for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, no retail broker customer accounted for more than 6% of our commissions and fees, and our top five retail broker customers accounted for less than 19% of our commissions and fees) or insurance carrier or market (for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, no individual carrier or market accounted for more than 6% of our premium volume, and our top five carriers represented approximately 18% of premium volume). _Proven business model supports sustained growth with robust, recurring cash flow_ generation._ Our size and scale give us an advantage in terms of our relationships with both our retail insurance broker clients and our carrier partners. As large retail brokers seek to reduce the number of wholesale brokers they use, our size and scale make us attractive given the breadth of our access to carriers and specialty insurance products. Similarly, our size, scale and relationships with retail brokerage firms make us a key component of the distribution model of insurance carriers that offer the products we place. Our scale and business flow also enhances our expertise and experience in specialty risks, allowing us to provide better service to our clients and help our insurance carriers develop new 6 ----- products. This business model has historically generated steady organic revenue growth (18.8% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, 16.0% in 2022 and 17.0% in 2021, in each case compared to the preceding comparable period), expanding Adjusted EBITDA margins (35.4% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, 34.3% in 2022 and 34.4% in 2021), and solid cash flow generation. Proven consolidator in fragmented industry._ We maintain a broad U.S. and international platform and have historically used, and expect to continue to use, a disciplined acquisition strategy to expand our market share, product capabilities, diversification and geographic footprint. We believe this strategy has enhanced our business and complements our focus on core organic growth and operational improvement. We are selective about the acquisition targets we pursue. We completed eight acquisitions since January 1, 2020. We believe our entrepreneurial culture, decentralized approach to managing our business and centralized support offered by our corporate staff make Amwins appealing to individuals who have decided to sell their business. Virtually all of the owners of the businesses we have acquired have remained actively engaged in the business post-acquisition, which has facilitated the integration of these businesses. Experienced management team._ Our Chairman, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and division presidents have substantial experience and longstanding relationships developed over an average of more than 20 years of experience in the insurance industry. Our management team draws on its relationships and experience in the industry to identify opportunities to expand our business and collaborate with insurance carriers to help develop products to respond to market trends. Through their extensive relationships in the insurance industry, our management team also contributes to the successful recruitment of key brokers and underwriters to join Amwins.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.10,Our Strategy,"Increase growth by expanding distribution._ We strive to prudently grow our business by expanding our distribution channels across all of our divisions. Over the last five years, we have hired over 200 new brokers and underwriters in the United States, excluding brokers hired in connection with acquisitions. We intend to continue to organically grow our revenue through the addition of new brokers and underwriters and enhanced penetration of our existing markets. We have generated organic revenue growth of 18.8% during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and 16.0%, 17.0% and 8.8% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have over 1,200 producers who specialize in specific product lines or industry classes. We also provide our producers with access to what we believe is an industry-leading producer training program. Access to new markets and products._ We are focused on expanding our access to new markets and products to better serve the needs of our clients. For example, because certain admitted insurance carriers will not do business directly with small retail insurance brokerage firms, but will do business with us, our Access division has acquired a platform to provide these brokerage firms with access to a greater variety of standard insurance products. We also are actively working to develop new MGU programs, which represent an attractive growth opportunity given the emergence of alternative insurance markets and the specialized nature of these programs. In our Group Benefits division, we continue to explore opportunities to work with our insurance carrier partners to develop new products that help employers manage the rising cost of health care. Focus on operational efficiency and profitability._ We continue to be focused on the efficiency of our platform and expansion of our underlying profit margins through increased scale and operating leverage. We use an integrated back-office corporate support team in Charlotte, North Carolina, to 7 ----- provide our client-facing operations with virtually all of the administrative resources they need, including human resource, legal, information technology (IT), analytical and actuarial services. As a result, in most instances our growth (either organically or through acquisitions) can be achieved with relatively limited incremental expense, which drives a high degree of operating leverage. In addition, we actively look for opportunities to further use technology to support our business, including using our AmLINK platform to expand our data and analytics capabilities. Pursue opportunistic acquisitions._ We plan to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in a disciplined manner that will complement our existing business or help us expand into new wholesale distribution channels or markets. We have substantial experience in selecting and integrating acquisition targets and are positioned to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that arise. We believe that our entrepreneurial and operating culture make us an attractive partner to acquisition targets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

After giving effect to the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby (and assuming we use a portion of the proceeds and cash on hand to pay restricted payments of $1.05 billion as described in “Use of Proceeds”), and using the mid-point of our estimated range of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, we estimate that our total net debt-to-Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2023 is 4.88x (or 4.98x after giving effect to the Acquisitions (as defined below)).

We have entered into agreements to acquire two businesses (the “Acquisitions”), one of which closed on January 31, 2024 and the other of which is expected to be completed by March 31, 2024. The closing purchase price for these Acquisitions is payable in cash in the aggregate amount of $166.8 million and units of Amwins Holding.

951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.1,The loss of the services of any of our highly qualified brokers and underwriters or our executive officers could harm our business and operating results.,"Our future performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly qualified brokers and underwriters, including brokers and underwriters who work in the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. Competition for productive brokers and underwriters is intense, and our inability to recruit or retain these individuals could harm our business and operating results. Although many of our senior brokers and underwriters own an equity interest in Amwins Holding and have entered into employment agreements with us, we cannot assure you that these persons will remain in our employment. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any of the brokers or underwriters who leave our firm will comply with the provisions of their employment agreements (or other agreements with us) that preclude them from competing with us or soliciting our customers and employees or that these provisions will be sufficient to fully protect us from the loss of any business. The law governing non-compete agreements varies from state to state, and some states have recently introduced or passed legislation limiting or even prohibiting the use of non-compete agreements. For example, in California a law enacted in September 2023 prohibits employers from entering into or attempting to enforce non-compete agreements. In addition, in January 2023 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would prohibit employers from using non-compete agreements. If enacted, the FTC’s proposed rule would prohibit employers like us from implementing non-compete agreements with our personnel. If this proposed rule were to become finalized or jurisdictions in which we operate separately adopt similar laws or regulations, or our non-compete or non-solicit agreements are otherwise deemed unenforceable, we would be unable to prevent former employees from competing with us, which could potentially leave us unable to replace a departing employee with an equally qualified individual who is acceptable to our customers and business partners. Our success also depends on our key executive officers and the skills and relationships they bring to our business, as well as on our ability to attract and retain additional executive officers and key management personnel. Most of our executive officers have a number of years of experience with our company and in the insurance industry generally. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, or our inability to attract and retain additional executive officers or key management personnel, could harm our business and operating results.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.2,We may be negatively affected by changes in the amount of premiums charged and commissions paid for the insurance products we place.,"Premium pricing within the commercial property and casualty insurance market in which we operate historically has been cyclical based on the underwriting capacity of the insurance carriers 21 ----- operating in this market and has been impacted by general economic conditions. In a period of decreasing insurance capacity, insurance carriers typically increase premium rates. This type of market frequently is referred to as a “hard” market. In a period of increasing insurance capacity, insurance carriers tend to reduce premium rates. This type of market frequently is referred to as a “soft” market. Because our commission rates usually are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium charged for the insurance products that we place, our revenues are affected by the pricing cycle of the market. The frequency and severity of natural disasters and other catastrophic events can affect the timing, duration and extent of industry cycles for many of the product lines we distribute. It is very difficult to predict the severity, timing or duration of these cycles. The cyclical nature of premium pricing in the commercial property and casualty insurance market may make our operating results volatile and unpredictable. Business conditions generally and within the insurance industry also may affect: - The commission rates paid by insurance carriers on products we distribute; - The portion of commissions we receive from insurance carriers that we pay to our retail insurance brokerage clients in connection with the placement of insurance policies. The amount of these commissions often is negotiated on a case-by-case basis and can be affected by a number of factors, including the amount of business that a retail insurance brokerage firm places with us, competition within the wholesale insurance brokerage market, whether the retail insurance broker is being compensated by its client on a fee basis and the difficulty of obtaining insurance to cover a particular risk; - The fees we charge for certain insurance products we distribute, which are in addition to the commissions we receive and often are negotiated on a case-by-case basis; and - The fees we are able to charge for providing ancillary services such as premium and claims administration and actuarial services. Our Group Benefits division derives a substantial majority of its revenues from group health insurance plans. Premium rates for group health insurance plans are affected by several factors, including health care costs and general economic conditions such as changes in the level of employment and other factors that may affect employer spending for employee benefits. Federal and state sponsored health care programs (including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010) as well as proposals to alter the level of spending under these programs also can affect the market for group health insurance plans.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.3,"Supplemental commissions can vary and are difficult to forecast, and a reduction in the amount of supplemental commissions we receive may negatively affect our business and operating results.","Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by certain insurance carriers based on the profitability, premium growth, total premium volume or some combination of these factors for business we place with these carriers. Approximately 5.6% of our total revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to contingent commissions. Supplemental commissions can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of our receipt of payments or information from carriers related to the supplemental commissions we earn. In many cases we have little or no control over the amount of supplemental commissions we receive or the process by which insurance carriers estimate loss reserves, which affects the amount of supplemental commissions we may receive. Thus, it is difficult for us to predict or forecast the amount of supplemental commissions we will receive. If we are unable to meet insurance carriers’ profitability or volume goals, or if insurance carriers increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control, actual payments we receive may be less than 22 ----- anticipated. Because supplemental commissions directly affect our revenue and profitability, any decrease in the amount paid to us could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

As of September 30, 2023, our premiums receivable were approximately $1.5 billion, or approximately 21.0% of our total assets, and portions of our receivables are concentrated in certain businesses and geographies. Macroeconomic or political conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients and insurance carrier trading partners, which could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

The cost and availability of insurance and reinsurance are dependent on the profitability of a particular class or type of insurance, which can be affected by many factors including the frequency and severity of storms, natural disasters, catastrophic events and other factors. Capacity could contract if one or more insurance carriers became insolvent or decided to limit or eliminate the issuance of certain types of insurance we place for our clients or the locations where certain types of insurance are offered. We have no control over these matters. To the extent insurance or reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive, we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our clients desire, and the coverage we are able to procure for our clients may be too expensive or more limited than is acceptable.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.6,"Global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.","Our business and operating results may be materially affected by global economic conditions. Recently, concerns about the global economic outlook have adversely affected economic markets and business conditions in general. Geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and economic sanctions related thereto and the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas, and rising interest rates have adversely affected many aspects of the global economy. Sustained or worsening of these and other global economic conditions, including as a result of pandemics or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. While it is difficult to predict the effects of a deterioration in global economic conditions on our business, any significant reduction or delay by businesses in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Price inflation has also resulted in market volatility and uncertainty for global commerce. We have encountered an increase in certain of our operating costs as a result of price inflation. Although we are currently unable to determine to what extent continued inflation may impact us, future price increases may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Moreover, the effects of inflation may have a material adverse impact on insurance carriers, which in turn may materially and negatively 23 ----- affect the results of our operations. In addition, increased interest rates stemming from efforts to combat inflation have caused our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness to increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, to decrease correspondingly. Moreover, should a significant insurance carrier fail, be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages we offer our clients, overall capacity in the industry could be negatively impacted, which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance. The failure or downgrading of an insurance carrier could also result in errors and omissions claims against us. All of these scenarios could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.7,"If we are unable to successfully acquire businesses, or if they do not perform as we expect, our competitiveness, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.","One of our growth strategies is to acquire businesses that complement, expand upon or diversify our current operations. We have acquired over 55 businesses since January 1, 2002 (including eight since January 1, 2020), and we anticipate that we will continue to look for opportunities to acquire additional businesses. For example, we have entered into agreements to acquire two businesses, one of which closed on January 31, 2024 and the other of which is expected to be completed by March 31, 2024. Competition for new acquisitions is intense, which has tended to increase the purchase price paid for acquisitions. We are unable to predict whether or when we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, consummate any acquisitions we pursue or prevail over our acquisition competitors, who may be larger than we are and may have greater resources than we do. If we need additional capital to complete acquisitions we desire to pursue, we may be unable to secure such capital on satisfactory terms. Our senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing our 4.875% Senior Notes and the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes limit the amount of additional debt we may incur. Our ability to secure future financing would depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets, our operating performance and then-existing debt levels and cash flows. If we are unable to continue to acquire other businesses, it is likely that our revenue and earnings growth will be negatively affected. Despite due diligence investigations we conduct before acquiring a business, we may not succeed in identifying all material risks and uncertainties associated with that business. Unanticipated contingencies or liabilities, such as litigation, the loss of significant clients or accounts, the termination or amendment of significant contracts and the loss of key brokers or employees, are inherent risks in acquisitions. Furthermore, businesses that we acquire may not achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability or productivity or otherwise operate in a manner consistent with our expectations or comparable to our existing businesses due to events beyond our control, such as changes in market conditions, increased competition and other factors. The failure of the businesses that we acquire to achieve our performance goals could have an adverse impact on our operating results and overall business. When we acquire an entity, a portion of the purchase price may be allocated to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. The amount of purchase price allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets we acquire. Accounting rules require that we conduct annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Deterioration in our operating results, including the loss of a significant client or clients at one of our acquired businesses, could result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which would cause us to record a non-cash charge for the impairment. Although such a charge would be a non-cash charge, it could nevertheless adversely affect our reported results of operations. 24 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

The integration of a business involves a number of factors that may affect our operations. These factors include: - retention of personnel; - diversion of management’s attention; - difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, systems and processes; - entry into new or unfamiliar markets; - unanticipated problems or liabilities; and - tax and accounting issues. To date, we believe we have been successful in integrating the businesses we have acquired without material disruption to our existing business or the acquired businesses. We nevertheless may encounter issues associated with integrating existing businesses or new acquisitions in the future. Our failure to integrate successfully businesses we have acquired may disrupt our operations and harm our overall business and operating results. We permit many of our acquired businesses to remain under the day-to-day oversight of previous owners or other individuals who played a key role in the development of the business. We cannot predict how long these individuals will continue to be actively engaged in our business. In many cases, the reputation and skills of these individuals and the relationships they have with employees and other business partners are critical to our success.

We believe our culture will be a key component of our future success and our ability to retain and recruit personnel, expand the products and services we offer, and execute on our business strategy. If we are unable to preserve our corporate culture, it could materially impair our ability to recruit, hire, train, manage and integrate new employees, retain existing employees, pursue opportunities to expand our business, and service and attract new clients, all of which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Our MGU and binding authority programs are governed by contracts between us and the applicable insurance carrier. These contracts establish, among other 25 ----- things, the underwriting and pricing guidelines for the program, the scope of our authority and our commission rates for policies that we underwrite under the program. These contracts typically can be terminated by the insurance carrier with little advance notice. Moreover, upon expiration of the contract term, insurance carriers may request changes to the terms of the program, including the amount of commissions we receive, which could reduce our revenues from the program. The termination of one or more of our key MGU or binding authority programs, or a change in the terms of these programs, could harm our business and operating results.

When we place insurance on behalf of our insurance carrier partners, we rely on the skills and expertise of our underwriters developed over years of experience with certain industries or types of insurance products, as well as the utilization of proprietary underwriting models and third-party tools. If our underwriters do not perform with the expected level of skill, or any of the models or tools that we use contain programming or other errors or otherwise are ineffective, or the data provided by clients or third parties is incorrect or stale, or if we are unable to obtain accurate data from clients or third parties, our pricing and approval process could be negatively affected, resulting in potential violations of underwriting authority and the loss of business and insurance programs.

Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which in turn could make it difficult for us to maintain existing clients and attract new ones.

Interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through loss of stored data, breakdown or malfunctioning of computer equipment and software systems, telecommunications failure, or damage 26 ----- caused by terrorist activities, cybersecurity attacks, fire, tornadoes, lightning, electrical power outage, natural or other disasters or other disruption could harm our business and operating results. Although we have disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against certain contingencies, we cannot assure you that our recovery procedures will be effective or that our insurance will continue to be available at reasonable prices, cover all such losses or compensate us for the loss of business occurring during any period in which we are unable to provide services. While we manage some of our information technology systems and some are outsourced to third parties, all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage, breakdown or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyberattacks, ransomware, malware, security breaches, theft or misuse, unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures or other compromise. The techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and compromise information technology infrastructure, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for some time. In addition, there has been an increase in state-sponsored cyberattacks, which are often conducted by capable, well-funded groups. The adoption of artificial intelligence technologies amplifies these concerns. Certain businesses we have acquired have been subject to ransomware and other cybersecurity breaches. We have taken measures to protect against any future attacks and disruptions on our information technology systems. Nevertheless, because the techniques used to infiltrate or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If we are unable to maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain aspects of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. While we select our third-party vendors carefully, cyberattacks and security breaches at a client or vendor could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business and could put our systems at risk. For example, in 2023, one of our vendors suffered a data breach that resulted in the unauthorized access of certain personal information of almost all of our U.S.-based employees. Although we do not currently believe that this incident presents a material risk to us, incidents like this may subject us to litigation or financial loss. Additionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk. We might not adequately identify weaknesses in our acquired businesses’ information systems, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us, our clients or third-party vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client, employee or company data. In addition, we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner. We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations and operating results, and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues.

In addition, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time, and they could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. We face transactional exposure between the U.S. dollar revenue and British Pound expense in our International division, where a significant part of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars while a substantial portion of our operating expenses is denominated in British Pounds. Therefore, a stronger U.S. dollar in relation to the British Pound would produce more profitable results in our consolidated financial statements, and a weaker U.S. dollar would have the opposite result. Additionally, we have exposure to other currencies, which creates additional exchange rate risk for us. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate these risks.

In the United States, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers, MGU’s and third-party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage, MGU and third-party administration services in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our ability to maintain all required licenses and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. In addition, most states require that our employees who engage in brokerage activities in that state be licensed personally. Failure to maintain the necessary licenses or to comply with the various insurance rules and regulations would have an adverse effect on our operating results, particularly if it affected any of our significant businesses. We also are required in many states to report, collect and remit surplus lines taxes to state taxing authorities for insurance policies placed in the E&S lines market. The laws and regulations regarding the calculation of surplus lines taxes vary significantly from state to state, and it can be difficult and time consuming to determine the amount of surplus lines taxes due to a particular state, especially for insurance policies covering risks located in more than one state. From time to time, we and our licensed employees are subject to inspection by state governmental authorities with regard to our compliance with state insurance laws and regulations and the collection of surplus lines taxes. We also are affected by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance carriers. For example, when we act as an MGU for an insurance carrier, we may be required to comply with laws 35 ----- and regulations affecting the insurance carrier. Moreover, governmental regulation of insurance carriers with which we do business can affect how we conduct operations. State laws grant supervisory agencies, including state insurance departments, broad regulatory authority. State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, some of which affect us. These supervisory agencies regulate, among other things, the licensing of insurance brokers and third-party administrators, the handling and investment of third-party funds held in a fiduciary capacity and the marketing practices of insurance brokers, in the context of curbing unfair trade practices. This continual reexamination may result in the enactment of laws and regulations, or the issuance of interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that adversely affect our business. More restrictive laws, rules or regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult and expensive or adversely affect our business. Violations of applicable federal or state laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or censures, disciplinary actions, including the revocation of licenses or registrations, damage to our reputation, or a limitation on our business. Moreover, the costs of complying with these regulations may increase our operating expenses. Changes in the regulatory scheme, or changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing our cost of complying with these regulations. Likewise, increased government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, new regulatory developments could increase competition and adversely affect us.

This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by: - increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; - limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, the prices we can charge for our services, or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, insurance carriers and third parties; or - subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions or proceedings. There have been efforts in recent years to regulate data privacy and the use and protection of personal information. In the United States, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which significantly enhances privacy requirements and the protection and use of personal information. Other states have enacted, introduced or considered similar legislation. 36 ----- In the United Kingdom and the European Union, new laws and regulations have imposed new data privacy compliance obligations and significant penalties for noncompliance. Other jurisdictions internationally have sought to adopt similar and in some cases more expansive data protection laws and regulations. It can often be difficult to evaluate the scope of these laws and regulations, their applicability to our business, and the measures necessary to comply and monitor compliance with these laws and regulations, which in some cases are inconsistent with similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations can result in significant additional compliance costs, divert management time from other projects and restrict the way we do business and use and store data, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations. Further, in the event that we are found to be out of compliance with any applicable state, federal and/or foreign laws and regulations, we could potentially be subject to civil or criminal sanctions, damage to our reputation, and other costs and impacts, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

We continue to evaluate how our business may be affected by legal and regulatory developments as well as the necessary steps for compliance with new laws and regulations as they are adopted. Moreover, the increasingly global nature of our business escalates the complexity of measures necessary to comply with laws and regulations, including the development of internal systems, policies and employee training programs that increase the cost of doing business. Internationally, many laws and regulations may have conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, further increasing the complexity, cost and risk of compliance.

These actions have created uncertainty concerning long-standing methods of compensating insurance brokers. Given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices, and the transparency and disclosure to clients regarding these compensation practices, it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future. If they do so, compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

As of September 30, 2023, after giving effect to the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, we would have had $4.9 billion of indebtedness outstanding, $4.1 billion of which would have been secured indebtedness. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, $298.0 million would have been available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility (after giving effect to undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face amount of $2.0 million). Our financial performance could be adversely affected by our substantial leverage. This high level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including, but not limited to: - we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to outstanding debt obligations; - we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other purposes; - we may need to use all, or a substantial portion, of our available excess cash flows to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities, including, but not limited to, working capital requirements, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other general corporate or business activities; - our debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions; - some of our debt has variable rates of interest and, to the extent such debt is not swapped at a fixed rate, we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates; - our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general; - our substantial amount of debt and the amount we must pay to service our debt obligations could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; - we may have increased borrowing costs; - our clients or insurance carriers may react adversely to our significant debt level; 38 ----- - we may have insufficient funds, and our debt level may also restrict us from raising the funds necessary, to retire certain of our debt instruments tendered to us upon the occurrence of a change of control, which would constitute an event of default under certain of our debt instruments; and - our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which, among other things, require us to maintain specified financial ratios and limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. Our high level of indebtedness requires that we use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital requirements, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other general corporate or business activities. In addition, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities. If market interest rates increase, debt service on our variable-rate debt will rise, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial position. Although we have employed hedging strategies such that a portion of the aggregate principal amount of our term loans carries a fixed rate of interest, any hedging arrangement put in place may not offer complete protection from this risk. Additionally, the remaining portion of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities that are not hedged will be subject to changes in interest rates.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing debt instruments or otherwise in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We may be unable to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such refinancing may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a general discussion of our cash flows and liquidity. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or acquisitions, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may be unsuccessful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The restrictive covenants included in the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes, the indenture that governs our 4.875% Senior Notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities restrict our ability to use the proceeds from certain asset sales. We may be unable to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and the proceeds that we do receive may be inadequate to meet any debt service obligations when due. 39 ----- If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default under our debt instruments, including the Senior Secured Notes, and holders of such debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Upon any such bankruptcy filing, we would be stayed from making any ongoing payments on the Senior Secured Notes, and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs or charges, or any “adequate protection” under Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). Furthermore, if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced under the Bankruptcy Code, we could be subject to claims, with respect to any payments made within 90 days prior to commencement of such a case, that we were insolvent at the time any such payments were made and that all or a portion of such payments, which could include repayments of amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes, might be deemed to constitute a preference, under the Bankruptcy Code, and that such payments should be voided by the bankruptcy court and recovered from the recipients for the benefit of the entire bankruptcy estate. Also, in the event that we were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case seeking reorganization or other relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a delay or substantial reduction in payments under the Senior Secured Notes may otherwise occur.

Generally, the ability of a subsidiary to make cash available to its parent is affected by its own operating results and is subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in security instruments, both equity and debt, and other agreements. Although certain of our debt instruments limit the extent to which our subsidiaries may enter into agreements that limit their ability to make dividend and other payments to us, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions. 41 ----- Moreover, there may be restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us under applicable laws, including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to their owners only from profits.

If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Based on our outstanding debt balances at September 30, 2023, an immediate hypothetical change of 10% in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately $8.6 million on an annual basis, net of the effect of our interest rate swap agreements. We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk and could be subject to credit risk themselves.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

The indenture governing our 4.875% Senior Notes contains similar provisions. Additionally, under our senior secured credit facilities, a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to 42 ----- accelerate the maturity of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and terminate their commitments to lend. Our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. The source of funds for any purchase of the Senior Secured Notes and the 4.875% Senior Notes and repayment of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by our existing or new owners. We may not be able to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. In particular, if the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities becomes due and is not paid, the lenders thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral that secures such indebtedness, thereby limiting our ability to raise cash to purchase the Senior Secured Notes and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. If we fail to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes in that circumstance, we will be in default under the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes.

Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a court could void the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes or a guarantee or claims related to the Senior Secured Notes or subordinate a guarantee to all of our other debts or to all other debts of a Guarantor if, among other things, we or a Guarantor, at the time we or such Guarantor incurred the indebtedness or issued a guarantee: - intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the delivery of the Senior Secured Notes or the guarantee, as the case may be, and if we or the Guarantor: - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - was engaged in a business or transaction for which our or the Guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (as all of the foregoing terms are defined or interpreted under the relevant fraudulent transfer or conveyance statutes). In addition, a court could void any payment by us or a Guarantor pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes or a guarantee and require that payment be returned to us or such Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our creditors or the creditors of the Guarantor. If the Senior Secured Notes or guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against us or the Guarantors for amounts payable on the Senior Secured Notes would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. Even if the guarantee of a Guarantor is not avoided as a fraudulent transfer, a court may subordinate the guarantee to that Guarantor’s other debt. In that event, the guarantees would be structurally subordinated to all of the Guarantor’s other debt. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made by us or the Guarantors. 43 ----- The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the governing law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of all of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. We cannot be certain what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or, regardless of the standard, that a court would not void the Senior Secured Notes or the guarantees thereof. The Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes will contain a “savings clause,” which is intended to limit the liability of each Guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such Guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. We cannot assure you that this limitation will protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the Senior Secured Notes in full when due. Furthermore, in the case _Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc. v. Citicorp North America, Inc., the U.S._ Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause used in the Indenture was unenforceable. As a result, the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the liability findings of the Bankruptcy Court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally. If the TOUSA decision is followed by other courts, the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased. We believe that, after giving effect to this offering, we will not be insolvent, will not have unreasonably small capital for our business and will not have incurred debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they mature. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid or intangible and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, in full or at all. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time (or at all) in an orderly manner. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties, including junior liens, encumber assets located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such encumbrances that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. In particular, the Indenture will permit certain liens, including liens on excluded assets and liens in favor of third parties to, among other things, secure purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and any assets subject to such liens may be automatically excluded from the Collateral where the agreement governing such indebtedness or obligation prohibits the grant of a lien on such assets to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Senior Secured Notes from the sale of the Collateral and any unpaid obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other indebtedness secured by pari passu (or 47 ----- senior) liens will rank equally in right of payment with any claim of all of our other senior unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness, including trade payables, against our and, as applicable, the Guarantors’ remaining assets. In addition, the Indenture will permit us to incur additional indebtedness secured by a lien on the Collateral that ranks on a pari passu basis with the liens securing the Senior Secured Notes. Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted by an increase in the additional indebtedness secured by pari _passu liens on the Collateral. Certain other creditors may have liens (including statutory liens), whether_ or not permitted by the Indenture, which rank prior to the liens of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Collateral. Any such liens may further limit the recovery from the realization of the value of the Collateral available to satisfy holders of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Related to the Collateral,13.4.3,The imposition of certain permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral and in certain cases will cause the asset on which such liens are imposed to be excluded from the Collateral. There are also certain other categories of property that are similarly excluded from the Collateral.,"The Collateral may be subject to liens permitted under the terms of the Indenture. The existence of any permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral that could be realized by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes as well as the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. In addition, the imposition of certain permitted liens may cause the relevant assets to become “Excluded Assets” (as defined in “Description of Senior Secured Notes”) which will not secure the Senior Secured Notes or the related guarantees. In addition, the Indenture will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and any assets subject to such liens may be automatically excluded from the Collateral where the contract or other agreement in which such lien is granted prohibits the grant of a lien on such assets to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent or such grant shall constitute or result in a breach or would give the other party thereto the right to terminate such contract or agreement. Our ability to incur purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations is subject to limitations, as described in “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Other categories of Excluded Assets under the Indenture include leased real property, certain contracts, letter of credit rights below a threshold and equity and assets of unrestricted subsidiaries. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Security—Collateral.” Excluded Assets will not be available as Collateral to secure our and the guarantors’ obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. As a result, with respect to the Excluded Assets, the Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees will effectively rank equally with any of our other unsubordinated indebtedness and, as applicable, the Guarantors which is not secured by the Excluded Assets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the Senior Secured Notes and guarantees thereof and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral and the guarantees thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

The ability of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose on the 48 ----- Collateral on your behalf may be subject to perfection, priority issues, state or foreign law requirements and practical problems associated with the realization of the security interest or lien in the Collateral of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent, including cure rights, foreclosing on the Collateral within the time periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making additional filings, statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. We cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure you that foreclosure on the Collateral will be sufficient to make all payments on the Senior Secured Notes. The holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Trustee also may be limited in their ability to enforce a breach of the lien covenant that will be set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes and is described under “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants— Liens.” Some decisions of state courts have placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens or leasehold estates, and a lender may need to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default. Although the foregoing court decisions may have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal laws, the scope of such preemption, if any, is uncertain. Accordingly, a court could prevent the trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes from declaring a default and accelerating the Senior Secured Notes by reason of a breach of such covenant, which could have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to enforce the covenant.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Related to the Collateral,13.4.6,Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not control certain decisions regarding Collateral.,"Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Agreement, the Indenture and the related security documents will generally allow us and our subsidiaries to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over and freely operate the Collateral and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral. This may impact the type and quality of the security interest granted in respect of the Collateral. For example, so long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, we may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent under the Indenture, Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or the related security documents, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). In addition, to the extent we sell any assets that constitute Collateral, the proceeds from such sale will be subject to a lien securing the Senior Secured Notes only to the extent such proceeds would otherwise constitute “Collateral” securing the Senior Secured Notes under the related security documents. To the extent the proceeds from any sale of Collateral do not constitute “Collateral” under the applicable security documents, the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes would be reduced. Moreover, the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to make decisions regarding Collateral is limited by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Related to the Collateral,13.4.7,"There are circumstances other than the repayment in full, discharge or defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes under which the Collateral could be automatically released without consent of the Trustee, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.","Under various circumstances, all or a portion of the Collateral may be released, including: - to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral (to a person that is not us or a Guarantor) in a transaction not prohibited under the Indenture; 49 ----- - the Collateral becoming an Excluded Asset; - with respect to Collateral held by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its guarantee; or - pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. The guarantee of any subsidiary Guarantor will be released in connection with a sale of such subsidiary Guarantor, or issuance of the equity interests of such subsidiary Guarantor, in a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture and it should be noted that the Indenture will not prohibit the sale, transfer or issuance of any equity interests of a subsidiary Guarantor or other restricted subsidiary to third parties or other persons. The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a subsidiary Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, all of the liens in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on any Collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the Indenture. Designation as an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have no claim to such assets. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Security—Collateral— Release of Collateral,” “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Additional Secured Note Guarantees,” “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Related to the Collateral,13.4.8,Bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize value from the Collateral.,"The right of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate arrangement, winding-up or similar law if bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate arrangement, winding-up or similar proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor or any other collateral, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A U.S. bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as due to the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Senior Secured Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or whether 50 ----- or to what extent holders of the Senior Secured Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” In addition, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that so long as any obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are outstanding, in the event of a bankruptcy, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to certain restrictions with respect to their ability to object to various motions or seek other relief with respect to the Collateral on a number of important matters, and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may under certain circumstances be required to turn over amounts they may receive in respect of the Collateral to the holders of obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as applicable. See “—The rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes may be adversely affected by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.” After such a bankruptcy filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may be unable to raise various objections or take other actions. As a general matter, under bankruptcy and insolvency law, our or any Guarantor’s liabilities in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees may, in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings, rank junior to certain other debt that is entitled to priority under the laws of such jurisdiction. Debt entitled to priority may include (1) amounts owed in respect of employee pension schemes, (2) certain other amounts owed to employees, (3) amounts owed to governmental agencies, including tax authorities and (4) expenses of an insolvency practitioner. In addition, in some jurisdictions, an examiner, monitor, trustee, receiver or administrator or similar party may be legally required to consider the interests of third parties (including, for example, employees) or the best interests of the relevant company in connection with the proceedings. Furthermore, in the event the U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference or “deficiency.” U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees for “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of undercollateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to the unsecured, deficiency portion of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made prior to or at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the U.S. bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Related to the Collateral,13.4.9,Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral.,"Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through the taking of certain actions. The liens on the Collateral from time to time owned by us securing obligations under the Senior Secured Notes may not be perfected if we have not taken the actions necessary to perfect any of those liens. Our inability or failure to promptly take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests in the Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection of the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property and intellectual property, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified and may then be subject to claw back in the event of bankruptcy of the relevant collateral provider. The Trustee or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent will not be required to monitor, and we may not inform the Trustee or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and necessary action may not be taken by us to properly 51 ----- perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or monitor the perfection of or make any filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Senior Secured Notes against third parties. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Senior Secured Notes against third parties. Even if the Trustee or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent does properly perfect liens on Collateral acquired or arising in the future, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or any guarantee issued in favor of the holders of Senior Secured Notes might be avoidable in bankruptcy or otherwise.” Additionally, the Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes will not require us to take a number of actions to perfect or to improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, including control agreements with respect to deposit accounts and securities accounts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Thus, in any bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or corporate arrangement or similar proceeding commenced within 90 days or any other applicable review period after lien perfection (or potentially one year for any “insiders”) or the issuance of a guarantee, a lien given to secure, or a guarantee given to guarantee, previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference, transfer at undervalue or otherwise by the applicable court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the completion date (or within any applicable 30-day statutory safe harbor). Accordingly, if we or any Guarantor were to file for bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or corporate arrangement or similar law after the Issue Date and a lien granted after such date had been perfected, or a guarantee issued, less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding (or any other applicable review period), such liens securing or guarantees guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes may be particularly subject to challenge and avoidance as a result of having been delivered after the Issue Date. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or a guarantee is avoided as a preference, transfer at undervalue or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee. 52 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the Senior Secured Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Senior Secured Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured “deficiency” claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would be limited to the value of the Collateral. The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under the Bankruptcy Code, as discussed above.

Our Brokerage division, also referred to in this discussion as “Wholesale Brokerage,” distributes property and casualty insurance products through our retail insurance brokerage clients. - Access. Our Access division distributes small commercial and personal insurance lines products nationally through our retail insurance brokerage clients primarily under binding authority contracts pursuant to which insurance carriers have authorized us to underwrite and distribute these policies on their behalf. - Specialty Underwriting. Our Specialty Underwriting division operates our MGU programs. As an MGU, we have contractual authority from various insurance carriers to underwrite, bind, issue and administer insurance policies on their behalf. This division also distributes its products through our retail insurance brokerage clients. - Group Benefits. Our Group Benefits division distributes group benefit insurance products through our retail insurance brokerage clients and provides related administrative services for insurance carriers that sell these insurance products, self-funded employer health plan sponsors and insureds. - International. Anchored by our Lloyd’s brokerage operation in London, our International division distributes specialty insurance and reinsurance products to clients worldwide through offices in strategic countries. Our international division operates under the “Amwins Global Risks” and “THB” brands.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

We evaluate acquisitions based on a variety of factors 57 ----- including product and service capability, producer talent, size, geographic and industry fit, operating performance and the quality of the existing management team. We have structured a number of our acquisitions to provide for contingent purchase price payments that depend upon the business reaching specified financial targets in the future (commonly referred to as “earn-outs”). We may use this structure for any acquisitions we pursue in the future. The purchase price for acquisitions may include varying combinations of equity of Amwins Holding (denominated as “units”), cash funded by our existing cash flow, borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and, for certain of these acquisitions, an obligation to pay earn-out payments in units, cash or both. From time to time, we also make equity investments in businesses that complement, support or are ancillary to our business. We apply the equity method of accounting to investments when we have significant influence, but not controlling interest, in the investee. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. We assess investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. Determining the fair value of investments in thinly traded public companies and privately held entities could require using a valuation model, which would include significant judgment and estimates. During 2022, we acquired two books of business (customer accounts) and Business Risk Partners, LLC, a managing general underwriter and program administrator for professional and management liability insurance products. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $49.1 million in cash and equity, including our estimated earn-out obligations. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we acquired two books of business (customer accounts) and an international insurance and reinsurance broker that specializes in insurance placements for the energy and marine industries, and increased our ownership of an investment in a managing general agent for admitted homeowners insurance accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.6,Certain Other Trends and Outlook,17.6.1,,"Insurance premium pricing within the P&C insurance industry has historically been cyclical based on the underwriting capacity of the insurance industry and economic conditions. External events, such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters, can also have a significant impact on the insurance market. We use the terms “soft market” and “hard market” to describe the business cycles experienced by the industry. A soft market is an insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates, which can negatively affect commissions earned by insurance brokers. A hard market is an insurance market characterized by a period of rising premium rates, which, absent other changes, can positively affect commissions earned by insurance brokers. Subsequent to the storms that occurred during the fall of 2017, property pricing turned positive in November 2017 after 47 straight months of declines. This positive pricing trend continued through the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the pandemic, including supply chain disruptions, have affected business activity across industries worldwide in virtually every location in which we operate. Although the global economy has improved from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a resurgence of the virus, as well as governmental and societal responses to the virus and the economic effects of these responses, could directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of COVID-19 on our business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.7,Revenues,17.7.1,,"Commissions and Fees._ Our commissions and fees consist of commissions paid by insurance carriers and fees charged for services we provide, net of the portion of the commissions and fees we pay to retail insurance brokers. The commissions we receive from insurance carriers are typically calculated as a percentage of the premiums paid for the insurance products we distribute. For property and casualty products, we typically earn our commissions on the latter of the effective date of the policy or the date coverage is bound. For group benefits products and services, we typically earn our commissions and administrative fees monthly based on eligible enrollment. Commission income and fees generated from outsourced administrative services are recognized ratably over the life of the underlying policy or contract period. We pay our retail insurance brokerage clients a portion of the gross commissions we receive from insurance carriers. Insurance carriers often pay a greater commission rate to wholesale insurance brokers than to retail insurance brokers. Thus, we frequently are able to pay our retail insurance broker customers a commission rate similar to what they would receive if they placed business directly. Because commission rates on the policies we place are generally calculated as a percentage of the premiums paid for a policy, they are affected by fluctuations in the amount of premium charged by insurance carriers. These premiums fluctuate based on, among other factors, the amount of capital available in the insurance marketplace, the type of risk being insured, the nature of the insured party and the terms of the insurance purchased. If premiums increase or decrease, our revenues typically move in a corresponding fashion. In a declining premium rate environment, the resulting decline in our 59 ----- revenue may be offset, in whole or in part, by an increase by insurance carriers of their commission rates and the fact that insured parties may use the savings generated by the reduction in premium rates to purchase greater coverage. In an increasing pricing environment, the resulting increase in our revenue may be offset, in whole or in part, by a decrease by insurance carriers of their commission rates and the fact that insured parties may determine to reduce the amount of coverage they purchase. Other Income._ Other income includes profit and other contingent commissions, interest income, licensing revenue and miscellaneous income, net of contingent commissions paid and payable to our retail clients. Profit and other contingent commission income is estimated and recognized to the extent future reversal is not probable. Contingent commission expense payable to our customers is generally recognized based on the timing of the revenue earned from placing business for these customers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

The proceeds from these facilities were used to refinance the amounts outstanding under our prior senior secured credit facilities initially put in place in January 2017 consisting of term loans of approximately $1,986.6 million original principal amount, and to pay related transaction expenses.

At that point, the earnings process has been completed, and we can reasonably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves based primarily on our historical cancellation experience, as adjusted for significant known circumstances as well as management’s judgment about known conditions. Commission income from the sale of group benefits insurance products or services is recognized as earned over the policy or contract period, which typically corresponds to the monthly billing cycle based on eligible enrollment. We record a reserve for policy cancellations, which is evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary based upon historical cancellation experience. Subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from insurance carriers. We utilize our historical actual cancellation experience to develop an estimated percentage of premiums cancelled. We believe this methodology is reasonable based on the fact that the data is from a large pool of homogenous transactions. This percentage is applied to each year’s actual revenue to derive the estimated portion of that year’s revenues that will be cancelled in a future period. Our historical policy cancellation experience has not fluctuated materially in the past. However, a change in our historical cancellation experience could cause us to adjust our estimated reserve in future periods. Cancellation trends could change based on significant changes in insurance capacity or pricing. In general, we expect policy cancellations to increase during a market experiencing significant price declines, and we expect cancellations to decrease during a market experiencing increasing prices. 78 ----- Profit commission income is estimated and accrued to the extent a significant reversal is not probable.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

These assets generally consist of purchased customer accounts, carrier relationships, non-compete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (goodwill). The determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets require significant judgment and affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges. All of our business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method. In connection with these acquisitions, we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased, which typically consist of purchased customer accounts, carrier relationships and non-compete agreements. Purchased customer relationships are amortized based on the expected undiscounted cash flows over the related estimated lives and contract periods, which range from 6 to 20 years. Trade names and noncompete agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (5 to 8 years for trade names and 3 to 5 years for noncompete agreements). Purchased carrier relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated life of 40 years. Purchased customer relationships obtained from acquired businesses are records and files that contain information regarding retail broker insurance customers and their accounts that are essential to maintaining that relationship. Purchased carrier relationships represent the estimated value of the program management services contract between us and a mutual insurance company. The management services contract is renewable annually on June 30. We expect the cash flows associated with the purchased carrier relationship to continue for a minimum of 40 years from the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized. In determining the purchase price for the acquisitions, we considered various factors including: (a) historical and projected revenue streams and operating cash flows of each company; (b) the management teams and sales personnel; (c) the potential to expand the market for our products/ services through their existing distribution channels; (d) the complementary nature of each company’s product/services offerings as an extension of the offerings of our existing business; and (e) the potential for new product/service offerings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

We classify goodwill and certain trade names as indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization. We review for goodwill impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether any impairment may exist. If we believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative two-step test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. For the quantitative test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is a potential impairment of goodwill. Based on the aggregation of our business components, our reporting units correspond to our divisions described above. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than 79 ----- its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using an income and market approach which includes consideration of multiples of revenues, EBITDA and estimated discounted future cash flows. We completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2022. There were no events or changes since the period following the annual impairment review through September 30, 2023 that caused us to perform an interim period impairment assessment. For nonamortizable trade names, we review for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether any impairment may exist. If we believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the nonamortizable trade name is less than its carrying value, a quantitative two-step test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. For the quantitative test, we compare the fair value of the nonamortizable trade name with its carrying value to determine if there is a potential impairment. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the nonamortizable trade name, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. We completed our annual nonamortizable trade names impairment analysis as of December 31, 2022.

If the vesting terms are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. We use the “modified prospective” method to account for equity-based compensation. We use the alternative transition method to determine the accounting of the income tax effects of payments made related to stockbased compensation. The fair value of common stock for options granted has historically been estimated by management using a market-based valuation methodology that estimates our enterprise value by using adjusted EBITDA multiplied by relevant market multiples. We did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist because we had a reliable measure of fair value as a result of acquisitions and market transactions, negotiated at arm’s-length prices with third parties throughout the period, which included equity consideration, to support the fair value of our common stock.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Valuation allowances may be recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.

We have assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge, and accordingly, changes in the fair market value of the interest rate swap are reflected in other income. Any differences between the fair value of the hedge and the item being hedged, referred to as the ineffective portion of the hedge, is immediately recognized in earnings as other operating expense. The fair market value of this instrument is determined by quotes obtained from the related counterparties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows.

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We periodically evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. If actual performance should differ from historical experience or if the underlying assumptions were to change, our financial condition and results of operations might be materially impacted. In addition, some accounting policies require significant judgment to apply complex principles of accounting to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, in determining the most appropriate accounting treatment. See Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a detailed description of our critical accounting policies. On January 1, 2020 we adopted new accounting guidance that requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. As a result, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period cash balances shown on the statement of cash flows. We were required to adopt this new guidance for all periods commencing on or after January 1, 2020, and the adoption of this new guidance changed the presentation in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as we now show the changes in the aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. Previously, the net change in restricted cash was reported as an operating activity, and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was not presented net of restricted cash.

We are exposed to market risk through our senior secured credit facilities and international operations. We use various techniques to manage our risk, including, from time to time, the use of derivative instruments. We have not entered, and do not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2023, there was $3,335.5 million of term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities, net of a $18.4 million original issue discount and $16.4 million of financing fees, and no borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility (which carries debt issuance costs of $1.6 million) other than undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face amount of $2.0 million. Term loans in the amount of $2,526.6 million bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.25%, and term loans in the amount of $843.6 million bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.75%. Interest on the revolving credit facility is the greater of 0.0% or Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.25%. As of September 30, 2023, these term loans bore interest at a weighted average rate of 7.82% per annum. Based on our outstanding debt balances at September 30, 2023, an immediate hypothetical change of 10% in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately $8.6 million on an annual basis, net of the effect of our interest rate swap agreements. We have entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against a portion of our variable rate term loans. The notional amount of the swaps is $1.7 billion. We are paying interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 1.34% on the swaps. We are receiving interest at the greater of the one-month Compounded SOFR plus a Term SOFR spread adjustment of 0.11% per annum and either 1.00%, with respect to $750 million notional amount of the swaps, or 0.75%, with respect to $900 million notional amount of the swaps. At September 30, 2023, the receiving weighted average interest rate is 5.43% on the swaps. The interest rate swap agreements have a weighted average remaining maturity of 2.2 years at September 30, 2023.

Under these programs, insurance carriers have authorized us to bind coverage on their behalf as an MGU for a designated type of risk, business or industry. Our authority to bind insurance is usually subject to underwriting guidelines, policy limits and pricing parameters that are typically developed jointly by these carriers and us on a collaborative basis and are specific to each program. When we serve as an MGU, we generally receive requests for insurance directly from retail insurance brokers, evaluate the risk based on the information submitted, and decide whether we will offer a quote for insurance coverage. If our client decides to bind coverage, we issue policies on behalf of the insurance carriers we represent. Our Underwriting division operates on behalf of insurance carriers and does not take insurance risk for the policies we bind. We typically bill and collect premiums on behalf of the insurance carrier. For some of our programs, we also administer claims. We believe these capabilities further strengthen our relationships with carriers and retail brokers through a deeper and more connected role in the insurance economic value chain. In many cases, our insurance carrier partners rely on our product knowledge and access to targeted risk classes. Certain products we offer within this division are proprietary in nature, including a property catastrophe product that is only distributed through our Brokerage division.

Our actuarial staff provides actuarial and catastrophe modeling services to our insurance carrier partners to help monitor the overall profitability of these programs. Our actuaries also monitor the performance of our programs and work with our underwriters and insurance carriers to develop rate tracking mechanisms, pricing models and other underwriting tools.

951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,212,BUSINESS,212.7,Our Industry,212.7.1,,"We operate our business within the wholesale insurance distribution market, but place products associated with the broader P&C and employee benefits insurance markets. Property and Casualty Insurance Market._ P&C insurance brokerage is dependent on the economic performance of the broader P&C insurance market as brokers receive a commission based on a percentage of the dollar amount of the premiums placed. The volume of premiums placed is a function of both insurance rates or premium pricing and the underlying amount of coverage purchased. 84 ----- The amount of coverage purchased is affected by the broader macro-economic conditions within each market, and there tends to be a high correlation in the United States between GDP growth and the amount of premiums. Premium pricing is cyclical in nature and varies between “hard” markets in which premium rates are increasing, as compared to “soft” markets in which rates are declining. Insurance brokers typically are fee-based businesses that do not assume significant insurance liability risk. Insurance carriers sell commercial P&C and professional insurance products in the U.S. through “admitted” insurance carriers, which are carriers that are licensed in the state in which the risk is located, and “nonadmitted” insurance carriers that sell their products in the E&S lines market. Within the insurance market, there are standard insurance products and specialty insurance products. For standard insurance products, insurance rates, forms and coverages are relatively uniform, and insurance carriers tend to compete for customers primarily on the basis of reputation, financial strength, price, claims service and commissions. Specialty insurance products are sold to insured parties with more specialized or complex risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance products. Although price tends to be a key basis of competition among specialty insurance carriers, the coverage terms also are an important competitive factor. Group Benefits Insurance Market._ Group benefit insurance products are sold by life and health insurance carriers, which transact business with both wholesale and retail insurance brokers and, in some cases, directly with the sponsoring organization. Wholesale distributors of group benefit products generally place specialized group benefit products for unusual, unique or specific types of coverage. Some wholesale distributors also provide administrative services, such as premium, claims and other administrative services, to both insurance carriers and sponsoring organizations to support these products. Wholesale Insurance Brokerage Market._ Wholesale insurance brokers act as intermediaries between insurance carriers and retail insurance brokers by assisting retail brokers place business that is outside of their core expertise or ability to place directly. Wholesale insurance brokers often provide retail insurance brokers with specialty and E&S insurance products offered by admitted and non-admitted insurance carriers. It is not uncommon for retail insurance brokerage firms to use several wholesale insurance brokerage firms to assist in the placement of insurance. Similarly, insurance carriers typically distribute their products through multiple wholesale insurance brokerage firms. When a wholesale broker is used, the wholesale broker will pay a part of its commissions to the retail insurance broker. In some cases, wholesale insurance brokers act as an MGU for an insurance carrier. An MGU generally has authority to bind coverage on behalf of an insurance carrier for a specific type of risk, subject to agreed-upon guidelines and limits. An MGU does not, as such, take underwriting risks for the products that it distributes. The wholesale distribution channel allows insurance carriers to distribute their products more efficiently. Insurance carriers use wholesale insurance brokers because of their product expertise and distribution capabilities, allowing them to reduce or avoid the infrastructure and personnel costs associated with maintaining relationships with a large number of retail insurance brokerage firms. Wholesale insurance brokers typically are compensated by commissions paid by the insurance carrier, although they can also receive fees in addition to commissions for placing certain insurance policies. Commissions generally are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium for the underlying insurance policy. Many factors affect commission rates, including the type of insurance, competition among insurance carriers for that type of insurance, the particular insurance carrier involved, market cycles and the nature of the services provided by the wholesale insurance broker. When retail insurance brokers use wholesale insurance brokers to place coverage, they will agree how to split commissions paid by the insurance carrier. Historically, insurance carriers have frequently paid a greater commission rate on products distributed through wholesale insurance brokers because of the expertise provided by wholesale insurance brokers and because insurance carriers have lower 85 ----- infrastructure and other distribution costs for products distributed through the wholesale distribution channel. In addition, insurance carriers will sometimes pay wholesale insurance brokers contingent commissions that depend on the volume or profitability of the business they place for the carrier. The wholesale insurance brokerage industry has been affected by several macro and micro changes that have impacted the industry in recent years. Because of consolidation, the industry has become bifurcated between a few national firms and a large number of smaller regional and local firms. The national firms are better positioned to work with the largest and most sophisticated carriers due to a wider breadth of retail broker relationships as well as their technological sophistication. The larger the wholesale brokerage firm, the more integral they are to the distribution model of the insurance carriers operating in this segment of the insurance industry. Some specialty insurance carriers have shifted their focus away from doing business with a large number of retail brokers to selling their products through targeted distribution to select wholesale insurance brokers who understand their products and underwriting appetite, which reduces the complexity of their business and shifts costs from fixed to variable. The retail insurance brokerage industry has seen a large amount of consolidation over several years as the industry shifts from a high degree of fragmentation to one where several national platforms have emerged. This trend can have a positive or negative impact on the wholesale brokerage firms that do business with these retail brokerage firms, depending on their prior relationship with the consolidating firms and the post-consolidation strategy of the combined firms. Notwithstanding the substantial consolidation of retail brokerage firms, there are still more than 40,000 retail brokerage firms operating in the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,212,BUSINESS,212.8,Our Competition,212.8.1,,"The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive. A number of firms actively compete with us for clients and access to insurance carriers. Our Brokerage and International divisions compete with a number of other wholesale insurance brokerage firms, some of which are operated by large retail insurance brokerage firms, banks or financial service companies, as well as retail insurance brokerage firms and insurance companies. Some of our competitors are owned by customers. We primarily compete for business on the basis of relationships, reputation, client service, expertise in a given specialty line, and program and product offerings. Our ability to tailor our products and risk management services to meet the needs of retail insurance brokers can be a key differentiator. Our Underwriting and Access divisions compete with a variety of sources for standard and specialized insurance products that provide coverage similar to the types of products we distribute. In many cases, our competitors are other insurance carriers that offer similar products. In addition, we frequently compete with small- to mid-sized wholesale brokerage firms that provide products that are similar to the products offered by our MGU and binding authority programs. Although there are no large national wholesale insurance brokerage firms that regularly compete with our Group Benefits division, we compete with a variety of other businesses, including retail insurance brokers that distribute products similar to the types of products we distribute, insurance carriers that distribute these products directly through retail insurance brokers or to insured parties, benefit consultants who are able to assist in the distribution of these products and a number of other companies that provide group benefit administrative services. Our Group Benefits division competes for clients on the basis of product design and pricing, product knowledge and the ability to provide ancillary administrative services, as well as the cost of these services. 86 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,212,BUSINESS,212.9,Our Strengths,212.9.1,,"Leading market position, with extensive customer and carrier relationships._ Our size and scale provide us with a unique position in the wholesale market to better assist our retail insurance brokerage clients and increase our relevance and position with our insurance carrier partners. As we increase both our market share with retail brokers and the depth of our relationships with insurance carriers, we further enhance our value proposition by providing better access to both constituents. We partner with over 2,500 insurance carriers and markets and maintain more than 34,000 retail brokerage firm relationships. Our scale and sophistication has led to increasing market clout and enhanced specialty product knowledge, further enhancing our market leading position. Based on information published in September 2023 by Business Insurance, we believe we are the largest U.S. P&C wholesale insurance broker and the second largest U.S. wholesale insurance broker overall based on premiums placed. Diversified business platform._ Our business model is highly diversified by the type of insurance products offered, the number of carrier and retail broker relationships, and the geographic scope of our operations globally. We believe our level of diversification helps insulate our business from changes (both macro and micro) affecting the customers and markets we serve and allows us to generate a more stable revenue stream. We are not dependent on any retail insurance broker customer (for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, no retail broker customer accounted for more than 6% of our commissions and fees, and our top five retail broker customers accounted for less than 19% of our commissions and fees) or insurance carrier or market (for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, no individual carrier or market accounted for more than 6% of our premium volume, and our top five carriers represented approximately 18% of premium volume). _Proven business model supports sustained growth with robust, recurring cash flow_ generation._ Our size and scale give us an advantage in terms of our relationships with both our retail insurance broker clients and our carrier partners. As large retail brokers seek to reduce the number of wholesale brokers they use, our size and scale make us attractive given the breadth of our access to carriers and specialty insurance products. Similarly, our size, scale and relationships with retail brokerage firms make us a key component of the distribution model of insurance carriers that offer the products we place. Our scale and business flow also enhances our expertise and experience in specialty risks, allowing us to provide better service to our clients and help our insurance carriers develop new products. This business model has historically generated steady organic revenue growth (18.8% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, 16.0% in 2022 and 17.0% in 2021, in each case compared to the preceding comparable period), expanding Adjusted EBITDA margins (35.4% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, 34.3% in 2022 and 34.4% in 2021), and solid cash flow generation. Proven consolidator in fragmented industry._ We maintain a broad U.S. and international platform and have historically used, and expect to continue to use, a disciplined acquisition strategy to expand our market share, product capabilities, diversification and geographic footprint. We believe this strategy has enhanced our business and complements our focus on core organic growth and operational improvement. We are selective about the acquisition targets we pursue. We completed eight acquisitions since January 1, 2020. We believe our entrepreneurial culture, decentralized approach to managing our business and centralized support offered by our corporate staff make Amwins appealing to individuals who have decided to sell their business. Virtually all of the owners of the businesses we have acquired have remained actively engaged in the business post-acquisition, which has facilitated the integration of these businesses. Experienced management team._ Our Chairman, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and division presidents have substantial experience and long 87 ----- standing relationships developed over an average of more than 20 years of experience in the insurance industry. Our management team draws on its relationships and experience in the industry to identify opportunities to expand our business and collaborate with insurance carriers to help develop products to respond to market trends. Through their extensive relationships in the insurance industry, our management team also contributes to the successful recruitment of key brokers and underwriters to join Amwins.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,212,BUSINESS,212.10,Our Strategy,212.10.1,,"Increase growth by expanding distribution._ We strive to prudently grow our business by expanding our distribution channels across all of our divisions. Over the last five years, we have hired over 200 new brokers and underwriters in the United States, excluding brokers hired in connection with acquisitions. We intend to continue to organically grow our revenue through the addition of new brokers and underwriters and enhanced penetration of our existing markets. We have generated organic revenue growth of 18.8% during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and 16.0%, 17.0% and 8.8% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have over 1,200 producers who specialize in specific product lines or industry classes. We also provide our producers with access to what we believe is an industry-leading producer training program. Access to new markets and products._ We are focused on expanding our access to new markets and products to better serve the needs of our clients. For example, because certain admitted insurance carriers will not do business directly with small retail insurance brokerage firms, but will do business with us, our Access division has acquired a platform to provide these brokerage firms with access to a greater variety of standard insurance products. We also are actively working to develop new MGU programs, which represent an attractive growth opportunity given the emergence of alternative insurance markets and the specialized nature of these programs. In our Group Benefits division, we continue to explore opportunities to work with our insurance carrier partners to develop new products that help employers manage the rising cost of health care. Focus on operational efficiency and profitability._ We continue to be focused on the efficiency of our platform and expansion of our underlying profit margins through increased scale and operating leverage. We use an integrated back-office corporate support team in Charlotte, North Carolina, to provide our client-facing operations with virtually all of the administrative resources they need, including human resource, legal, information technology (IT), analytical and actuarial services. As a result, in most instances our growth (either organically or through acquisitions) can be achieved with relatively limited incremental expense, which drives a high degree of operating leverage. In addition, we actively look for opportunities to further use technology to support our business, including using our AmLINK platform to expand our data and analytics capabilities. Pursue opportunistic acquisitions._ We plan to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in a disciplined manner that will complement our existing business or help us expand into new wholesale distribution channels or markets. We have substantial experience in selecting and integrating acquisition targets and are positioned to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that arise. We believe that our entrepreneurial and operating culture make us an attractive partner to acquisition targets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

In the United States, we are subject to state licensing requirements for insurance brokers and third-party administrators and regulations governing the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. In addition, most states require that our employees who engage in brokerage activities in that state be personally licensed by that state. We also are required in many states to report, collect and remit surplus lines taxes to state taxing authorities for insurance policies placed in the E&S lines market. We also are affected by the governmental regulation of insurance carriers. For example, when we act as a MGU for an insurance carrier, we may be required to comply with laws and regulations affecting the insurance carrier. Moreover, governmental regulation of insurance carriers with which we place business can affect how we conduct operations. With respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment.

As amended, our senior secured credit facilities consisted initially of term loans of $1,995.0 million original principal amount and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (substantially all of which was available at close for additional borrowings). The proceeds from these facilities were used to refinance the amounts outstanding under our prior senior secured credit facilities initially put in place in January 2017 consisting of term loans of approximately $1,986.6 million original principal amount, and to pay related transaction expenses. On July 19, 2021, concurrently with the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes, we incurred incremental term loans of $600.0 million in original principal amount. On February 15, 2023, we incurred additional incremental term loans of $850.0 million in original principal amount (the “2023 Incremental Term Loans”). As of September 30, 2023, there was $3,370.2 million in aggregate principal amount of term loans outstanding under these facilities and no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility other than undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face amount of $2.0 million. The revolving credit facility matures February 19, 2026, and the term loan facility matures February 19, 2028. We have the ability to request incremental term loan and revolving credit facilities from the existing lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or from additional lenders from time to time.

The applicable margin for borrowings of 2023 Incremental Term Loans is 2.75% with respect to term SOFR borrowings and 1.75% with respect to base rate borrowings.

The applicable margin for borrowings of revolving loans is 2.25% with respect to term SOFR borrowings and 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings. The undrawn amount of the revolving credit facility is subject to a commitment fee at an annual rate of 0.50%, and outstanding letters of credit are subject to a letter of credit participation fee at an annual rate equal to the applicable margin for term SOFR loans (adjusted quarterly) and a fronting fee at an annual rate of 0.25%. 98 ----- Prepayments._ The senior secured credit facilities require us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: - 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0% if our first lien net leverage ratio meets certain thresholds) of annual excess cash flow; - 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property by us or any of our restricted subsidiaries (including insurance and condemnation proceeds), subject to de minimis thresholds and to pro rata prepayment of any other indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the term loans that is required to be prepaid with such net cash proceeds, to the extent we do not reinvest these net cash proceeds in assets to be used in our business (1) within 365 days of the receipt of such net cash proceeds or (2) if we commit within 365 days of receipt to reinvest such net cash proceeds, within 18 months of the receipt thereof to the extent not reinvested; and - 100% of the net proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of indebtedness by us or any of our restricted subsidiaries, other than indebtedness permitted under the senior secured credit facilities.

951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.7,Guarantees,238.7.1,,"The Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by Holdings and each Domestic Subsidiary that guarantees the Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement or certain other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor as described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Secured Note Guarantees.” The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee, on a senior secured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company under the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents and the Senior Secured Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Senior Secured Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture or a supplemental indenture. Each Guarantee will be: - a general secured senior obligation of each Guarantor; - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor, including its guarantee of all Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the Existing Senior Notes; - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, including its guarantee of the Obligations under the Existing Senior Notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to the sharing of such value with the holders of senior, equal or prior ranking Liens on the Collateral); - secured on a senior priority basis (subject to Permitted Liens and certain other exceptions), equally and ratably with all existing and future Equal Priority Obligations of such Guarantor (including its Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement) by Liens on the Collateral; - effectively equal in priority with (but without regard to the control of remedies) all existing and future Equal Priority Obligations of such Guarantor (including its guarantee of all Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement) to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to the sharing of such value with holders of senior or prior ranking Liens on such Collateral); - effectively junior to all of the Company’s other indebtedness that is secured by liens on other assets of the Company that does not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of those other assets; - senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor; and 104 ----- - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities, including Preferred Stock, of any Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors. All of Holdings’ Subsidiaries (other than the Company) are also Subsidiaries of the Company. Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company or Guarantors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes—The Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any current and future non-guarantor subsidiaries.” The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such Indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and guarantees and require Secured Noteholders to return payments received, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Senior Secured Notes.” Each Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (a) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (b) the release or discharge of the guarantee or direct obligation by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the Senior Credit Agreement and, if applicable, the guarantee which resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release and that if any such guarantee or direct obligation is reinstated then such Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Secured Note Guarantees”); (c) the proper designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (d) the Company exercising the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Company’s obligations under the Indenture being satisfied and discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or (e) the merger, consolidation or amalgamation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, consolidation or amalgamation, or upon the liquidation of a Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets to the Company or another Guarantor. 105 ----- The Guarantee by Holdings shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (a) the Company exercising the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Company’s obligations under the Indenture being satisfied and discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or (b) the merger, consolidation or amalgamation of Holdings with and into the Company or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, consolidation or amalgamation, or upon the liquidation of Holdings following the transfer of all of its assets to the Company or another Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292
951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.8,Ranking,238.8.1,,"The Indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be senior secured obligations of the Company or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, and will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Company and such Guarantor, as the case may be, including the Obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Senior Credit Agreement, the Existing Senior Notes and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Obligations, the Indenture and the Guarantees are secured on a senior priority basis (subject to Permitted Liens and certain other exceptions) by Liens on the Collateral, equally and ratably with all existing and future Equal Priority Obligations of the Company and the applicable Guarantor, including Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement. Such Obligations are effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantors (including Obligations under the Existing Senior Notes), to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to the sharing of such value with holders of senior, equal or prior ranking Liens on the Collateral). The Senior Secured Notes Obligations, the Indenture and the Guarantees are effectively equal in priority with (but without regard to the control of remedies) all existing and future Equal Priority Obligations of the Company and the Guarantors (including the Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement) to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to the sharing of such value with holders of senior or prior ranking Liens on such Collateral). The phrase “in right of payment” refers to the contractual ranking of a particular Obligation, regardless of whether an Obligation is secured. As of September 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the sale of the Senior Secured Notes, Holdings and its Subsidiaries would have had $4.9 billion aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding, $4.1 billion of which would have been secured indebtedness. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, $298.0 million would have been available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility under the Senior Credit Agreement (after giving effect to undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face amount of $2.0 million). Substantially all of the operations of Holdings and the Company are conducted through the Company’s Subsidiaries. Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, including the Holders of Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company that are not Guarantors. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness by, and the issuance of Disqualified Stock and preferred stock of, certain of the Company’s Subsidiaries, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” All of Holdings’ Subsidiaries (other than the Company) are also Subsidiaries of the Company. Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. In the event of a 106 ----- bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and other liabilities, including their trade creditors and holders of their preferred stock, if any, before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company or Guarantors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes—The Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any current and future non-guarantor subsidiaries.” For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented 8.7% and 6.6% of the Pro Forma Adjusted Revenues and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, of the Company, on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, these non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented 12.0% and 8.7% of the assets and liabilities (excluding intercompany assets and liabilities), respectively, of the Company, on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries. Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture.

The value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on many factors. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes. The Collateral securing our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees is shared with other creditors. If there is a default, the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the creditors of Equal Priority Obligations, including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will be dependent on numerous factors, including the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, some of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value or market. In the event of a foreclosure, insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding or other similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the Company’s and the Guarantors’ Obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. Under U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Senior Secured Notes from the sale of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ other unsecured or undersecured senior Indebtedness and other unsubordinated Obligations, including trade payables. To the extent that third parties establish Liens on the Collateral, 111 ----- such third parties could have rights and remedies with respect to the assets subject to such Liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent or the holders to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. The Company may also issue Additional Senior Secured Notes after the Issue Date as described herein or otherwise incur Equal Priority Obligations that would be secured by the Collateral, the effect of which would be to increase the amount of Indebtedness secured equally and ratably by the Collateral. The ability of the holders to realize on the Collateral may also be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral—Bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize value from the Collateral.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

There will be no independent assurance prior to issuance of the Senior Secured Notes that all assets or properties contemplated to be pledged as security for the Senior Secured Notes will be pledged, or that we hold the personal property interests we represent we hold or that we may pledge such interests, or that there will be no lien encumbering such personal property interests other than those permitted by the Indenture. Delivery of security interests or perfection thereof in Collateral after the Issue Date increases the risk that the security interests could be avoidable in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. Additionally, the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents entered into in connection with the Senior Secured Notes will not require us to take a number of actions to perfect or to improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, including control agreements with respect to deposit accounts and securities accounts.

951,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.16,Certain Bankruptcy Limitations,238.16.1,,"In addition to the limitations described above, the right of the Collateral Agent to obtain possession, exercise control over or dispose of the Collateral following an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate arrangement, winding-up or similar laws if the Company or any Guarantor were to have become a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar law or statute under debtor relief, bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate arrangement, winding-up or similar laws in any applicable jurisdiction) prior to the Collateral Agent having obtained possession, exercised control over or disposed of the Collateral. For example, upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Collateral Agent, is prohibited by the automatic stay from obtaining possession of its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from exercising control over or disposing of collateral taken from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code and other debtor relief, insolvency, corporate arrangement or similar laws permit the debtor in certain circumstances to continue to retain and to use collateral owned as of the date of the bankruptcy or insolvency filing (and the proceeds, products, offspring, rents or profits of such collateral) even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, subject to certain protections that may be afforded to a secured creditor. In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Senior Secured Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or thereafter or whether or to what extent holders of the Senior Secured Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through adequate protection or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any Equal Priority Debt) is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the Indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Secured Notes would be “undersecured” and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would only hold secured claims to the extent of the value of the Collateral and would hold unsecured claims as to the difference. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. In addition, the Company or any Guarantor (or any trustee or similar official appointed therefor) or creditors of the Company or any Guarantor may seek to challenge the grant of the Collateral to the Collateral Agent as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, preference, transfer at undervalue or otherwise under the Bankruptcy Code and/or applicable state law. If such a challenge were successful, the Liens may be avoided, leaving the holders of the Senior Secured Notes with unsecured claims against the applicable entities.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in a Change of Control 124 ----- Offer and the Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described below, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date). The Senior Credit Agreement provides, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Company becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to Holdings and the Company would constitute a default thereunder (including but not limited to a Change of Control under the Indenture or the Existing Notes Indenture). If Holdings or the Company experiences a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement, Holdings or the Company could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement. In the event Holdings and the Company do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Agreement and/ or such other agreement, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement being declared due and payable. The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes—We may not be able to purchase the Senior Secured Notes upon a change of control, which would result in a default under the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes and would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.” The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of Holdings or the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and the Company. Subject to the limitations discussed below, Holdings or the Company could enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect its capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, including the Company, to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in 125 ----- advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Holdings. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Senior Secured Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to all or a portion of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (the “Advance Offer”). To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Senior Secured Notes and, if applicable, Equal Priority Obligations tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds Payment Amount (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for such amount offered in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Senior Secured Notes or the Equal Priority Obligations surrendered by such Holders and holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall select the Senior Secured Notes and such Equal Priority Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount or accreted value of the Senior Secured Notes or such Equal Priority Obligations tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Senior Secured Notes or Equal Priority Obligations, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero, but in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Proceeds the Company is offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Agreement) or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the Holder of any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds may apply any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture and such Retained Asset Sale Proceeds shall in no event and under no circumstances constitute Excess Proceeds.

Holdings will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments in an amount determined as set forth in the last 139 ----- sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch up payment” with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

The Indenture will provide that Holdings will not, and will not permit the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be. The Indenture will not treat (1) Indebtedness that is unsecured as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured and (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

The Company will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant if the Company or any Parent Entity of the Company has filed reports containing such information with the SEC. To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section “—Reports and Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default or Event of Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Company or any Parent Entity of the Company has made a good faith determination to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an initial public offering of such entity’s Capital Stock, the Company will not be required to disclose any information or take any actions that, in the good faith view of the Company, would violate applicable securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules. 158 ----- In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial statements, other information and documents required to be provided by this covenant shall be, rather than those of the Company, those of Holdings if Holdings and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries; such Subsidiaries at Holdings being referred to as “Holdings’ Subsidiaries”) conduct, transact or otherwise engage, or commit to conduct, transact or engage, in any business or operation, other than its direct and indirect ownership of all of the Capital Stock in, and its management of, the Company and operations incidental thereto); provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to Holdings, such information is accompanied by consolidating information, which may be unaudited, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information of the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the information relating to Holdings and Holdings’ Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand.

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes; (3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given (a) to the Company (with a copy to the Trustee) by the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes or (b) to the Company by the Trustee to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or the Notes Security Documents; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 120 days after receipt of such written notice; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary other than any Receivables Subsidiary or the payment of which is guaranteed by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary or pursuant to any Receivables Facility), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an 159 ----- obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, is in the aggregate equal to $100.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent); (5) failure by Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together as of the date of the most recent audited financial statements of Holdings would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $100.0 million (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; (7) the Guarantee of Holdings or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiary Guarantors that taken together as of the date of the most recent audited financial statements of Holdings would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason (except as contemplated by the express terms thereof or the Indenture) cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of such Guarantor (or the responsible officers of any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that taken together as of the date of the most recent audited financial statements of Holdings would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture; (8) the Liens created by the Notes Security Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless perfection is not required by the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents) other than (A) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Security Document and the Indenture, (B) the satisfaction in full of all Obligations under the Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results from the failure of the Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Notes Security Documents and (ii) such default continues for 30 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes; or (9) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Notes Security Document is invalid or unenforceable. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Company and Trustee, or the Trustee by written notice to the Company, may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately. 160 ----- Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Senior Secured Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it is actually known to a responsible officer of the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture will provide that the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Trustee and the Company may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Senior Secured Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder (including in connection with an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control Offer)) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose the Company delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and 161 ----- (5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. In addition, as described above under the caption “—Security,” the exercise of remedies with respect to the Collateral is subject to the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Holder’s Secured Note on or after the respective due date expressed in such Secured Note. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or Collateral Agent or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee and Collateral Agent. The Trustee and Collateral Agent, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents, as applicable, or that the Trustee or Collateral Agent determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder (it being understood that the Trustee and Collateral Agent does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such direction is unduly prejudicial to such Holders) or that would involve the Trustee or Collateral Agent in personal liability. The Indenture will provide that the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required, within 30 days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default, its status and the actions that the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. Any notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default or Event of Default, notice of acceleration or other notice to take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder of Senior Secured Notes delivered to the Company, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC, or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to such Holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default or Event of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification _Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC, or its nominee, any Position Representation or_ Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes in lieu of DTC, or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Collateral Agent, as applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be 162 ----- automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Senior Secured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity or security such Directing Holder may have offered the Trustee or the Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall have any liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Company) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to Participants or persons who hold interests through Participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are Participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are Participants in such system. 211 ----- So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the Global Notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture with respect to the notes. Any notices required to be given to the holders while the notes are Global Notes will be given to DTC. Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Company, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on the Global Notes, will credit Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by Participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such Participants. Transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of the Senior Secured Notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Indenture, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its Participants and which include a legend as set forth under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.” DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that Participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the posttrade settlement among Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect Participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly. 212 ----- Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among Participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of the Company, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its Participants or indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

Under the applicable Treasury regulations, certain contingencies do not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if such contingencies, as of the date of issuance, are remote or incidental. We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies are remote or incidental, and, accordingly, we do not intend to treat the Senior Secured Notes as contingent payment debt instruments. Our position that such contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our position is not, however, binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). If the IRS were to challenge this position successfully, a U.S. holder might have inclusions in income that differ materially in timing or amount or be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the Senior Secured Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate. In addition, holders may have to treat as ordinary interest income, rather than capital gain, any gain realized on the taxable disposition of Senior Secured Notes before the resolution of the contingency. The remainder of this discussion assumes the Senior Secured Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

This summary deals only with Senior Secured Notes that are held as capital assets by a U.S. holder or a non-U.S. holder (as each term is defined below) that acquires the Senior Secured Notes upon original issuance at their initial offering price. A “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation that is organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and under the control of one or more U.S. persons, or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. A “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes (other than an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not, for United States federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder. This summary is based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxes and does not deal with foreign, state, local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders or non-U.S. holders (collectively, “holders”) in light of their personal circumstances.

This summary also does not address U.S. federal estate and gift tax consequences.

The initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering circular. After the Senior Secured Notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms. The offering of the Senior Secured Notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Senior Secured Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each Initial Purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the Senior Secured Notes (A) to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. Sales of any Senior Secured Notes made outside of the United States may be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. In connection with sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the Senior Secured Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the Senior Secured Notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom it sells such Senior Secured Notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Senior Secured Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, with respect to Senior Secured Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the Senior Secured Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such Senior Secured Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Company has agreed in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that for a period of 120 days after the date of this offering circular, neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates over which it exercises management or voting control, nor any person acting on its behalf will, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the Senior Secured Notes. 223 ----- The Senior Secured Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Company has been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the Senior Secured Notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell Senior Secured Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of Senior Secured Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Senior Secured Notes while the offering is in progress. The Initial Purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular Initial Purchaser repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the discount received by it because Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC or its affiliates have repurchased Senior Secured Notes sold by or for the account of such Initial Purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions. These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Senior Secured Notes. As a result, the price of the Senior Secured Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. We expect that the delivery of the Senior Secured Notes will be made to investors on or about, 2024 which will be the U.S. business day following the date of this offering circular (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Senior Secured Notes prior to the second U.S. business day before the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Senior Secured Notes initially settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes who wish to trade the Senior Secured Notes prior to the second U.S. business day before the settlement date should consult their advisors. The Company and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we: - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General,"The operations of Amwins Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) consist primarily of wholesale distribution of specialty insurance products through retail agents and brokers in the United States of America and abroad. The operating companies conduct business in the capacity of wholesale insurance brokers, managing general underwriters and third-party administrators. The Company reports its results of operations through the following six segments: Amwins Brokerage, which distributes a broad range of property and casualty (“P&C”) insurance products nationally to retail insurance agents and brokers; Amwins Access, which distributes small business and personal lines P&C insurance products nationally, primarily through binding authority contracts where the insurance company has contracted with the Company to underwrite and distribute these policies on their behalf; Specialty Underwriting, which is comprised of numerous insurance programs for specific industry classes, trade groups and niche insurance products, and where the insurance company has contracted with the Company to provide the underwriting services for these programs on their behalf; Amwins Group Benefits, which distributes a range of specialty group benefit products to employer groups or associations nationally through retail insurance agents and brokers and also provides related administrative services to carriers; Amwins International, which distributes specialty insurance and reinsurance products to clients worldwide through offices in 12 countries in Europe, Latin America, Bermuda and Asia and operates a leading Lloyd’s brokerage operation in London; and Group Support which provides management and administrative services to support the Company.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

There are no operating activities at Holdco. For substantially all equity transactions of Holdco, including equity instruments issued as compensation and units issued as consideration for business combinations, Holdco and the Company enter into contemporaneous equity transactions in which the Company issues common shares or other equity interests to Holdco valued at the same value as Holdco’s equity transactions. The accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholder’s Equity reflect the equity transactions between Holdco and the Company that resulted from Holdco’s equity transactions with employees and third parties. In April 2015, Public Sector Pension Investment Board (“PSP”), a Canadian pension investment manager, acquired approximately 31% of Holdco’s equity (the “PSP Recapitalization”) primarily from New Mountain Capital, LLC (“NMC”) and the employee and other unit holders of Holdco. Since PSP only acquired approximately 31% of the equity of the Company, push-down accounting was not permitted at that time. Therefore, stockholder’s equity was not written up to fair value at the time of this recapitalization. In November 2016, a private equity fund managed by Dragoneer Investment Group, LLC (“Dragoneer”) acquired all of NMC’s remaining holdings in Holdco. Since Dragoneer only acquired approximately 35% of the equity of the Company, push-down accounting was not permitted at that time. Therefore, stockholder’s equity was not written up to fair value at the time of this transaction. F-9 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated through consolidation. In the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2022, the Company evaluated all material subsequent events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date on which the financial statements were available to be issued, which was April 6, 2023, for potential recognition in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and/or disclosure in the notes thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the currently enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances may be recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized.

This framework includes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation technique used to measure fair value. The classification of a financial instrument within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels of the hierarchy in order of priority of inputs to the valuation technique are defined as follows: Level 1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 1 assets and liabilities include equity securities traded in an active exchange market. Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Valuation is determined using model-based techniques with significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company’s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of third-party pricing services, option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques . The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, premium cash, premiums receivable, premiums payable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, due to the short maturity of these instruments.

The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 for public companies and December 15, 2021 for private entities. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective method; thus prior period information will not be restated. A lease is defined as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Leases are classified as finance leases if the lease transfers ownership, has a purchase option, is for a majority of the asset’s underlying life or the total present value of lease payments is substantially all the fair value of the asset. All other leases are classified as operating leases. The Company’s computer equipment leases are deemed finance leases. Lease liabilities are the present value of the remaining future fixed payments over the lease term using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the time of the lease commencement. Options to extend leases are not included in the lease term until the Company is reasonably certain those options will be exercised. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Right of use assets are the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less lease incentives received. Any variable lease payments are recognized when incurred. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients which permits us not to reassess our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classificatiion and initial direct costs. We also elected the practical expedients to not separate lease and non-lease components, to use hindsight when determining lease terms and to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases.

These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and were structured so that they were expected to be highly effective. The Company has entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against a portion of its variable rate term loans. The notional amount of the swaps is $1.8 billion.

The Company generated operating income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, is in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2022 and expects to remain in compliance with the covenants during 2023. Certain amounts reported in prior years in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. Commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from insurance carriers and recorded in the period in which the policy is endorsed or cancelled. Commission income and fees from the sale of benefits insurance products are recognized as earned over the policy period, which typically corresponds to the monthly billing cycle based on eligibility. The Company carries a reserve for policy cancellations which is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary based upon historical cancellation experience. The provision for cancellations and allowance for uncollectible premiums was $30.7 million and $29.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Commission revenue is reported net of commission expense incurred to the retail brokers and agents which is recognized on the same basis as the Company’s revenue. Other income includes contingent commissions, interest income and miscellaneous income, net of contingent commissions paid and payable to the Company’s retail producers. Contingent commissions are recognized to the extent future reversal is not probable. Variable consideration from carriers is estimated on a contract-by-contract basis. Those guaranteed as a set percentage of premium are accrued monthly over the contract period. Those based on volume of business or percentage of growth and those based on the underlying profitability of the business are estimated and recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal in revenue previously recognized will not occur. Contingent commission expense due to the Company’s retail producers is generally recognized based on the timing of the revenue earned from placing business for these retailers. Interest income is recorded as earned. The Company earns interest income on the premiums between the time they are collected from retail agents and brokers and the time they are remitted to the insurance carriers. This activity is part of the normal operations and accordingly is reported in revenues. Miscellaneous income includes underwriting income from rent-a-captive arrangements and other miscellaneous income. estimated using an income and market approach which includes consideration of multiples of revenues, earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and estimated discounted future cash flows. No goodwill impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. The Company performed a qualitative analysis as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, which did not indicate that it was more likely than not that the carrying values of the reporting units exceeded fair value. For non amortizable trade names, the Company reviews for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether any impairment may exist. If the Company believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the nonamortizable trade name is less than its carrying value, a quantitative two-step test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. For the quantitative test, the Company compares the fair value of the nonamortizable trade name with its carrying value to determine if there is a potential impairment. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the nonamortizable trade name, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. No nonamortizable trade name impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. The Company performed a qualitative analysis as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, which did not indicate that it was more likely than not that the carrying values of the nonamortizable trade name exceeded fair value. Other identifiable intangible assets include purchased customer relationships, carrier relationships, trade names and noncompete agreements. Purchased customer relationships are amortized based on the expected undiscounted cash flows over the related estimated lives and contract periods, which range from 6 to 20 years. Trade names and noncompete agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (5 to 8 years for trade names and 3 to 5 years for noncompete agreements). Purchased carrier relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated life of 40 years. Purchased customer relationships obtained from acquired businesses are records and files that contain information regarding retail insurance customers and their accounts that are essential to maintaining that relationship. Purchased carrier relationships represent the estimated value of the program management services contract between the Company and a mutual insurance company. The Company expects the cash flows associated with the purchased carrier relationship to continue for a minimum of 40 years. Intangible assets with finite lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that no conditions exist indicating they may be impaired. No impairments have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. method to account for equity-based compensation. The Company uses the alternative transition method to determine the accounting of the income tax effects of payments made related to stockbased compensation. The fair value of common stock for options granted was estimated by management using a market-based valuation methodology. A market approach was generally used to estimate the Company’s enterprise value by using adjusted EBITDA multiplied by relevant market multiples. The Company did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist because the Company had a reliable measure of fair value as a result of acquisitions and market transactions, negotiated at arm’s-length prices with third parties throughout the period, which included equity consideration, to support the fair value of its common stock. Upon the adoption of this new guidance, the Company recognized a lease liability of approximately $183 million and a corresponding right-of-use asset of approximately $156 million, including the reclassification of approximately $27 million of unamortized lease incentives.

In connection with the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes, the Company incurred incremental term loans under our senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the 4.875% Senior Notes to repay in full and redeem the Company’s 7.75% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”), consisting of $650.0 million principal amount (and $2.5 million of capitalized interest), and to pay a related redemption premium and all related transaction fees and expenses. The Company used the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the 4.875% Senior Notes, together with the net proceeds from our incremental term loans and cash on hand, to pay a dividend in September 2021 to Holdco (and Holdco’s owners), and to fund payments made or to be made to certain holders of stock options of the Company and unvested units of Holdco required in connection with such a dividend, in an aggregate amount of $749.9 million. In connection with the 2021 refinancing of our senior credit facilities, the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes and the repayment of the 2026 Senior Notes, the Company incurred $18.6 million of third-party expenses (included in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations) and a $42.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt consisting of a prepayment premium and expenses to write-off unamortized original issue discount and unamortized financing fees and expenses. As of December 31, 2022, there was $2,516 million of term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities, net of a $12.8 million original issue discount and $17.2 million of financing fees, $780.8 million of 4.875% Senior Notes outstanding after giving effect to $9.2 million of financing fees, and no borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility (which carries debt issuance costs of $2.1 million) other than undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face amount of $2.5 million. The senior secured term loans bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or LIBOR, plus a margin of 2.25%, and mature on February 19, 2028. As of December 31, 2022, these term loans bore interest at 6.63% per annum. The senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at the greater of 0.0% or LIBOR, plus a margin of 2.25%, and matures on February 19, 2026. The 4.875% Senior Notes are unsecured and accrue interest at an annual rate of 4.875%, payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning on December 31, 2021. The 4.875% Senior Notes will mature on June 30, 2029. The aggregate fair value of the Company’s debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The Company uses quoted market prices to estimate the fair value of its debt when available. When quoted market prices are not available, the estimated fair value of debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current credit market composite indices with similar terms and remaining maturities. F-22 ----- has a liability to the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the Company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. The following summarizes the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments: Income from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following: The significant items affecting our effective tax rate compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 21% include state income taxes, the impact of foreign operations and nondeductible expenses primarily related to equity-based compensation. The significant components of deferred income taxes included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows: As of December 31, 2022, the Company has U.S. federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards. The federal NOL is limited by Section 382. The federal and state NOL’s began expiring in 2022. Certain states now follow the federal provision, which permits an indefinite carryforward for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017. The Company’s open tax years that are subject to examination in the United States are 2019 through 2021 . The open tax years subject to examination with respect to various state jurisdictions are 2018 through 2021. In addition, the statute of limitations with respect to the state’s ability to adjust net operating losses generated before 2017 remain open to the extent of the losses generated for these periods. The Company is currently undergoing state income tax audits; we do not expect the results to be material. The Company has tax filing requirements in various foreign tax jurisdictions, and the statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction. The statute of limitation for the material foreign jurisdictions remains open from 2017 forward. As of December 31, 2022, no foreign jurisdictions are under audit. The following table presents the status and changes of the Company’s warrants: The following table presents the status and changes of service-based nonvested shares: In January 2020, the Company modified its outstanding stock option awards by reducing the exercise price of outstanding stock option awards by an amount equivalent to $20.99 per share for the special dividend paid in January 2020. For stock option awards which had exercise prices lower than the amount of the dividend paid, the stock option awards were reduced to $0.01 per share and an aggregate cash payment of $5.5 million was made for the remaining difference between the reduction in the exercise price and the dividend amount. The historical and prospective compensation expense for the modification of the stock option awards was not adjusted as the fair value of the stock options after the modification was not greater than the fair value of the stock option awards prior to the modification. In October 2020, the Company modified its outstanding stock option awards by reducing the exercise price of outstanding stock option awards by an amount equivalent to $23.48 per share for the special dividend paid in October 2020. For stock option awards which had exercise prices lower than the amount of the dividend paid, the stock option awards were reduced to $0.01 per share and an aggregate cash payment of $12.3 million was made for the remaining difference between the reduction in the exercise price and the dividend amount. The historical and prospective compensation expense for the modification of the stock option awards was not adjusted as the fair value of the stock options after the modification was not greater than the fair value of the stock option awards prior to the modification. In September 2021, the Company modified its outstanding stock option awards by reducing the exercise price of outstanding stock option awards by an amount equivalent to $28.34 per share for the special dividend paid in September 2021. For stock option awards which had exercise prices lower than the amount of the dividend paid, the stock option awards were reduced to $0.01 per share and an aggregate cash payment of $16.8 million was made for the remaining difference between the reduction in the exercise price and the dividend amount. The historical and prospective compensation expense for the modification of the stock option awards was not adjusted as the fair value of the stock options after the modification was not greater than the fair value of the stock option awards prior to the modification. The fair value of each stock option award was estimated at the date of grant using a BlackScholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: **2022** **2021** **2020** Dividend yield . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0% 0% 0% Risk free interest rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.87% 1.08% 1.79% Expected lives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.5 years 6.5 years 6.4 years Volatility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23.5% 22.4% 19.6% The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected lives are based on the simplified method described under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 (“SAB 110”). SAB 110 permits the use of the simplified method in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 for employee option grants after December 31, 2007, for companies whose historical data about their employees’ exercise behavior does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term of the options. The Company F-30 ----- continued to use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for options granted after December 2007, as adequate historical experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate. Volatility is based on an average of public companies with similar characteristics. Information with respect to outstanding options is as follows: The following table provides certain information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2022: The following table presents the expected stock and liability-based compensation expense in future periods for outstanding awards as of December 31, 2022: The following table presents amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet classified as either operating or finance leases. Operating leases are presented separately on our consolidated balance sheet. For the finance leases, the right-of-use (‘ROU’) assets are included in fixed assets, net, and the liabilities are classified within other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities.

Goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company classifies goodwill and certain trade names as indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization. The Company reviews for goodwill impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether any impairment may exist. If the Company believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative two-step test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. For the quantitative test, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is a potential impairment of goodwill. Based on the aggregation of its business components, the Company’s reporting units correspond to its reportable segments as defined above. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.

Income Taxes,"On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tax relief measures for businesses include a fiveyear net operating loss carryback, changes in the deductibility of interest, acceleration of alternative minimum tax credit refunds, payroll tax relief, and a technical correction to allow accelerated deductions for qualified improvement property. The Act also provides other non-tax benefits, including federal funding for a range of stabilization measures and emergency funding to assist those impacted by the pandemic. The Company took advantage of the technical correction to allow accelerated deductions for qualified improvement property. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenses and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for research activities performed in the United States and 15 years for research activities performed outside the United States pursuant to IRC Section 174. Although Congress is considering legislation that would repeal or defer this capitalization and amortization requirement, it is not certain that this provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or replaced, it will increase our U.S. federal and state cash taxes and reduce cash flows in fiscal year 2023 and future years. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low tax income (GILTI) in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. The Company has made a policy election to account for GILTl income tax as a current-period expense in the period when incurred. F-24 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

As a result, the Company has established a liability for certain tax benefits which the Company judges may not be sustained upon examination. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in other non-current liabilities and deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in income tax expense (benefit) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were not significant. Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were potential benefits of $16.0 million and $11 .3 million on December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate on income. The Company does not anticipate that existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. F-26 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,292

As amended, the senior secured credit facilities consisted initially of term loans of $1,995.0 million original principal amount and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (substantially all of which was available at close for additional borrowings). The proceeds from these facilities were used to refinance the amounts outstanding under the Company’s prior senior secured credit facilities initially put in place in January 2017 consisting of term loans of approximately $1,986.6 million original principal amount and an undrawn $125.0 million revolving credit facility, and to pay related transaction expenses. By amending the senior credit facilities, the Company was able to extend the maturity dates of these facilities, reduce its borrowing costs and expand certain of its operating covenants, among other things. On July 19, 2021, the Company completed the offering of $790.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) made in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes, the Company incurred incremental term loans under our senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2029 Senior Notes to repay in full and redeem the Company’s 7.75% senior notes due 2026 having an outstanding balance of $650.0 million principal amount (and $2.5 million of capitalized interest), and to pay a related redemption premium and all related transaction fees and expenses. The Company used the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the 2029 Senior Notes, together with the net proceeds from our incremental term loans and cash on hand, to pay a dividend in September 2021 to Holdco (and Holdco’s owners), and to fund payments made or to be made to certain holders of stock options of the Company and unvested units of Holdco required in connection with the dividend, in an aggregate amount of $749.9 million.

Depending on the acquisition date and the complexity of the underlying valuation work, certain amounts included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements may be provisional and thus subject to further adjustments within the permitted measurement period. The Company continues to evaluate certain assets and liabilities related to acquisitions completed during recent periods. Changes to amounts recorded as assets or liabilities may result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. the proceeds from these incremental term loans and cash on hand to pay a dividend in March 2023 to Holdco (and Holdco’s owners), and to fund payments made and to be made to certain holders of stock options of the Company and unvested units of Holdco required in connection with the dividend, in an aggregate amount of approximately $924.8 million. As of September 30, 2023, there was $3,335.5 million of term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities, net of a $18.4 million original issue discount and $16.4 million of financing fees, $781.9 million of 2029 Senior Notes outstanding after giving effect to $8.1 million of financing fees, and no borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility (which carries debt issuance costs of $1.6 million) other than undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face amount of $2.0 million. The term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities mature on February 19, 2028 and amortize in quarterly installments of approximately $8.6 million with the balance payable on the maturity date. Term loans in the amount of $2,526.6 million bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or one-month Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.25%, and terms loans in the amount of $843.6 million bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.75%. As of September 30, 2023, these term loans bore interest at a weighted average rate of 7.82% per annum. The revolving line of credit matures on February 19, 2026 and bears interest at the greater of 0.0% or one-month Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.25% _Interest Rate Swaps_ The Company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as a part of its overall strategy to manage interest rate risk on its debt. The Company’s use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk has been limited to interest rate swap agreements used to modify the interest characteristics for a portion of its outstanding variable rate debt. The Company has entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against a portion of its variable rate term loans. These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and were originally structured so that they were expected to be highly effective. As a result of the LIBOR reference rate transition, the Company engaged a third-party vendor to perform a statistical regression analysis on each interest rate swap. The results indicated that all hedge relationships would remain highly effective. As of September 30, 2023, all interest swaps continued to be highly effective. The notional amount of outstanding swaps is $1.7 billion. The Company is paying interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 1.34% on the swaps. The Company is receiving interest at the greater of the one-month SOFR-compound variable rate plus a spread adjustment of 0.11% per annum and either 1.00%, with respect to $750 million notional amount of the swaps, or 0.75%, with respect to $900 million notional amount of the swaps. At September 30, 2023, the receiving weighted average interest rate is 5.43% on the swaps. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, there was no ineffectiveness recorded in earnings related to the interest rate swap agreements. At September 30, 2023, the Company expects to reclassify $49.5 million of net gains, after tax, on derivative instruments from AOCI to earnings during the next 12 months as interest payments on the interest rate swaps occur. The interest rate swaps have a weighted average remaining maturity of 2.2 years at September 30, 2023. _Credit Risk_ By entering into derivative instrument contracts, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk. Counterparty credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is in an asset position, the counterparty has a liability to the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the Company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. F-47 ----- The following summarizes the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments: The following table presents the status and changes of the Company’s warrants: the amount of the dividend paid, the exercise price was reduced to $0.01 per share, and the Company paid to the holders of these option awards an aggregate cash payment of $16.9 million reflecting the difference between the reduction in the exercise price and the dividend amount. The historical and prospective compensation expense for the modification of the stock option awards was not adjusted as the fair value of the stock option awards after the modification was not greater than the fair value of the stock option awards prior to the modification. The fair value of each stock option award was estimated at the date of grant using a BlackScholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: **2023** Dividend yield . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0% Risk free interest rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.34% Expected lives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.5 years Volatility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24.4% Information with respect to outstanding options is as follows: The following table provides certain information about stock options outstanding at September 30, 2023: The following table presents amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet classified as either operating or finance leases.
