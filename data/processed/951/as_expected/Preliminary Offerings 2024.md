**PRELIMINARY OFFERING CIRCULAR** **CONFIDENTIAL**

#### $750,000,000


# Amwins Group, Inc.


#### % Senior Secured Notes due 2029

Amwins Group, Inc. (the “Company”) is offering $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due
2029 (the “Senior Secured Notes”). The Senior Secured Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per year, payable
semiannually in arrears on and of each year, beginning on, 2024. The Senior Secured Notes will
mature on, 2029.
The Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes at any time on or after,
2026 at the redemption prices specified under “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.” In addition, prior
to, 2026 we may redeem (i) up to 40% of the Senior Secured Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity
offerings at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and (ii) during
each twelve-month period, up to 10% of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may also redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes prior to, 2026 at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date plus a
“make-whole” premium. In addition, if certain kinds of “changes of control” occur, we must offer to purchase the Senior Secured
Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the purchase.
The Senior Secured Notes will be the senior secured obligations of the Company, will rank pari passu in right of payment
with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness, will rank senior in right of payment to its existing and future subordinated
indebtedness, will rank effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the Company and indebtedness
that is secured by junior-priority liens on the Collateral (as defined herein), in each case, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral, and will rank effectively junior to all of the Company’s other indebtedness that is secured by liens on other assets of
the Company that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of those other assets. The Senior Secured Notes will be
fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by the Company’s parent company, Amwins
Holding Company, LLC (“Amwins Holding”), and certain subsidiaries of the Company (the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together
with Amwins Holding, the “Guarantors”). The guarantees will be general secured obligations of each Guarantor and will rank pari
passu in right of payment with all of the Guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, will rank senior in right of payment
to their existing and future subordinated indebtedness, will rank effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured
indebtedness of the Guarantors and indebtedness that is secured by junior-priority liens on the Collateral, in each case, to the
extent of the value of the Collateral, and will rank effectively junior to all of the Guarantors’ other indebtedness that is secured by
liens on other assets of the Guarantors that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of those other assets. The
Senior Secured Notes and guarantees will be secured equally and ratably with the indebtedness under our senior secured credit
facilities by first-priority liens on substantially all of our and our Guarantors’ existing and future assets. The Senior Secured Notes
will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of
the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes—
Security for Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Guarantees.”
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to any registration rights. We do not intend to apply for listing of
the Senior Secured Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Senior Secured Notes in any automated quotation
system.


_Investing in the Senior Secured Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 21._

**Offering Price:** **%, plus accrued interest, if any, from** **, 2024.**
The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
Securities Act, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons (as defined
in Regulation S under the Securities Act, or Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes are being offered and sold only to persons reasonably
believed to be qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, or Rule 144A, and
outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. For more information about
eligible offerees and restrictions on transfers of the Senior Secured Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.”

separate global notes.
The Company expects that delivery of the Senior Secured Notes will be made to investors in book-entry form through the
facilities of DTC on or about, 2024.

**CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering circular includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans,
objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or
may be deemed to be, “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements can generally
be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “estimates,”
“anticipates,” “expects,” “seeks,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will” or “should” or, in each case,
their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include
all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this offering
circular and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning,
among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth and
strategies and the industry in which we operate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to
events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We believe these risks
and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this
offering circular. Those factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the
other cautionary statements in this offering circular.

Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are
reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the
development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or
suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this offering circular. In addition, even if our
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we
operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering circular, those
results or developments may not be indicative of our results or developments in subsequent periods.
Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations are:

   - the loss of the services of our key brokers, underwriters and executive officers;

   - negative changes in premium pricing or the commissions we receive for placing insurance
products;

   - a decline in revenues from supplemental commissions, which by their nature are difficult to
forecast or predict;

   - difficulty collecting our receivables;

   - reductions in insurer capacity;

   - adverse changes in global economic conditions;

   - our inability to successfully acquire businesses, or unanticipated liabilities or poor performance
associated with acquired businesses;

   - our inability to successfully integrate business acquisitions;

   - difficulty in maintaining our corporate culture as we grow;

   - the termination or change in the terms of one or more key programs for which we act as a
managing general agent or underwriter;

   - our inability to place profitable business for the insurance carriers that have given us authority
to place insurance on their behalf, or if our underwriting models contain errors or are otherwise
ineffective, or our underwriters do not demonstrate sufficient skill;

   - damage to our reputation;

v


-----

   - the interruption or loss of our information processing systems;

   - risk associated with having geographically dispersed offices and significant international
operations;

   - our inability to grow organically through opening new offices, hiring new brokers and
underwriters or engaging in business development initiatives;

   - our inability to use, maintain and develop technology to support our business;

   - the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personal information;

   - our inability to take actions that are not supported by our Investors;

   - a change in the way insurance products are distributed;

   - competition in our industry;

   - the loss of customers through consolidation;

   - competition from retail insurance firms who develop or acquire their own wholesale insurance
operations or otherwise obtain direct access to the insurance products we distribute;

   - the failure of third-party service providers to adequately perform services for us;

   - an increase in the cost of our employee benefits plans and programs;

   - loss of access to cash, investment and fiduciary accounts we have with depository institutions
in excess of governmental-insured balances;

   - a failure of our internal controls;

   - changes to the judgments, estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of our financial
statements;

   - impairments to our goodwill or intangible assets;

   - negative changes in U.S. capital markets that affect our ability to borrow;

   - infringement, misappropriation or dilution of our intellectual property or failure to protect our
intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property
rights of others;

   - litigation matters, including errors and omissions claims;

   - our compliance with U.S. and foreign governmental regulation and supervision;

   - changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry;

   - our substantial leverage, as well as restrictions imposed by the credit agreement that governs
our senior secured credit facilities, the indenture that governs our 4.875% Senior Notes and the
Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes that will limit our ability to finance future
operations, acquisitions or capital requirements or engage in other business activities;

   - our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and meet our other
ongoing liquidity needs;

   - our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries to pay interest and principal on the Senior
Secured Notes; and

   - those discussed herein under the caption “Risk Factors.”

Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make in this offering circular

vi


-----

speak only as of the date of those statements, and except as required by law, we undertake no
obligation to update those statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of
those statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of results for current and any
prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless
expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We refer to the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Revenue and organic revenue growth (each, as defined in “Summary—Summary Historical
Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data”) in various places in this offering circular. These
are supplemental financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Any analysis of non-GAAP financial
measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP.

The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of
“non-GAAP financial measures,” such as those mentioned above and ratios related thereto. These
measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules
govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial measures are publicly presented and require, among
other things:

   - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or
measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and

   - a statement disclosing the purposes for which management uses the non-GAAP financial
measure.

The rules prohibit, among other things:

   - the exclusion of charges or liabilities that require, or will require, cash settlement or would have
required cash settlement, absent an ability to settle in another manner, from a non-GAAP
liquidity measure; and

   - the adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as
non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it has
occurred in the past two years or is reasonably likely to recur within the next two years.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering circular may not comply with the
SEC rules governing the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. For example, some of the
adjustments to EBITDA made in connection with calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA presented in this offering circular would not be allowed under SEC rules. Furthermore, certain
of the adjustments and pro forma effects are based on estimates and assumptions, including with
respect to the future performance of our supported offices. While we believe we have a reasonable
basis for these estimates and assumptions, they are subject to change. Actual results could differ from
those estimates and such differences may be material.

We have also presented certain financial information for the last twelve months period ending
September 30, 2023, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe
this presentation provides investors with useful information to assess our recent performance in the
same manner as our management team.

Please see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data”
and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a

further discussion and quantification of non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering circular,
including the reasons we believe this information is useful to management and to investors and
reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable financial measures
calculated in accordance with GAAP.

**FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Unless otherwise specified, financial information in this offering circular is provided for Amwins
Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. This offering circular does not include all of
the information that would be required if we were registering the offering of the Senior Secured Notes
with the SEC. In particular, this offering circular does not include financial information relating to our
segments and our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries or information relating to compensation
paid to our executive officers. In addition, this offering circular does not contain financial information for
Amwins Holding. Amwins Holding has no material assets other than the equity interests in Amwins

**MARKET, RANKING, INDUSTRY DATA AND FORECASTS**

This offering circular includes market share, ranking, industry data and forecasts that we obtained

P&C and specialty niche insurance products they may not have the expertise or ability to place directly.
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our Brokerage division represented approximately
51% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.

**_Access_**

Our Access division focuses on the placement of P&C insurance for small commercial and
personal lines insurance products, primarily through binding authority arrangements with a wide array
of insurance carriers. We launched Access as a stand-alone division in January 2015 to consolidate
our existing small account binding authority business. Since that time, we have expanded Access
through acquisitions and an aggressive recruiting and training program for new underwriters.

Our strategic vision for Access is to efficiently deliver a broad array of options for small
businesses and high net worth individuals. A key driver for success in this division is the ability to
leverage technology to allow our underwriters to quickly deliver an array of coverage options for our
retail clients. We believe we are well on our way to fulfilling this strategic vision. As of September 30,
2023, Access had over 1,100 employees spread across 48 production branches and over 230 teams of
underwriters. Access placed over 500,000 policies annually, most of which involve less than $25,000 in
premium. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our Access division represented
approximately 12% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.

**_Underwriting_**

Through our Underwriting division, we operate a variety of stand-alone specialty insurance
programs. Under these programs, insurance carriers have authorized us to bind coverage on their
behalf as a managing general agent or underwriter (MGU) for a designated type of risk, business or
industry. Our authority to bind insurance is usually subject to underwriting guidelines, policy limits and
pricing parameters that are typically developed jointly by these carriers and us on a collaborative basis
and are specific to each program.

When we serve as an MGU, we generally receive requests for insurance directly from retail
insurance brokers, evaluate the risk based on the information submitted, and decide whether we will
offer a quote for insurance coverage. If our client decides to bind coverage, we issue policies on behalf
of the insurance carriers we represent. Our Underwriting division operates on behalf of insurance
carriers and does not take insurance risk for the policies we bind.

We typically bill and collect premiums on behalf of the insurance carrier. For some of our
programs, we also administer claims. We believe these capabilities further strengthen our relationships
with carriers and retail brokers through a deeper and more connected role in the insurance economic
value chain. In many cases, our insurance carrier partners rely on our product knowledge and access
to targeted risk classes. Certain products we offer within this division are proprietary in nature,
including a property catastrophe product that is only distributed through our Brokerage division.

We have a team of actuaries to support our MGU programs. Our actuarial staff provides actuarial
and catastrophe modeling services to our insurance carrier partners to help monitor the overall


2


-----

profitability of these programs. Our actuaries also monitor the performance of our programs and work
with our underwriters and insurance carriers to develop rate tracking mechanisms, pricing models and
other underwriting tools. Our ability to analyze loss experience for our MGU programs enables us to be
more proactive in adjusting pricing to ensure we are delivering adequate underwriting returns to our
carrier partners.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our Underwriting division represented
approximately 15% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.

**_Group Benefits_**

Our Group Benefits division distributes a range of accident and health benefit products, including
major medical, stop-loss, ancillary, retiree medical and prescription drug insurance products designed
for employers and other member groups, such as trade associations, chambers of commerce, unions
and professional organizations. We serve as a general agent (GA) by providing core and specialty
benefit products to our customers, who include retail benefit brokers and benefit consultants. We also
serve as the exclusive employee benefits program manager in 14 jurisdictions for the largest
professional employer organization (PEO) in the United States. In that role, we underwrite, manage
and administer health and other employee benefit plans for employer groups that join the PEO. In
addition, we distribute a group Medicare supplemental medical plan as well as a Medicare-approved
prescription drug plan under Part D of the Social Security Act, primarily to employer groups that
historically have offered retiree health benefits to their retired employees and are looking for alternative
solutions. Our Group Benefits division provides products and services for over 57,000 employer groups
that encompass over seven million employee lives. Revenue from this division is generated by an array
of brokerage services (distribution of group health and benefit products), third-party administration
services (for carriers, self-funded employer health plan sponsors and insureds), and underwriting
(MGU for niche health and other benefit insurance programs).

We also place and administer a wide array of group benefit products for member organizations.
These products are acquired by national, regional and local member groups that frequently do not
have the capability or desire to administer these plans and that seek ways to make membership in their
organizations more appealing. Through our relationships with insurance carriers, we are able to help
design customized group benefit plans to address the varying needs of these organizations.

We are able to handle virtually all aspects of administering the types of group benefit products we
place, including plan enrollment, eligibility, billing, collection and claims administration. We have made
a substantial investment in several call centers that we use to provide assistance and support for the
plans we administer. We provide administrative services to both insurance carriers and employers for
plans we distribute as well as plans distributed by others.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our Group Benefits division represented
approximately 10% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.

**_International_**

Anchored by our Lloyd’s of London brokerage business, our International division places a wide
variety of P&C and financial risk insurance products to businesses as well as both facultative and
treaty reinsurance products. This division provides specialty insurance and reinsurance brokerage
services in the United States and a number of foreign countries. We have subsidiaries operating in
Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Netherlands, South Korea and the United Kingdom. In addition, we


3


-----

have investments in, or licensing arrangements with, businesses operating in Argentina, Australia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay. Our International division operates under the “Amwins Global
Risks” or “THB” brand names.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our International division represented
approximately 9% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.

**_Our Industry_**

We operate our business within the wholesale insurance distribution market, but place products
associated with the broader P&C and employee benefits insurance markets.

_Property and Casualty Insurance Market._ P&C insurance brokerage is dependent on the
economic performance of the broader P&C insurance market as brokers receive a commission based
on a percentage of the dollar amount of the premiums placed. The volume of premiums placed is a
function of both insurance rates or premium pricing and the underlying amount of coverage purchased.
The amount of coverage purchased is affected by the broader macro-economic conditions within each
market, and there tends to be a high correlation in the United States between GDP growth and the
amount of premiums. Premium pricing is cyclical in nature and varies between “hard” markets in which
premium rates are increasing, as compared to “soft” markets in which rates are declining. Insurance
brokers typically are fee-based businesses that do not assume significant insurance liability risk.

Insurance carriers sell commercial P&C and professional insurance products in the U.S. through
“admitted” insurance carriers, which are carriers that are licensed in the state in which the risk is
located, and “nonadmitted” insurance carriers that sell their products in the E&S lines market. Within
the insurance market, there are standard insurance products and specialty insurance products. For
standard insurance products, insurance rates, forms and coverages are relatively uniform, and
insurance carriers tend to compete for customers primarily on the basis of reputation, financial
strength, price, claims service and commissions. Specialty insurance products are sold to insured
parties with more specialized or complex risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard
insurance products. Although price tends to be a key basis of competition among specialty insurance
carriers, the coverage terms also are an important competitive factor.

_Group Benefits Insurance Market._ Group benefit insurance products are sold by life and health
insurance carriers, which transact business with both wholesale and retail insurance brokers and, in
some cases, directly with the sponsoring organization. Wholesale distributors of group benefit products
generally place specialized group benefit products for unusual, unique or specific types of coverage.
Some wholesale distributors also provide administrative services, such as premium, claims and other
administrative services, to both insurance carriers and sponsoring organizations to support these
products.

_Wholesale Insurance Brokerage Market._ Wholesale insurance brokers act as intermediaries
between insurance carriers and retail insurance brokers by assisting retail brokers place business that
is outside of their core expertise or ability to place directly. Wholesale insurance brokers often provide
retail insurance brokers with specialty and E&S insurance products offered by admitted and
non-admitted insurance carriers. It is not uncommon for retail insurance brokerage firms to use several
wholesale insurance brokerage firms to assist in the placement of insurance. Similarly, insurance
carriers typically distribute their products through multiple wholesale insurance brokerage firms. When
a wholesale broker is used, the wholesale broker will pay a part of its commissions to the retail
insurance broker. In some cases, wholesale insurance brokers act as an MGU for an insurance carrier.


4


-----

An MGU generally has authority to bind coverage on behalf of an insurance carrier for a specific type
of risk, subject to agreed-upon guidelines and limits. An MGU does not, as such, take underwriting
risks for the products that it distributes.

The wholesale distribution channel allows insurance carriers to distribute their products more
efficiently. Insurance carriers use wholesale insurance brokers because of their product expertise and
distribution capabilities, allowing them to reduce or avoid the infrastructure and personnel costs
associated with maintaining relationships with a large number of retail insurance brokerage firms.
Wholesale insurance brokers typically are compensated by commissions paid by the insurance carrier,
although they can also receive fees in addition to commissions for placing certain insurance policies.
Commissions generally are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium for the underlying
insurance policy. Many factors affect commission rates, including the type of insurance, competition
among insurance carriers for that type of insurance, the particular insurance carrier involved, market
cycles and the nature of the services provided by the wholesale insurance broker. When retail
insurance brokers use wholesale insurance brokers to place coverage, they will agree how to split
commissions paid by the insurance carrier. Historically, insurance carriers have frequently paid a
greater commission rate on products distributed through wholesale insurance brokers because of the
expertise provided by wholesale insurance brokers and because insurance carriers have lower
infrastructure and other distribution costs for products distributed through the wholesale distribution
channel. In addition, insurance carriers will sometimes pay wholesale insurance brokers contingent
commissions that depend on the volume or profitability of the business they place for the carrier.

The wholesale insurance brokerage industry has been affected by several macro and micro
changes that have impacted the industry in recent years. Because of consolidation, the industry has
become bifurcated between a few national firms and a large number of smaller regional and local firms.
The national firms are better positioned to work with the largest and most sophisticated carriers due to
a wider breadth of retail broker relationships as well as their technological sophistication. The larger the
wholesale brokerage firm, the more integral they are to the distribution model of the insurance carriers
operating in this segment of the insurance industry. Some specialty insurance carriers have shifted
their focus away from doing business with a large number of retail brokers to selling their products
through targeted distribution to select wholesale insurance brokers who understand their products and
underwriting appetite, which reduces the complexity of their business and shifts costs from fixed to
variable. The retail insurance brokerage industry has seen a large amount of consolidation over
several years as the industry shifts from a high degree of fragmentation to one where several national
platforms have emerged. This trend can have a positive or negative impact on the wholesale
brokerage firms that do business with these retail brokerage firms, depending on their prior relationship
with the consolidating firms and the post-consolidation strategy of the combined firms. Notwithstanding
the substantial consolidation of retail brokerage firms, there are still more than 40,000 retail brokerage
firms operating in the United States.

**_Our Competition_**

The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive. A number of firms actively compete with
us for clients and access to insurance carriers. Our Brokerage and International divisions compete with
a number of other wholesale insurance brokerage firms, some of which are operated by large retail
insurance brokerage firms, banks or financial service companies, as well as retail insurance brokerage
firms and insurance companies. Some of our competitors are owned by customers.

We primarily compete for business on the basis of relationships, reputation, client service,
expertise in a given specialty line, and program and product offerings. Our ability to tailor our products


5


-----

and risk management services to meet the needs of retail insurance brokers can be a key
differentiator.

Our Underwriting and Access divisions compete with a variety of sources for standard and
specialized insurance products that provide coverage similar to the types of products we distribute. In
many cases, our competitors are other insurance carriers that offer similar products. In addition, we
frequently compete with small- to mid-sized wholesale brokerage firms that provide products that are
similar to the products offered by our MGU and binding authority programs.

Although there are no large national wholesale insurance brokerage firms that regularly compete
with our Group Benefits division, we compete with a variety of other businesses, including retail
insurance brokers that distribute products similar to the types of products we distribute, insurance
carriers that distribute these products directly through retail insurance brokers or to insured parties,
benefit consultants who are able to assist in the distribution of these products and a number of other
companies that provide group benefit administrative services. Our Group Benefits division competes
for clients on the basis of product design and pricing, product knowledge and the ability to provide
ancillary administrative services, as well as the cost of these services.

**_Our Strengths_**

_Leading market position, with extensive customer and carrier relationships. Our size and scale_
provide us with a unique position in the wholesale market to better assist our retail insurance
brokerage clients and increase our relevance and position with our insurance carrier partners. As we
increase both our market share with retail brokers and the depth of our relationships with insurance
carriers, we further enhance our value proposition by providing better access to both constituents. We
partner with over 2,500 insurance carriers and markets and maintain more than 34,000 retail brokerage
firm relationships. Our scale and sophistication has led to increasing market clout and enhanced
specialty product knowledge, further enhancing our market leading position. Based on information
published in September 2023 by Business Insurance, we believe we are the largest U.S. P&C
wholesale insurance broker and the second largest U.S. wholesale insurance broker overall based on
premiums placed.

_Diversified business platform._ Our business model is highly diversified by the type of insurance
products offered, the number of carrier and retail broker relationships, and the geographic scope of our
operations globally. We believe our level of diversification helps insulate our business from changes
(both macro and micro) affecting the customers and markets we serve and allows us to generate a
more stable revenue stream. We are not dependent on any retail insurance broker customer (for the
twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, no retail broker customer accounted for more than
6% of our commissions and fees, and our top five retail broker customers accounted for less than 19%
of our commissions and fees) or insurance carrier or market (for the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2023, no individual carrier or market accounted for more than 6% of our premium
volume, and our top five carriers represented approximately 18% of premium volume).

_Proven business model supports sustained growth with robust, recurring cash flow_
_generation._ Our size and scale give us an advantage in terms of our relationships with both our retail
insurance broker clients and our carrier partners. As large retail brokers seek to reduce the number of
wholesale brokers they use, our size and scale make us attractive given the breadth of our access to
carriers and specialty insurance products. Similarly, our size, scale and relationships with retail
brokerage firms make us a key component of the distribution model of insurance carriers that offer the
products we place. Our scale and business flow also enhances our expertise and experience in
specialty risks, allowing us to provide better service to our clients and help our insurance carriers
develop new


6


-----

products. This business model has historically generated steady organic revenue growth (18.8% for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, 16.0% in 2022 and 17.0% in 2021, in each case
compared to the preceding comparable period), expanding Adjusted EBITDA margins (35.4% for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, 34.3% in 2022 and 34.4% in 2021), and solid cash flow
generation.

_Proven consolidator in fragmented industry._ We maintain a broad U.S. and international
platform and have historically used, and expect to continue to use, a disciplined acquisition strategy to
expand our market share, product capabilities, diversification and geographic footprint. We believe this
strategy has enhanced our business and complements our focus on core organic growth and
operational improvement. We are selective about the acquisition targets we pursue. We completed
eight acquisitions since January 1, 2020. We believe our entrepreneurial culture, decentralized
approach to managing our business and centralized support offered by our corporate staff make
Amwins appealing to individuals who have decided to sell their business. Virtually all of the owners of
the businesses we have acquired have remained actively engaged in the business post-acquisition,
which has facilitated the integration of these businesses.

_Experienced management team._ Our Chairman, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer,
President, Chief Financial Officer and division presidents have substantial experience and longstanding relationships developed over an average of more than 20 years of experience in the
insurance industry. Our management team draws on its relationships and experience in the industry to
identify opportunities to expand our business and collaborate with insurance carriers to help develop
products to respond to market trends. Through their extensive relationships in the insurance industry,
our management team also contributes to the successful recruitment of key brokers and underwriters
to join Amwins.

**_Our Strategy_**

_Increase growth by expanding distribution._ We strive to prudently grow our business by
expanding our distribution channels across all of our divisions. Over the last five years, we have hired
over 200 new brokers and underwriters in the United States, excluding brokers hired in connection with
acquisitions. We intend to continue to organically grow our revenue through the addition of new
brokers and underwriters and enhanced penetration of our existing markets. We have generated
organic revenue growth of 18.8% during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and 16.0%,
17.0% and 8.8% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have over 1,200 producers who specialize
in specific product lines or industry classes. We also provide our producers with access to what we
believe is an industry-leading producer training program.

_Access to new markets and products._ We are focused on expanding our access to new
markets and products to better serve the needs of our clients. For example, because certain admitted
insurance carriers will not do business directly with small retail insurance brokerage firms, but will do
business with us, our Access division has acquired a platform to provide these brokerage firms with
access to a greater variety of standard insurance products. We also are actively working to develop
new MGU programs, which represent an attractive growth opportunity given the emergence of
alternative insurance markets and the specialized nature of these programs. In our Group Benefits
division, we continue to explore opportunities to work with our insurance carrier partners to develop
new products that help employers manage the rising cost of health care.

_Focus on operational efficiency and profitability._ We continue to be focused on the efficiency of
our platform and expansion of our underlying profit margins through increased scale and operating
leverage. We use an integrated back-office corporate support team in Charlotte, North Carolina, to


7


-----

provide our client-facing operations with virtually all of the administrative resources they need,
including human resource, legal, information technology (IT), analytical and actuarial services. As a
result, in most instances our growth (either organically or through acquisitions) can be achieved with
relatively limited incremental expense, which drives a high degree of operating leverage. In addition,
we actively look for opportunities to further use technology to support our business, including using our
AmLINK platform to expand our data and analytics capabilities.

_Pursue opportunistic acquisitions._ We plan to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in a disciplined
manner that will complement our existing business or help us expand into new wholesale distribution
channels or markets. We have substantial experience in selecting and integrating acquisition targets
and are positioned to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that arise. We believe that our
entrepreneurial and operating culture make us an attractive partner to acquisition targets.

**_Recent Unaudited Estimated Results of Operations_**
For the three months ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that our total revenues were
between $663.2 million and $667.2 million, our EBITDA was between $215.6 million and $219.6 million
and our Adjusted EBITDA was between $235.1 million and $239.1 million. After giving effect to the
issuance of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby (and assuming we use a portion of the proceeds
and cash on hand to pay restricted payments of $1.05 billion as described in “Use of Proceeds”), and
using the mid-point of our estimated range of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, we estimate that our total
net debt-to-Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2023 is 4.88x (or 4.98x after giving effect
to the Acquisitions (as defined below)). Our estimated total net debt-to-Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as
of December 31, 2023 is based on the estimated as adjusted indebtedness outstanding of
$4,907.8 million, the estimated as adjusted amount of cash balances of $466.7 million (or
$299.9 million after funding the Acquisitions) and $909.5 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (or
$925.1 million after giving effect to the Acquisitions) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023,
representing the midpoint of management’s estimate of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for such period of
$907.5 million to $911.5 million. We also estimate that our Pro Forma Revenues for the twelve-month
period ended December 31, 2023 were $2,561.8 million, representing the midpoint of management’s
estimate of Pro Forma Revenues for such period of $2,559.8 million and $2,563.8 million.

We have entered into agreements to acquire two businesses (the “Acquisitions”), one of which
closed on January 31, 2024 and the other of which is expected to be completed by March 31, 2024.
The closing purchase price for these Acquisitions is payable in cash in the aggregate amount of
$166.8 million and units of Amwins Holding. Based on historical financial information provided by
management of these businesses, we estimate that these businesses represent an additional
annualized EBITDA of $15.6 million in the aggregate. We have based our estimate of the historical
EBITDA generated by these businesses entirely on information provided by management of these
businesses. Although we believe this information is accurate in all material respects, this information
cannot be independently verified by us and has not been independently reviewed or audited.
Accordingly, we have presented this information solely for informational purposes. In addition,
information shown above with respect to our combined Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA after giving effect
to these Acquisitions is not necessarily indicative of our combined results of operations that would have
been achieved if we had acquired these businesses on or before January 1, 2023, nor is it necessarily
indicative of our future results. Moreover, although we expect to complete the second Acquisition on
the terms set forth above, this Acquisition is subject to closing conditions, some of which are outside of
our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that this acquisition will be completed or, if completed,
will be on the terms set forth above.

The estimated December 31, 2023 results are as of the date hereof and are preliminary,
unaudited and subject to completion, reflect management’s current views and may change as a result


8


-----

of management’s review of results and other factors, including a wide variety of significant business,
economic and competitive risks and uncertainties. Such estimated results are subject to the closing
and finalization of financial and accounting procedures for the period (which have yet to be performed)
and should not be viewed as a substitute for full financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. While we do not expect that our actual results for the three months ended December 31, 2023
or for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023 will vary materially from the estimated
results, there can be no assurance that these estimates will be realized. Due to the preliminary nature
of these estimates, we are unable to reconcile the non-GAAP measures set forth above to net income
attributable to Amwins Group, Inc., which would be the most directly comparable measure under
GAAP, because such information is unavailable at this time. The preliminary financial data included in
this offering circular has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Amwins Group, Inc.
management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled, nor
applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the preliminary financial data. Accordingly,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. As a result, prospective investors should exercise caution in relying on this information and
should not draw any inferences from this information regarding financial or operating data not provided
in this offering circular. In addition, our preliminary estimates are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be achieved in any future period. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those
described above are set forth in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements” and
“Risk Factors.”

**_Our Ownership_**

Amwins Holding currently owns 100% of our outstanding shares of capital stock. In addition, we
have a stock option plan under which, as of December 31, 2023, there were outstanding options to
purchase 781,009 shares of our nonvoting common stock.

Amwins Holding is a Delaware limited liability company, and equity interests in Amwins Holding
are denominated in units. The beneficial owners of Amwins Holdings comprise four groups: Employee/
Owners, the Dragoneer/SkyKnight Group, PSP Investments and Genstar Capital. In November 2023,
Amwins Holding completed an equity recapitalization in which the Dragoneer/SkyKnight Group and
Genstar Capital increased their respective ownership percentages of Amwins Holding by purchasing
units of Amwins Holding from certain Employee/Owners who elected to sell a portion of their units and
PSP Investments, which retained a significant ownership interest in Amwins Holding. See “Related
Party Transactions—November 2023 Equity Recapitalization” for more information.

As of December 31, 2023, the Employee/Owners beneficially owned approximately 41.3% of the
outstanding units of Amwins Holding, the Dragoneer/SkyKnight Group beneficially owned
approximately 33.1% of the outstanding units of Amwins Holding, PSP Investments beneficially owned
approximately 16.4% of the outstanding units of Amwins Holding, and Genstar Capital beneficially
owned approximately 9.2% of the outstanding units of Amwins Holding.

We encourage and have taken steps to increase the level of employee ownership of Amwins
Holding. As of December 31, 2023, there were over 1,450 current and former employees who owned
units of Amwins Holding. We have a Unit Purchase Plan under which we offer qualified employees the
opportunity annually to purchase units in Holding. We typically encounter demand to purchase equity
under this plan that exceeds plan limitations.

plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, with
the net proceeds raised by us or Amwins Holding
in one or more equity offerings, as long as:

                           - we redeem the Senior Secured Notes within
180 days of completing the equity offering;
and

                             - at least 50% of the aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes issued
remains outstanding afterwards.

In addition, during each twelve-month period
before, 2026, we may redeem up to
10% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price
equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the date of redemption.

Prior to, 2026, we may redeem the
Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at a
price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus the make-whole premium described
under “Description of Senior Secured Notes—
Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the redemption date.

Change of control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If certain kinds of “change of control” occur, we
must offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes
at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued
interest. For more details, you should read
“Description of Senior Secured Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change
of Control.”

Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture that will govern the Senior
Secured Notes will contain certain covenants
that, among other things, limit our ability and the
ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

                             - pay dividends or distributions, repurchase
equity, prepay junior debt and make certain
investments;

                              - incur additional debt or issue certain
disqualified stock and preferred stock;

                              - incur liens on assets;


13


-----

                           - merge or consolidate with another company
or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
its assets;

                               - enter into transactions with affiliates; and

                               - allow to exist certain restrictions on the
ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or
make other payments to us.

These covenants are subject to important
exceptions and qualifications as described under
“Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain
Covenants.” Certain covenants will cease to
apply to the Senior Secured Notes for so long as
the Senior Secured Notes have investment
grade ratings from both Moody’s Investor
Service, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings.

Absence of established market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Senior Secured Notes are a new class of
securities for which there is currently no
established market. Although the Initial
Purchasers have indicated that they intend to
make a market in the Senior Secured Notes, the
Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so, and
may discontinue market making activities at any
time without notice. Accordingly, a liquid market
for the Senior Secured Notes may not develop or
may not be maintained.

Transfer restrictions; No registration rights . . . . . . . The Senior Secured Notes have not been and
will not be registered under the Securities Act
and may not be offered or sold except pursuant
to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. The absence of registration rights
may adversely impact the transferability of the
Senior Secured Notes. See “Transfer
Restrictions,” “Plan of Distribution” and “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured
Notes—Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will
not be entitled to registration rights, and we do
not intend to register the Senior Secured Notes
under applicable securities laws. There are
restrictions on your ability to transfer and resell
the Senior Secured Notes without registration
under applicable securities laws.”

Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We intend to use the proceeds from this offering,
together with cash on hand, (i) to pay all related
transaction fees and expenses, which we
estimate to be approximately $11.0 million, (ii) to
make restricted payments of approximately


14


-----

$1.05 billion, to the extent permitted by our
senior secured credit facilities, the Indenture and
the indenture governing our 4.875% Senior
Notes, and (iii) for general corporate purposes,
including funding pending and future
acquisitions. The Company intends to determine
the amount of any restricted payments to be
made with the proceeds from this offering based
on acquisition opportunities available to it and
the funds that would be required to pursue such
opportunities. Such restricted payments may be
in the form of a dividend payable to Amwins
Holding, which may use these funds to declare a
pro rata distribution payable to its owners, and
payments to certain holders of stock options of
Amwins Group and unvested units of Amwins
Holding required in connection with such a
dividend.

Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . See “Risk Factors” and the other information in

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Senior Secured Notes involves a significant degree of risk. You should_
_carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this_
_offering circular, before you decide whether to purchase the Senior Secured Notes. The risks and_
_uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our_
_financial condition and operating results. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our financial_
_condition and operating results would suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking_
_statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in those forward-_
_looking statements. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

**_The loss of the services of any of our highly qualified brokers and underwriters or our_**
**_executive officers could harm our business and operating results._**

Our future performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly qualified brokers and
underwriters, including brokers and underwriters who work in the businesses that we have acquired or
may acquire in the future. Competition for productive brokers and underwriters is intense, and our
inability to recruit or retain these individuals could harm our business and operating results. Although
many of our senior brokers and underwriters own an equity interest in Amwins Holding and have
entered into employment agreements with us, we cannot assure you that these persons will remain in
our employment. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any of the brokers or underwriters who leave
our firm will comply with the provisions of their employment agreements (or other agreements with us)
that preclude them from competing with us or soliciting our customers and employees or that these
provisions will be sufficient to fully protect us from the loss of any business.

The law governing non-compete agreements varies from state to state, and some states have
recently introduced or passed legislation limiting or even prohibiting the use of non-compete
agreements. For example, in California a law enacted in September 2023 prohibits employers from
entering into or attempting to enforce non-compete agreements. In addition, in January 2023 the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would prohibit
employers from using non-compete agreements. If enacted, the FTC’s proposed rule would prohibit
employers like us from implementing non-compete agreements with our personnel. If this proposed
rule were to become finalized or jurisdictions in which we operate separately adopt similar laws or
regulations, or our non-compete or non-solicit agreements are otherwise deemed unenforceable, we
would be unable to prevent former employees from competing with us, which could potentially leave us
unable to replace a departing employee with an equally qualified individual who is acceptable to our
customers and business partners.

Our success also depends on our key executive officers and the skills and relationships they
bring to our business, as well as on our ability to attract and retain additional executive officers and key
management personnel. Most of our executive officers have a number of years of experience with our
company and in the insurance industry generally. The loss of the services of any of our executive
officers, or our inability to attract and retain additional executive officers or key management personnel,
could harm our business and operating results.

**_We may be negatively affected by changes in the amount of premiums charged and_**
**_commissions paid for the insurance products we place._**

Premium pricing within the commercial property and casualty insurance market in which we
operate historically has been cyclical based on the underwriting capacity of the insurance carriers

21


-----

operating in this market and has been impacted by general economic conditions. In a period of
decreasing insurance capacity, insurance carriers typically increase premium rates. This type of market
frequently is referred to as a “hard” market. In a period of increasing insurance capacity, insurance
carriers tend to reduce premium rates. This type of market frequently is referred to as a “soft” market.
Because our commission rates usually are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium charged
for the insurance products that we place, our revenues are affected by the pricing cycle of the market.
The frequency and severity of natural disasters and other catastrophic events can affect the timing,
duration and extent of industry cycles for many of the product lines we distribute. It is very difficult to
predict the severity, timing or duration of these cycles. The cyclical nature of premium pricing in the
commercial property and casualty insurance market may make our operating results volatile and
unpredictable.

Business conditions generally and within the insurance industry also may affect:

   - The commission rates paid by insurance carriers on products we distribute;

   - The portion of commissions we receive from insurance carriers that we pay to our retail
insurance brokerage clients in connection with the placement of insurance policies. The
amount of these commissions often is negotiated on a case-by-case basis and can be affected
by a number of factors, including the amount of business that a retail insurance brokerage firm
places with us, competition within the wholesale insurance brokerage market, whether the retail
insurance broker is being compensated by its client on a fee basis and the difficulty of obtaining
insurance to cover a particular risk;

   - The fees we charge for certain insurance products we distribute, which are in addition to the
commissions we receive and often are negotiated on a case-by-case basis; and

   - The fees we are able to charge for providing ancillary services such as premium and claims
administration and actuarial services.

Our Group Benefits division derives a substantial majority of its revenues from group health
insurance plans. Premium rates for group health insurance plans are affected by several factors,
including health care costs and general economic conditions such as changes in the level of
employment and other factors that may affect employer spending for employee benefits. Federal and
state sponsored health care programs (including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
2010) as well as proposals to alter the level of spending under these programs also can affect the
market for group health insurance plans.

**_Supplemental commissions can vary and are difficult to forecast, and a reduction in the amount_**
**_of supplemental commissions we receive may negatively affect our business and operating_**
**_results._**

Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by certain insurance carriers based on the
profitability, premium growth, total premium volume or some combination of these factors for business
we place with these carriers. Approximately 5.6% of our total revenues for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023 was attributable to contingent commissions. Supplemental commissions can vary
from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of our receipt of payments or information from carriers
related to the supplemental commissions we earn. In many cases we have little or no control over the
amount of supplemental commissions we receive or the process by which insurance carriers estimate
loss reserves, which affects the amount of supplemental commissions we may receive. Thus, it is
difficult for us to predict or forecast the amount of supplemental commissions we will receive. If we are
unable to meet insurance carriers’ profitability or volume goals, or if insurance carriers increase their
estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control, actual payments we receive may be less than

22


-----

anticipated. Because supplemental commissions directly affect our revenue and profitability, any
decrease in the amount paid to us could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

**_If we are unable to collect our receivables, our results of operations and cash flows could be_**
**_adversely affected._**

Our business depends on our ability to obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe
us for the insurance policies we place. As of September 30, 2023, our premiums receivable were
approximately $1.5 billion, or approximately 21.0% of our total assets, and portions of our receivables
are concentrated in certain businesses and geographies.

Macroeconomic or political conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients and
insurance carrier trading partners, which could cause clients to delay payments to us, request
modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on
their payment obligations to us.

**_Our business, and therefore our results of operations and financial condition, may be adversely_**
**_affected by conditions that result in reduced insurance capacity._**

Our ability to serve our clients depends on the capacity of insurance carriers and other riskbearing businesses to underwrite risk and provide coverage, which depends in certain cases on their
ability to procure reinsurance. The cost and availability of insurance and reinsurance are dependent on
the profitability of a particular class or type of insurance, which can be affected by many factors
including the frequency and severity of storms, natural disasters, catastrophic events and other factors.
Capacity could contract if one or more insurance carriers became insolvent or decided to limit or
eliminate the issuance of certain types of insurance we place for our clients or the locations where
certain types of insurance are offered. We have no control over these matters. To the extent insurance
or reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive, we may not be able to
procure the amount or types of coverage that our clients desire, and the coverage we are able to
procure for our clients may be too expensive or more limited than is acceptable.

**_Global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects,_**
**_operating results, financial condition and cash flows._**

Our business and operating results may be materially affected by global economic conditions.
Recently, concerns about the global economic outlook have adversely affected economic markets and
business conditions in general. Geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and
economic sanctions related thereto and the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas, and rising
interest rates have adversely affected many aspects of the global economy. Sustained or worsening of
these and other global economic conditions, including as a result of pandemics or other outbreaks of
contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations. While it is difficult to predict the effects of a deterioration in global
economic conditions on our business, any significant reduction or delay by businesses in purchasing
insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Price inflation has also resulted in market volatility and uncertainty for global commerce. We have
encountered an increase in certain of our operating costs as a result of price inflation. Although we are
currently unable to determine to what extent continued inflation may impact us, future price increases
may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Moreover, the effects of inflation may
have a material adverse impact on insurance carriers, which in turn may materially and negatively

23


-----

affect the results of our operations. In addition, increased interest rates stemming from efforts to
combat inflation have caused our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness to
increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows,
including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, to decrease correspondingly.

Moreover, should a significant insurance carrier fail, be downgraded or withdraw from writing
certain lines of insurance coverages we offer our clients, overall capacity in the industry could be
negatively impacted, which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance.
The failure or downgrading of an insurance carrier could also result in errors and omissions claims
against us. All of these scenarios could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability.

**_If we are unable to successfully acquire businesses, or if they do not perform as we expect, our_**
**_competitiveness, operating results and financial condition could be harmed._**

One of our growth strategies is to acquire businesses that complement, expand upon or diversify
our current operations. We have acquired over 55 businesses since January 1, 2002 (including eight
since January 1, 2020), and we anticipate that we will continue to look for opportunities to acquire
additional businesses. For example, we have entered into agreements to acquire two businesses, one
of which closed on January 31, 2024 and the other of which is expected to be completed by March 31,
2024. Competition for new acquisitions is intense, which has tended to increase the purchase price
paid for acquisitions. We are unable to predict whether or when we will be able to identify suitable
acquisition candidates, consummate any acquisitions we pursue or prevail over our acquisition
competitors, who may be larger than we are and may have greater resources than we do. If we need
additional capital to complete acquisitions we desire to pursue, we may be unable to secure such
capital on satisfactory terms. Our senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing our 4.875%
Senior Notes and the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes limit the amount of additional
debt we may incur. Our ability to secure future financing would depend on a number of factors, some of
which are beyond our control, such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets, our operating
performance and then-existing debt levels and cash flows. If we are unable to continue to acquire other
businesses, it is likely that our revenue and earnings growth will be negatively affected.

Despite due diligence investigations we conduct before acquiring a business, we may not
succeed in identifying all material risks and uncertainties associated with that business. Unanticipated
contingencies or liabilities, such as litigation, the loss of significant clients or accounts, the termination
or amendment of significant contracts and the loss of key brokers or employees, are inherent risks in
acquisitions. Furthermore, businesses that we acquire may not achieve expected levels of revenue,
profitability or productivity or otherwise operate in a manner consistent with our expectations or
comparable to our existing businesses due to events beyond our control, such as changes in market
conditions, increased competition and other factors. The failure of the businesses that we acquire to
achieve our performance goals could have an adverse impact on our operating results and overall
business.

When we acquire an entity, a portion of the purchase price may be allocated to goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets. The amount of purchase price allocated to goodwill and other
intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of
identifiable net assets we acquire. Accounting rules require that we conduct annual impairment testing
of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Deterioration in our operating results, including the
loss of a significant client or clients at one of our acquired businesses, could result in an impairment of
goodwill and intangible assets, which would cause us to record a non-cash charge for the impairment.
Although such a charge would be a non-cash charge, it could nevertheless adversely affect our
reported results of operations.

24


-----

**_If we are unable to successfully integrate businesses we acquire, our competitiveness,_**
**_operating results and financial condition could be harmed._**

We cannot assure you that we can successfully integrate the businesses we acquire. The
integration of a business involves a number of factors that may affect our operations. These factors
include:

   - retention of personnel;

   - diversion of management’s attention;

   - difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, systems and processes;

   - entry into new or unfamiliar markets;

   - unanticipated problems or liabilities; and

   - tax and accounting issues.

To date, we believe we have been successful in integrating the businesses we have acquired
without material disruption to our existing business or the acquired businesses. We nevertheless may
encounter issues associated with integrating existing businesses or new acquisitions in the future. Our
failure to integrate successfully businesses we have acquired may disrupt our operations and harm our
overall business and operating results.

We permit many of our acquired businesses to remain under the day-to-day oversight of previous
owners or other individuals who played a key role in the development of the business. We cannot
predict how long these individuals will continue to be actively engaged in our business. In many cases,
the reputation and skills of these individuals and the relationships they have with employees and other
business partners are critical to our success. Our business and operating results could be harmed if
any of these individuals retire or otherwise limit their involvement in the day-to-day management of our
business and we are not able to identify a suitable successor.

**_If we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, our business may be harmed._**

We believe our corporate culture, including our management philosophy, has been a critical
component to our success and has created among our employees a bond and shared commitment to
our business and an environment that encourages teamwork and the collaborative pursuit of business
opportunities. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. As we grow, both
organically and through acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture.

We believe our culture will be a key component of our future success and our ability to retain and
recruit personnel, expand the products and services we offer, and execute on our business strategy. If
we are unable to preserve our corporate culture, it could materially impair our ability to recruit, hire,
train, manage and integrate new employees, retain existing employees, pursue opportunities to expand
our business, and service and attract new clients, all of which would materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If any of our key MGU or binding authority programs are terminated or changed, our business_**
**_and operating results could be harmed._**

In our Access and Underwriting divisions, we act on behalf of insurance carriers that have given
us authority to bind coverage on their behalf as a managing general agent or underwriter (MGU) or
pursuant to binding authority arrangements. Our MGU and binding authority programs are governed by
contracts between us and the applicable insurance carrier. These contracts establish, among other

25


-----

things, the underwriting and pricing guidelines for the program, the scope of our authority and our
commission rates for policies that we underwrite under the program. These contracts typically can be
terminated by the insurance carrier with little advance notice. Moreover, upon expiration of the contract
term, insurance carriers may request changes to the terms of the program, including the amount of
commissions we receive, which could reduce our revenues from the program. The termination of one
or more of our key MGU or binding authority programs, or a change in the terms of these programs,
could harm our business and operating results. We cannot assure you that we will be able to replace
any MGU or binding authority programs that are terminated with a similar program with another
insurance carrier.

**_If we are unable to place profitable business for the insurance carriers that have given us_**
**_authority to place insurance on their behalf, whether as an MGU or pursuant to binding_**
**_authority arrangements, or if our underwriting models contain errors or are otherwise_**
**_ineffective or our underwriters do not demonstrate sufficient skill, our reputation and_**
**_relationships with insurance carriers could be harmed._**

Our ability to serve as an MGU or pursuant to binding authority arrangements on behalf of our
insurance carrier partners depends on our ability to effectively evaluate risks in accordance with
insurance carrier underwriting policies and place profitable business on their behalf. When we place
insurance on behalf of our insurance carrier partners, we rely on the skills and expertise of our
underwriters developed over years of experience with certain industries or types of insurance products,
as well as the utilization of proprietary underwriting models and third-party tools. If our underwriters do
not perform with the expected level of skill, or any of the models or tools that we use contain
programming or other errors or otherwise are ineffective, or the data provided by clients or third parties
is incorrect or stale, or if we are unable to obtain accurate data from clients or third parties, our pricing
and approval process could be negatively affected, resulting in potential violations of underwriting
authority and the loss of business and insurance programs. This could damage our reputation and
relationships with insurance carriers, retail brokers and agents, which could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our ability to attract and retain clients, employees, investors, capital and insurance carrier trading
partners is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness,
business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity
regarding these matters could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing
and potential clients which in turn could make it difficult for us to maintain existing clients and attract
new ones. Damage to our reputation due to a failure to proactively communicate to stakeholders on
changes in strategy and business plans could further affect the confidence of our clients, regulators,
creditors, investors, insurance carrier trading partners and other parties that are important to our
business. Further, as part of our role in distributing insurance products and services, we rely on trusted
trading partners to provide risk-bearing insurance capital, collect and transmit funds and provide other
products and services. Failure by us or our partners to maintain the confidence of our clients,
regulators, creditors, investors and other parties may have a material adverse effect on our business,
ability to raise capital, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Interruption or loss of our information processing systems could harm our business._**

The operation of our business depends on our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage
significant databases and expand and upgrade periodically our information processing capabilities.
Interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through loss of stored data, breakdown or
malfunctioning of computer equipment and software systems, telecommunications failure, or damage

26


-----

caused by terrorist activities, cybersecurity attacks, fire, tornadoes, lightning, electrical power outage,
natural or other disasters or other disruption could harm our business and operating results. Although
we have disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against certain contingencies,
we cannot assure you that our recovery procedures will be effective or that our insurance will continue
to be available at reasonable prices, cover all such losses or compensate us for the loss of business
occurring during any period in which we are unable to provide services.

While we manage some of our information technology systems and some are outsourced to third
parties, all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage, breakdown or
interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyberattacks, ransomware, malware,
security breaches, theft or misuse, unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees,
sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors, natural disasters, terrorism, war,
telecommunication and electrical failures or other compromise. The techniques and sophistication used
to conduct cyberattacks and compromise information technology infrastructure, as well as the sources
and targets of these attacks, change and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or
have been in place for some time. In addition, there has been an increase in state-sponsored
cyberattacks, which are often conducted by capable, well-funded groups. The adoption of artificial
intelligence technologies amplifies these concerns. Certain businesses we have acquired have been
subject to ransomware and other cybersecurity breaches. We have taken measures to protect against
any future attacks and disruptions on our information technology systems. Nevertheless, because the
techniques used to infiltrate or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate
these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.

If we are unable to maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs
and certain aspects of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. While we
select our third-party vendors carefully, cyberattacks and security breaches at a client or vendor could
adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct
our business and could put our systems at risk. For example, in 2023, one of our vendors suffered a
data breach that resulted in the unauthorized access of certain personal information of almost all of our
U.S.-based employees. Although we do not currently believe that this incident presents a material risk
to us, incidents like this may subject us to litigation or financial loss. Additionally, we are an acquisitive
organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is
complex and exposes us to additional risk. We might not adequately identify weaknesses in our
acquired businesses’ information systems, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our
own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us, our clients or third-party
vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen,
including client, employee or company data. In addition, we may not be able to detect breaches in our
information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner.

We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network
security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant and extended disruption in the
functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose
clients, adversely impact our operations and operating results, and require us to incur significant
expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. In order to maintain the level of
security, service, compliance and reliability our clients and the laws of various jurisdictions require, we
will be required to make significant investments in our information technology systems on an ongoing
basis.

**_Our offices are geographically dispersed across the United States and in the foreign countries_**
**_in which we operate, and we may not be able to detect or respond quickly to operational,_**
**_financial or other problems or promote the desired level of cooperation and interaction among_**
**_our offices, which could harm our business and operating results._**

As of December 31, 2023, we had offices in over 120 locations in the United States and over 20
locations in 12 foreign countries. Substantially all of these offices are under the day-to-day
management of individuals who previously owned businesses we have acquired or played a key role in
the development of an office. These individuals may not report negative developments that occur in
their businesses to management on a timely basis because of concerns regarding, among other things,
damage to their reputation, the risk that they may lose all or some of their operational control, the risk
that it could impair financial earnouts or incentive compensation, or the risk that they may be personally
liable to us under the indemnification provisions of the agreements pursuant to which their businesses
were acquired. Moreover, there can be no assurance that management will be able to independently
detect adverse developments that occur in particular offices.

We review the financial performance of our offices on a monthly basis, maintain frequent contact
with all of our offices and work with our offices on an annual basis to prepare a detailed operating
budget by office. Although we believe that these and other measures have allowed us generally to
detect and address known operational issues that might have a material effect on our operating results,
they may not detect all issues in time to permit us to take appropriate corrective action. Our business
and operating results may be harmed if our management does not become aware, on a timely basis, of
negative business developments, such as the possible loss of an important client, threatened litigation
or regulatory action or other developments.

In addition, our ability to grow organically will require the cooperation of the individuals who
manage our offices. We cannot assure you that these individuals will cooperate with our efforts to
improve the operating results in offices for which they are not directly responsible. Our dispersed
operations may impede our integration efforts and organic growth, which could harm our business and
operating results.

**_Our international operations expose us to various risks that could adversely affect us._**

In addition to our operations in the United States, we also conduct business in foreign countries,
including in Europe, Latin America, Asia and Bermuda. We are subject to legal, economic and market
risks associated with operating in, and sourcing from, foreign countries, including:

   - retention of personnel;

   - general economic and political conditions in foreign countries, including acts of terrorism or the
outbreak of war;

   - the imposition of controls or limitations on the transfer of funds or remittance of dividends and
other payments by foreign subsidiaries;

   - the imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments from
subsidiaries;

   - the imposition of or increase in restrictions on investments in foreign countries by foreign
governments;

   - adverse trade policies or adverse changes to trade policies;

   - difficulties in controlling operations and monitoring employees in geographically dispersed and
culturally diverse locations;

28


-----

   - increases in the cost of doing business, including employee costs, in our foreign offices; and

   - the potential costs and difficulties of complying, or monitoring compliance, with a wide variety of
foreign laws and regulations (some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law) and
laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad, including rules relating to
trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Union,
the United Kingdom and the United Nations, and the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act as well as other anti-bribery and anti-corruption rules and requirements in the
countries in which we operate.

In addition, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These
exposures may change over time, and they could have an adverse impact on our financial results and
cash flows. We face transactional exposure between the U.S. dollar revenue and British Pound
expense in our International division, where a significant part of our revenue is denominated in U.S.
dollars while a substantial portion of our operating expenses is denominated in British Pounds.
Therefore, a stronger U.S. dollar in relation to the British Pound would produce more profitable results
in our consolidated financial statements, and a weaker U.S. dollar would have the opposite result.
Additionally, we have exposure to other currencies, which creates additional exchange rate risk for us.
Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign
exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate these risks. Consequently, changes in exchange rates
may adversely affect our financial results.

**_Our growth strategy involves opening new offices, hiring new brokers and underwriters and_**
**_pursuing new business development initiatives, some of which will require substantial_**
**_investment by us and may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in a_**
**_particular period and the success of which cannot be guaranteed._**

Our ability to grow organically depends in part on our ability to open new offices, recruit new
brokers and underwriters and pursue business development initiatives to complement or expand our
existing business operations. We may not be successful in our efforts to open new offices, hire new
brokers or underwriters or initiate new business development initiatives. The costs of opening a new
office and hiring the necessary personnel to staff the office can be substantial, and we often are
required to commit to multi-year, non-cancellable lease agreements. In addition, we often hire new
brokers and underwriters with the expectation that they will not become profitable until they have
worked with us for a period of time. The cost of investing in new offices, brokers, underwriters and
business development initiatives may affect our results of operations and cash flows in a particular
period. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover our investment in these growth
initiatives or that they will be profitable.

**_Our inability to maintain effective technology to support our business or to identify, procure_**
**_and deploy new technology in a timely and cost-effective manner in response to technological_**
**_changes affecting the insurance brokerage industry could negatively affect our business and_**
**_operating results._**

We rely heavily on technology in the operation of certain parts of our business. In particular, the
success of the small account business conducted by Access depends in part on our ability to efficiently
utilize technology as a key component of the placement and administrative process. We utilize
technological systems, some of which were developed internally by us (such as AmLINK) or
businesses we have acquired, to process the placement of insurance products and to provide some of
the administrative services we offer.

We believe our future success will depend on our ability to continue to use technology to operate
our business in a cost-effective and profitable manner, as well as our ability to respond to technological

29


-----

changes that may occur. These may include new applications or insurance-related services based on
artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain or new approaches to data mining. We may be
exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established
market participants (for example, through disintermediation) or new entrants such as technology
companies, Insurtech start-up companies and others. We must also develop and implement
technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with
rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control
standards. It is unclear how rapidly developing technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine
learning will affect our industry, but the effects may be significant. We may not be successful in
anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and our ideas
may not be accepted in the marketplace. Our inability to maintain effective technological systems to
support our existing operations or identify, acquire and deploy new technology in response to
technological advances affecting our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.

**_The disclosure of confidential or personal information could negatively affect our business._**

In the course of conducting our business, we develop or acquire information that is considered to
be confidential and proprietary about, among other things, current and prospective business partners
(and their clients and other business partners), acquisition targets and our and their employees. This
information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, and financial
information. We frequently are responsible for keeping this information confidential, and are subject to
data privacy laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of this
information. Although we have safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this
information, access to this information may nevertheless be subject to hacking, theft, computer viruses,
misconduct by employees, consultants and third-party service providers, other intrusions and other
intentional or inadvertent actions by persons with access to this information. In addition, third parties to
whom we outsource responsibility for certain aspects of our business may similarly be prone to the risk
of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information. If this information is subject to unauthorized
disclosure, we may be held responsible for breaching privacy laws, rules or agreements. It may also
require us to incur substantial costs to remediate the problem, result in litigation, civil penalties,
governmental investigations or adverse publicity and have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, privacy laws and regulations change from time to time and are inconsistent among the
countries and states in which we conduct our business. Our failure to adhere to these requirements
could subject us to liability for fines or damages and negatively affect our reputation.

**_The Dragoneer/SkyKnight Group and Genstar Capital have substantial influence over matters_**
**_involving us. The Dragoneer/SkyKnight Group and Genstar Capital may have interests that are_**
**_different from yours and may make decisions that are adverse to your interests._**

The Dragoneer/SkyKnight Group and Genstar Capital currently own a majority of the outstanding
equity of Amwins Holding and have the right to appoint five (out of ten) of the managers of Amwins
Holding (the “Managers”). In addition, under the operating agreement of Amwins Holding, each
Investor also has the separate right to approve certain transactions, even if these transactions are
otherwise favored by a majority of our owners or the Managers, including:

   - the sale of a significant equity interest in us or Amwins Holding;

   - the incurrence (or guarantee) of indebtedness in excess of certain levels;

   - acquisitions or dispositions in excess of certain amounts; and

   - any action by Amwins Holding to voluntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind up its business.

30


-----

As a result, the Investors have substantial influence over (and in some cases, a right to veto)
certain matters involving us. The Dragoneer/SkyKnight Group and Genstar Capital may have interests
that differ from yours and may act in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your
interests.

**_If insurance carriers begin to transact more business without relying on wholesale insurance_**
**_brokers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would suffer._**

As a distributor of specialty insurance products, we act as an intermediary between retail
insurance brokers and insurance carriers that, in some cases, will not transact business directly with
retail insurance brokers. If insurance carriers change the way they conduct business and begin to
transact more business directly with retail insurance brokers, our role in the distribution of insurance
products could be eliminated or substantially reduced, and our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows would suffer. Such a change could result from a change in business model,
advancements in technology or other factors.

**_Competition in the markets in which we do business is intense. If we are unable to compete_**
**_effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed._**

The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive. A number of firms actively compete with
us for clients and access to insurance markets. Our competition includes other retail and wholesale
insurance brokerage firms, insurance carriers, banks and other financial service companies.
Furthermore, we and our customers compete with various other companies that provide risk-related
services or alternatives to traditional insurance services, including Insurtech start-up companies that
are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, digital platforms, data
analytics and blockchain, to simplify and improve the client experience, increase efficiencies, alter
business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate.
Moreover, some of our primary competitors have substantially greater resources than we have, which
may give them an advantage over us. Our ability to remain competitive will largely determine our future
success. If we fail to compete successfully, our business and operating results would be adversely
affected.

**_We may lose clients or business as a result of consolidation within the retail insurance_**
**_brokerage industry._**

We derive a substantial portion of our business from our relationships with small- to mid-sized
retail insurance brokerage firms. There has been considerable consolidation in the retail insurance
brokerage industry, driven primarily by the acquisition of small and mid-size retail insurance brokerage
firms by larger brokerage firms, financial institutions or other organizations. We expect this trend to
continue. As a result, we may lose all or a substantial portion of the business we obtain from retail
insurance brokerage firms that are acquired by other firms with their own wholesale insurance
brokerage operations or preferred relationships with wholesale insurance brokerage firms other than
us.

**_We may lose business if certain customers acquire a wholesale insurance broker or otherwise_**
**_reduce the amount of business they conduct with us._**

Many of our retail insurance brokerage customers use us to place products they cannot place
directly, either because of a lack of expertise or inability to access certain insurance markets. If these
customers acquire a wholesale insurance firm or otherwise obtain direct access to the products that we
distribute, these customers may reduce the amount of business they transact with us, or cease doing
business with us entirely, which could adversely affect our operating results. In particular, certain larger

31


-----

retail brokerage firms periodically evaluate and establish a list of wholesale insurance brokers with
which they conduct business. If we lose the ability to place business for these firms, our operating
results could be adversely affected.

**_We rely on third parties to provide services, and their failure to perform these services could_**
**_damage our business._**

We rely on a number of third-party service providers. These providers include, but are not limited
to, insurance carriers, payroll service providers responsible for transferring funds to employees, and
providers of data and information such as software vendors and physical and cloud storage providers.
These service providers are located in both the United States and foreign countries. We do not fully
control the actions of these third parties, and we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions or
inactions may adversely impact us. Replacing these service providers could create significant delays in
our operations and increase our operating expenses. Moreover, failure by a service provider to comply
with service-level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, or to otherwise perform in a highquality and timely manner, particularly during periods of peak demand, could cause us to be unable to
deliver our services to our customers, result in contractual or regulatory penalties, generate liability
claims by carriers, customers or employees, and damage our reputation and business. Moreover,
these third parties face their own technology, operating, business and economic risks, and any
significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client,
employee or company information, could cause harm to our business and reputation.

**_An increase in the cost of employee benefits would negatively impact our results of operations_**
**_and cash flows._**

The cost of providing employee benefits, including medical and related benefits, affects our
profitability. In recent years, we have experienced increases in these costs as a result of factors
affecting the economy generally. Although we seek to control these expenses, we can make no
assurance we will be able to limit future cost increases. An increase in the cost of providing employee
benefits would reduce our profitability and cash flows. Conversely, while certain cost-control measures,
such as changes to the amount of the employer-funded portion of employee benefits, may reduce
costs, they may also inhibit our ability to attract, retain or hire additional employees.

**_If any of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the U.S. Federal Deposit_**
**_Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), we could lose the cash, investments and premium trust funds_**
**_on deposit._**

As an insurance broker, we collect premiums paid by clients and hold such cash, net of our
earned commissions and other deductions, in trust, based on local regulatory requirements, until we
remit the cash to the applicable insurance carriers that provide coverage to our clients. Operating and
trust cash balances are concentrated in U.S. financial institutions and are generally invested in money
market accounts, depository accounts or federal securities, and in some cases, are significantly in
excess of FDIC limits.

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other financial institutions in the first half of 2023 has
created uncertainty about the safety of depository accounts with banking institutions and in some
cases has prompted depositors to withdraw their deposits, which has threatened the solvency of
certain financial institutions. If any of the depository institutions that we or our investment managers
have depository accounts fails or is taken over by the FDIC, our ability to access these accounts may
be temporarily or permanently limited, which could result in a material liquidity problem for us and
potentially a material financial loss. Additionally, if our access to operating and trust cash balances is
temporarily or permanently limited, we may experience a material adverse impact on our business,

32


-----

including potential disciplinary action, criminal penalties, fines, damage to our reputation and financial
harm resulting from our failure to satisfy fiduciary regulatory requirements with respect to trust cash
balances.

**_There can be no assurance that our internal controls will be successful in preventing errors or_**
**_fraud in our financial reporting or adequately assist our management in overseeing our_**
**_financial reporting obligations._**

We are not a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and we are not
required to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Moreover, we do not intend to comply on a voluntary basis with these
requirements. Although we have developed and continue to refine a system of internal controls to
support our financial reporting obligations, the effectiveness of these internal controls may vary over
time based on many factors, including:

   - difficulties encountered in the process of integrating businesses we acquire and their personnel
to our financial reporting system, including the need to maintain multiple financial reporting
systems for a period of time following an acquisition;

   - changes affecting the infrastructure, including the information technology systems, we employ
in our business;

   - risks associated with maintaining a decentralized firm, including a failure by an office to report
accurate financial information or to make management aware of developments affecting our
business; and

   - challenges presented by our growth, including the demands placed upon our management.

Moreover, our internal controls have inherent limitations no matter how well designed they are at
any given time. Any failure in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material and
adverse effect on our financial reporting, which could negatively impair our ability (or perceived ability)
to operate our business and deliver accurate and timely financial information.

**_We are required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our_**
**_financial statements. Changes to these judgments, estimates and assumptions could_**
**_negatively affect our financial position or results of operations._**

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make a number of judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses, including those relating to our provision for policy cancellations, the valuation of derivative
financial instruments and related hedge designation, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible
assets, the valuation of asset impairment, depreciation, amortization, loss reserves related to
rent-a-captive arrangements, income taxes, the valuation of earn-out obligations and the valuation and
recognition of equity-based compensation. Although we periodically evaluate the reasonableness of
these judgments, estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ from the amounts reflected in
our financial statements.

**_We are required periodically to perform an impairment analysis of the balance of our goodwill_**
**_and intangible assets, and our assets and results of operations may be negatively affected if we_**
**_are required to write down the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets._**

As of September 30, 2023, we had $1.6 billion of goodwill and $695.7 million of other intangible
assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. We are required periodically to evaluate whether
our goodwill and intangible assets have been impaired or there is a change in circumstances indicating

33


-----

that the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable from estimated
future cash flows. If we determine that we are required to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill or
intangible assets, the charge could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and
operating results.

**_Adverse changes in the U.S. credit markets may materially and adversely affect our business._**

From time to time, we access the U.S. credit markets to increase or refinance our existing credit
facilities in connection with acquisitions, liquidity events and other corporate transactions. A change in
the U.S. credit markets that makes debt financing unavailable, more restrictive or more expensive
would negatively affect our business and could impair our ability to consummate significant
acquisitions. In recent months, global economic conditions, price inflation, measures taken by the U.S.
Federal Reserve to control price inflation and other factors have had a negative impact on U.S. credit
markets generally and have increased prevailing interest rates. We currently are unable to determine
the duration or severity of these factors on U.S. credit markets.

**_Infringement, misappropriation or dilution of our intellectual property could harm our business._**

We believe our trademarks have significant value and that this and other intellectual property are
valuable assets that are important to our success. Unauthorized uses or other infringement of our
trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brand and may adversely affect our
business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every market. Failure to
adequately protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brand and impair our ability to
compete effectively. Defending or enforcing our trademark rights, branding practices and other
intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources and divert the attention of
management, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results,
even if such defense or enforcement is ultimately successful.

**_Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the_**
**_intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively,_**
**_and financial condition._**

To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright
laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our
affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners and others, as well as internal policies and procedures
regarding our management of intellectual property. However, the protective steps that we take may be
inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to
detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
Further, we operate in many foreign jurisdictions and effective trademark, copyright and trade secret
protection may not be available in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services.
Additionally, our competitors and others may have, or may develop, products similar to our products
that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights or may allege that our intellectual
property infringes upon their intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property
adequately, or to successfully defend against claims that our intellectual property infringes upon the
rights of others, could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.

**Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

**_We are subject to claims and litigation, including errors and omissions claims, which can be_**
**_costly to defend and could negatively affect our business._**

We are subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business resulting from alleged
and actual errors and omissions. These types of litigation matters can involve claims for substantial

34


-----

amounts of money for direct and consequential damages and significant defense costs. For example,
we may be subject to errors and omissions claims if we fail (or are alleged to have failed) to provide an
insurance carrier with complete and accurate information relating to the risk being insured, to request
or secure coverage for a particular type of risk, for the requested amounts or on the requested terms,
to act in accordance with the terms of, or to have committed errors or omissions in connection with, our
MGU or binding authority programs, or to comply with state law and other requirements typically
applicable to insurance policies issued by non-admitted insurance carriers in the E&S lines market. We
also are subject to claims that we mishandled the payment of premiums, the adjudication of claims or
other administrative functions in our administration business. We are unable to predict with certainty
the frequency, nature or magnitude of these claims. It is not always possible to prevent or detect errors
and omissions, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases.

We have purchased errors and omissions insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to
protect us, subject to deductible amounts, policy exclusions and other conditions, against the risk of
significant liability resulting from alleged and actual errors and omissions. However, our insurance may
not adequately protect us against every errors and omissions claim. Moreover, we may not be able to
purchase coverage that is appropriate in relation to our assessment of the risks involved on
commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Our business and operating results may be negatively affected if our errors and omissions
insurance is inadequate or unavailable. In addition, errors and omissions claims may harm our
reputation and divert management resources away from operating our business.

**_Our business is subject to laws and regulations applicable to our industry, and compliance with_**
**_these laws and regulations could increase our expenses, restrict our growth and limit our_**
**_ability to conduct our business._**

Our businesses are subject to federal and state governmental regulation and supervision, which
could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance,
restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell them, or subjecting our
businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings.

In the United States, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers,
MGU’s and third-party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds
held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage, MGU and third-party
administration services in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our ability to
maintain all required licenses and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations promulgated from
time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. In addition, most states require
that our employees who engage in brokerage activities in that state be licensed personally. Failure to
maintain the necessary licenses or to comply with the various insurance rules and regulations would
have an adverse effect on our operating results, particularly if it affected any of our significant
businesses.

We also are required in many states to report, collect and remit surplus lines taxes to state taxing
authorities for insurance policies placed in the E&S lines market. The laws and regulations regarding
the calculation of surplus lines taxes vary significantly from state to state, and it can be difficult and
time consuming to determine the amount of surplus lines taxes due to a particular state, especially for
insurance policies covering risks located in more than one state. From time to time, we and our
licensed employees are subject to inspection by state governmental authorities with regard to our
compliance with state insurance laws and regulations and the collection of surplus lines taxes.

We also are affected by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance carriers. For
example, when we act as an MGU for an insurance carrier, we may be required to comply with laws

35


-----

and regulations affecting the insurance carrier. Moreover, governmental regulation of insurance
carriers with which we do business can affect how we conduct operations.

State laws grant supervisory agencies, including state insurance departments, broad regulatory
authority. State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, some of which affect us. These supervisory
agencies regulate, among other things, the licensing of insurance brokers and third-party
administrators, the handling and investment of third-party funds held in a fiduciary capacity and the
marketing practices of insurance brokers, in the context of curbing unfair trade practices. This continual
reexamination may result in the enactment of laws and regulations, or the issuance of interpretations of
existing laws and regulations, that adversely affect our business. More restrictive laws, rules or
regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult and expensive or
adversely affect our business. Violations of applicable federal or state laws or regulations could result
in the imposition of fines or censures, disciplinary actions, including the revocation of licenses or
registrations, damage to our reputation, or a limitation on our business. Moreover, the costs of
complying with these regulations may increase our operating expenses.

Changes in the regulatory scheme, or changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could
have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing our cost
of complying with these regulations. Likewise, increased government involvement in the insurance or
reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

In addition, new regulatory developments could increase competition and adversely affect us.
These developments include:

   - changes in our business model as a result of regulatory actions or changes;

   - the establishment of state-sponsored programs that provide property insurance in catastrophe
prone areas or other alternative types of coverage; and

   - changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans.

**_We are also subject to a wide range of laws and governmental regulations applicable to all_**
**_businesses, and the costs of compliance with such regulations could reduce our profitability,_**
**_limit our growth or increase competition._**

We are subject to legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including by U.S. state
regulators, under the U.K. Companies Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of
2010, and a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, data
privacy and protection, anti-money laundering, wage and hour standards, employment and labor
relations, anti-competition and anti-corruption. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our
profitability or limit our growth by:

   - increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance;

   - limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the
methods by which we sell our products and services, the prices we can charge for our services,
or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, insurance carriers and third
parties; or

   - subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions or proceedings.

There have been efforts in recent years to regulate data privacy and the use and protection of
personal information. In the United States, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act,
which significantly enhances privacy requirements and the protection and use of personal information.
Other states have enacted, introduced or considered similar legislation.

36


-----

In the United Kingdom and the European Union, new laws and regulations have imposed new
data privacy compliance obligations and significant penalties for noncompliance. Other jurisdictions
internationally have sought to adopt similar and in some cases more expansive data protection laws
and regulations. It can often be difficult to evaluate the scope of these laws and regulations, their
applicability to our business, and the measures necessary to comply and monitor compliance with
these laws and regulations, which in some cases are inconsistent with similar laws and regulations in
other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations can result in significant additional compliance costs,
divert management time from other projects and restrict the way we do business and use and store
data, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations. Further, in the event that we are found
to be out of compliance with any applicable state, federal and/or foreign laws and regulations, we could
potentially be subject to civil or criminal sanctions, damage to our reputation, and other costs and
impacts, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

We are also affected by changes in laws and regulations affecting businesses generally, including
changes in tax laws and regulations and developments affecting healthcare for our employees and
parties for which we place group benefit products. It is difficult to anticipate how any new laws or
regulations, or changes to existing requirements or interpretations of laws and regulations, may affect
our business. We continue to evaluate how our business may be affected by legal and regulatory
developments as well as the necessary steps for compliance with new laws and regulations as they
are adopted.

Moreover, the increasingly global nature of our business escalates the complexity of measures
necessary to comply with laws and regulations, including the development of internal systems, policies
and employee training programs that increase the cost of doing business. Internationally, many laws
and regulations may have conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, further increasing the
complexity, cost and risk of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less
developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not provide clear and reliable guidance to
provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary actions required to operate our
business effectively and profitably.

**_Our international operations are subject to foreign governmental regulation specific to our_**
**_industry and supervision and compliance with such requirements may increase costs, restrict_**
**_our international growth and adversely affect our ability to compete._**

Our international operations are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things,
licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment. These
various regulations add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance, training and
employee expenses. In the United Kingdom, our Lloyd’s brokerage operations are required to be
licensed and are subject to regulation and periodic examination by the U.K. Financial Conduct
Authority, or FCA. Our operations in certain other foreign countries—including Bermuda, where we are
subject to regulation by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, or BMA, and the Cayman Islands, where we
are subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, or CIMA—are similarly subject to
licensing and regulatory oversight by the respective local insurance regulator located in these
countries. Generally, such authorities are vested with broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke
licenses and approvals, to implement regulations, to inspect and regulate the affected businesses, and
in some cases to approve investments in us by third parties. Accordingly, we may be precluded or
temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities, fined or otherwise penalized in a
given jurisdiction and required to comply with certain restrictions on the operations of our business,
including restrictions requiring us to maintain cash reserves in our foreign businesses, or precluded
from engaging in certain corporate transactions that we desire to pursue.

37


-----

**_Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the_**
**_insurance industry._**

In the past, state regulators have scrutinized the manner in which insurance brokers are
compensated. For example, the Attorney General of the State of New York has in the past investigated
and, in certain cases, brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community for
anti-competitive practices. These actions have created uncertainty concerning long-standing methods
of compensating insurance brokers. Given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny
from regulators in the past over its compensation practices, and the transparency and disclosure to
clients regarding these compensation practices, it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the
same or other practices in the future. If they do so, compliance with new regulations along with any
sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on
our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business.

**Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes**

**_Our substantial leverage and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our_**
**_financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business._**

We have, and after the completion of this offering will continue to have, a significant amount of
indebtedness, and we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, subject to
certain conditions. As of September 30, 2023, after giving effect to the issuance of the Senior Secured
Notes offered hereby, we would have had $4.9 billion of indebtedness outstanding, $4.1 billion of which
would have been secured indebtedness. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, $298.0 million would
have been available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility (after giving effect to undrawn
letters of credit having an aggregate face amount of $2.0 million). Our financial performance could be
adversely affected by our substantial leverage.

This high level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including, but
not limited to:

   - we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to outstanding debt obligations;

   - we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions, capital
expenditures or other purposes;

   - we may need to use all, or a substantial portion, of our available excess cash flows to pay
interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance
our operations and other business activities, including, but not limited to, working capital
requirements, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other general corporate or business
activities;

   - our debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry
conditions;

   - some of our debt has variable rates of interest and, to the extent such debt is not swapped at a
fixed rate, we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates;

   - our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business
and in our industry in general;

   - our substantial amount of debt and the amount we must pay to service our debt obligations
could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

   - we may have increased borrowing costs;

   - our clients or insurance carriers may react adversely to our significant debt level;

38


-----

   - we may have insufficient funds, and our debt level may also restrict us from raising the funds
necessary, to retire certain of our debt instruments tendered to us upon the occurrence of a
change of control, which would constitute an event of default under certain of our debt
instruments; and

   - our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments
which, among other things, require us to maintain specified financial ratios and limit our ability
to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived,
could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.

Our high level of indebtedness requires that we use a substantial portion of our cash flows from
operations to pay principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of
cash to fund working capital requirements, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other general corporate
or business activities.

In addition, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, including
borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities. If market interest rates increase, debt service on
our variable-rate debt will rise, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and
financial position. Although we have employed hedging strategies such that a portion of the aggregate
principal amount of our term loans carries a fixed rate of interest, any hedging arrangement put in
place may not offer complete protection from this risk. Additionally, the remaining portion of borrowings
under our senior secured credit facilities that are not hedged will be subject to changes in interest
rates.

**_We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and meet_**
**_our other ongoing liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under our indebtedness, which may be unsuccessful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our
planned acquisitions, capital expenditures and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial
and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to
certain financial, business, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We
cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
borrowings will be available to us under our existing debt instruments or otherwise in an amount
sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness or to fund
our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
We may be unable to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if
successful, such refinancing may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity
and Capital Resources” for a general discussion of our cash flows and liquidity.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we
may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or acquisitions, seek additional capital or seek to
restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may be unsuccessful and may
not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results
and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material
assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The restrictive
covenants included in the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes, the indenture that
governs our 4.875% Senior Notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit
facilities restrict our ability to use the proceeds from certain asset sales. We may be unable to
consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and the
proceeds that we do receive may be inadequate to meet any debt service obligations when due.

39


-----

If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default under our debt
instruments, including the Senior Secured Notes, and holders of such debt could declare all
outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our senior secured credit
facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the
assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Upon any such
bankruptcy filing, we would be stayed from making any ongoing payments on the Senior Secured
Notes, and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition
interest or applicable fees, costs or charges, or any “adequate protection” under Title 11 of the United
States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). Furthermore, if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced under
the Bankruptcy Code, we could be subject to claims, with respect to any payments made within 90
days prior to commencement of such a case, that we were insolvent at the time any such payments
were made and that all or a portion of such payments, which could include repayments of amounts due
under the Senior Secured Notes, might be deemed to constitute a preference, under the Bankruptcy
Code, and that such payments should be voided by the bankruptcy court and recovered from the
recipients for the benefit of the entire bankruptcy estate. Also, in the event that we were to become a
debtor in a bankruptcy case seeking reorganization or other relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a delay
or substantial reduction in payments under the Senior Secured Notes may otherwise occur. All of these
events could result in your losing your investment in the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of
Certain Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Senior Secured Notes.”

**_Despite our current leverage, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial_**
**_additional debt. This could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future,
including additional secured debt. Although the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit
facilities, the indenture that governs our 4.875% Senior Notes and the Indenture that will govern the
Senior Secured Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these
restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness
incurred in compliance with these restrictions or following a waiver of these restrictions could be
substantial. If we incur any additional secured indebtedness, the holders of that debt will be entitled to
receive before you any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation,
reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of us to the extent of the value of the collateral securing
the outstanding obligations under such additional indebtedness. This may have the effect of reducing
the amount of proceeds paid to you. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring
obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, $298.0 million
would have been available for borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility (after giving
effect to undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face amount of $2.0 million). If new debt is
added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify.

**_Certain of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive_**
**_covenants which will limit our ability to finance future operations, acquisitions or capital needs_**
**_or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest._**

The operating and financial covenants and restrictions in (i) the credit agreement that governs our
senior secured credit facilities (ii) the indenture that governs our 4.875% Senior Notes and (iii) in the
Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes impose, and the terms of any future indebtedness
may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictions affect or will
affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability and the ability of certain of
our subsidiaries to:

   - incur additional indebtedness;

   - create liens;

40


-----

   - pay dividends and make other distributions in respect of our equity securities;

   - redeem our equity securities;

   - make certain investments or certain other restricted payments;

   - sell certain kinds of assets;

   - enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and

   - effect mergers or consolidations.

In addition, as discussed under “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness,” our senior secured
credit facilities also require us to comply with a secured leverage ratio under specified circumstances.
Our ability to comply with this ratio may be affected by events beyond our control.

The restrictions contained in our debt instruments could (1) limit our ability to plan for or react to
market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business
plans and (2) adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, acquisitions, investments or
strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our
interest.

A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios
could result in a default under all or certain of our debt instruments. If an event of default occurs, our
applicable creditors could elect to:

   - declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be
immediately due and payable;

   - require us to apply all of our available cash to repay the borrowings; or

   - prevent us from making debt service payments on certain of our borrowings.

If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings when due, the applicable
creditors could sell the collateral securing certain of our debt instruments, which constitutes
substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries’ assets.

**_We operate primarily as a holding company, and we depend on cash from our subsidiaries to_**
**_service our debt. If we do not receive cash distributions, dividends or other payments from our_**
**_subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required debt service payments._**

We operate primarily as a holding company, and substantially all of our operations are conducted
through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, we are dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of, and
cash distributions, dividends and other payments from, our subsidiaries, including our foreign
subsidiaries, to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations. If we do not receive
such cash distributions, dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal or interest payments on our outstanding debt. Unless they are Guarantors of the
Senior Secured Notes or our other indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay
amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes or our other indebtedness, as the case may be, or to make
funds available for that purpose.

Generally, the ability of a subsidiary to make cash available to its parent is affected by its own
operating results and is subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in security
instruments, both equity and debt, and other agreements. Although certain of our debt instruments limit
the extent to which our subsidiaries may enter into agreements that limit their ability to make dividend
and other payments to us, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions.

41


-----

Moreover, there may be restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us under applicable laws,
including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments
to their owners only from profits. As a result, although our subsidiaries may have cash, we or our
subsidiaries may be unable to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligations.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt_**
**_service obligations to increase significantly._**

Borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose
us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate
indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income
and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.
Based on our outstanding debt balances at September 30, 2023, an immediate hypothetical change of
10% in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately $8.6 million on an
annual basis, net of the effect of our interest rate swap agreements. We may, from time to time, enter
into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to
reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of
our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk
and could be subject to credit risk themselves.

**_The Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities_**
**_of any current and future non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

The Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all
indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.
The Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes will allow the non-guarantor subsidiaries to
incur certain additional indebtedness in the future and will not limit the incurrence of liabilities that do
not constitute indebtedness. Any right that we or the Guarantors have to receive any assets of any
non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the
consequent rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of
those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those non-guarantor
subsidiaries’ creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those
subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries, holders of their debt, including their trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding indebtedness or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, are generally entitled to payment on
their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to
us. Our subsidiaries that do not and will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes represented 8.7%
and 6.6% of our total Pro Forma Adjusted Revenues and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, respectively,
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, these non-guarantor subsidiaries
represented 12.0% and 8.7% of our consolidated assets and liabilities (excluding intercompany assets
and liabilities), respectively, as of September 30, 2023.

**_We may not be able to purchase the Senior Secured Notes upon a change of control, which_**
**_would result in a default under the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes and_**
**_would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition._**

Upon a “change of control” as defined under “Description of Senior Secured Notes,” we are
required to make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding at 101% of
their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date unless the
Senior Secured Notes have been previously called for redemption. The indenture governing our
4.875% Senior Notes contains similar provisions. Additionally, under our senior secured credit facilities,
a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to

42


-----

accelerate the maturity of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and terminate their
commitments to lend. Our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. The source of funds
for any purchase of the Senior Secured Notes and the 4.875% Senior Notes and repayment of
borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities would be our available cash or cash generated
from other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by our
existing or new owners. We may not be able to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon a change
of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities
that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. In
particular, if the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities becomes due and is not paid,
the lenders thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral that secures such
indebtedness, thereby limiting our ability to raise cash to purchase the Senior Secured Notes and
reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes. If we fail to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes in that circumstance, we will be in default
under the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes. We may require additional financing
from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on
satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes may be limited
by law.

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and guarantees_**
**_and require holders of the Senior Secured Notes to return payments received, and if that_**
**_occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Senior Secured Notes._**

Our creditors and the creditors of the Guarantors of the Senior Secured Notes could challenge
the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantors’ issuance of their guarantees,
respectively, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. Under U.S. bankruptcy law
and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a court could void the issuance of the
Senior Secured Notes or a guarantee or claims related to the Senior Secured Notes or subordinate a
guarantee to all of our other debts or to all other debts of a Guarantor if, among other things, we or a
Guarantor, at the time we or such Guarantor incurred the indebtedness or issued a guarantee:

   - intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the delivery of the
Senior Secured Notes or the guarantee, as the case may be, and if we or the Guarantor:

      - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

      - was engaged in a business or transaction for which our or the Guarantor’s remaining assets
constituted unreasonably small capital; or

      - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as
they mature (as all of the foregoing terms are defined or interpreted under the relevant
fraudulent transfer or conveyance statutes).

In addition, a court could void any payment by us or a Guarantor pursuant to the Senior Secured
Notes or a guarantee and require that payment be returned to us or such Guarantor or to a fund for the
benefit of our creditors or the creditors of the Guarantor. If the Senior Secured Notes or guarantees
were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against us or
the Guarantors for amounts payable on the Senior Secured Notes would be unenforceable to the
extent of such avoidance or limitation. Even if the guarantee of a Guarantor is not avoided as a
fraudulent transfer, a court may subordinate the guarantee to that Guarantor’s other debt. In that event,
the guarantees would be structurally subordinated to all of the Guarantor’s other debt. Moreover, the
court could order you to return any payments previously made by us or the Guarantors.

43


-----

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the
governing law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred.
Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of
all of its assets;

   - the present fair saleable value of all of its assets was less than the amount that would be
required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they
become absolute and mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot be certain what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or,
regardless of the standard, that a court would not void the Senior Secured Notes or the guarantees
thereof.

The Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes will contain a “savings clause,” which is
intended to limit the liability of each Guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such
Guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer.
We cannot assure you that this limitation will protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer
challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would
suffice, if necessary, to pay the Senior Secured Notes in full when due. Furthermore, in the case
_Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc. v. Citicorp North America, Inc., the U.S._
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings
clause used in the Indenture was unenforceable. As a result, the subsidiary guarantees were found to
be fraudulent conveyances. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the
liability findings of the Bankruptcy Court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses
generally. If the TOUSA decision is followed by other courts, the risk that the guarantees would be
deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased.

We believe that, after giving effect to this offering, we will not be insolvent, will not have
unreasonably small capital for our business and will not have incurred debts beyond our ability to pay
such debts as they mature. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply
in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not_**
**_intend to register the Senior Secured Notes under applicable securities laws. There are_**
**_restrictions on your ability to transfer and resell the Senior Secured Notes without registration_**
**_under applicable securities laws._**

The Senior Secured Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration
under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and we do not intend to register the
Senior Secured Notes under applicable securities laws. The holders of the Senior Secured Notes will
not be entitled to require us to register the Senior Secured Notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore,
you may transfer or resell the Senior Secured Notes in the United States only in a transaction
registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable
state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite
period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

44


-----

**_Your ability to transfer the Senior Secured Notes may be limited by the absence of an active_**
**_trading market, and an active trading market may not develop or, if developed, be maintained_**
**_for the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be a new class of securities for which there is no established
trading market. We expect the Senior Secured Notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional
buyers,” as defined under Rule 144A, but we do not intend to list the Senior Secured Notes on any
national securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system.
Although the Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Senior
Secured Notes, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so, and may discontinue market making
activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for the Senior Secured Notes may not
develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the Senior
Secured Notes. In such case, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not be able to sell their
notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. If a trading market were to develop, future trading
prices of the Senior Secured Notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

   - the number of holders of Senior Secured Notes;

   - our operating performance and financial condition;

   - the market for similar securities;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the Senior Secured Notes; and

   - prevailing interest rates.

Even if an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes does develop, there is no
guarantee that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject
to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Senior
Secured Notes. The market, if any, for the Senior Secured Notes may experience similar disruptions
and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you
may sell your Senior Secured Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Senior
Secured Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending upon prevailing
interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**_A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes, if any, could cause the liquidity or market value of the Senior Secured Notes to_**
**_decline._**

The Senior Secured Notes are expected to be rated by rating agencies. A rating is not a
recommendation to purchase, sell or hold the Senior Secured Notes. We cannot assure you that any
rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of
the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any lowering or withdrawal of a rating
by a rating agency could reduce the liquidity or market value of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Any credit ratings assigned to the Senior Secured Notes may not reflect all risks of an_**
**_investment in the Senior Secured Notes, and any lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned_**
**_to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce_**
**_our access to capital._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including
Amwins. We cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain our corporate rating, or their initial
ratings on the debt, including the Senior Secured Notes. Our debt currently has a non-investment
grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in

45


-----

that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse
changes, so warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally
affect the market value of the Senior Secured Notes. Credit ratings are not recommendations to
purchase, hold or sell the Senior Secured Notes. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the
potential effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the Senior Secured Notes.

Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to
obtain additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to the Senior Secured Notes is
subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your Senior Secured
Notes without a substantial discount.

**_Certain of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply during any period in which the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes have Investment Grade Ratings._**

Certain of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us during any period in which the
Senior Secured Notes have Investment Grade Ratings (as defined in the Indenture), provided at such
time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Such covenants restrict, among
other things, our ability to pay distributions, incur debt and enter into certain other transactions. There
can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever have Investment Grade Ratings, or that if
they have Investment Grade Ratings, that the Senior Secured Notes will maintain these ratings.
However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would
not be permitted while these covenants were in force. To the extent the covenants are subsequently
reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of
default under the Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Senior Secured
Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**Risks Related to the Collateral**

**_The rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes may be adversely affected by the Equal_**
**_Priority Intercreditor Agreement._**

The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will set forth the relative rights of, and relationship
among, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Collateral Agent and the lenders under our senior secured credit
facilities and the applicable representative of the holders and the holders under any other future parity
lien indebtedness in respect of the exercise of rights and remedies against us and the Guarantors.

Under the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, as discussed below, the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Collateral Agent has the exclusive right (subject to limited exceptions) to
exercise remedies and take enforcement actions relating to the Collateral, acting at the direction of the
lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities until the satisfaction in full of the obligations
thereunder. Thereafter, the representative of holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount
of parity lien indebtedness will have the right to exercise rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral. As such, if other parity lien indebtedness is outstanding in an aggregate principal amount
greater than the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes at such time,
such other parity lien indebtedness may be able to direct the applicable representative with respect to
matters related to the Collateral (including the commencement and continuation of enforcement
proceedings with respect to the Collateral, controlling the conduct of such proceedings and, in
connection therewith, approving releases of the Collateral) without consent from the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes. In connection with the exercise of the rights and remedies against the
Collateral, any release by the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities of the Collateral (other
than a termination of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or a release of all the Collateral) will also

46


-----

release the liens securing the Senior Secured Notes on the same Collateral without any further action
by the Trustee, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.
If the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Collateral Agent forecloses and sells the pledged equity interests
in any subsidiary Guarantor, then that Guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the Senior
Secured Notes and any liens granted by such Guarantor for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes
will be released automatically and immediately upon such sale.

Under these circumstances, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes, with limited exceptions, will not have the ability to control or direct these
actions, even if the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes are adversely affected, and may
not be able to act quickly, or at all, to have the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent realize on the
Collateral. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Security—Equal Priority Intercreditor
Arrangement.”

**_The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes and our other obligations secured by a lien on the Collateral._**

The Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees thereof will be secured, subject to certain
limitations and exceptions and permitted liens, by a first-priority lien on the Collateral. Accordingly, any
proceeds received upon a realization of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and our
Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be applied to the costs and expenses incurred in connection with
such realization and, ratably, to obligations (including expenses and other amounts) under the Senior
Secured Notes and our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other future parity lien indebtedness.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and the
fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others,
general economic conditions and similar factors. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied
upon as a measure of realizable value for such assets. The amount to be received upon a sale of the
Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market
value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers.
By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid or intangible and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding,
the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or
liquidation of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes, in full or at all. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period
of time (or at all) in an orderly manner.

To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties, including junior liens,
encumber assets located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and
remedies with respect to the property subject to such encumbrances that could adversely affect the
value of the Collateral and the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. In particular, the
Indenture will permit certain liens, including liens on excluded assets and liens in favor of third parties
to, among other things, secure purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and any
assets subject to such liens may be automatically excluded from the Collateral where the agreement
governing such indebtedness or obligation prohibits the grant of a lien on such assets to the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral Agent.

Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the
Senior Secured Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of
the Senior Secured Notes from the sale of the Collateral and any unpaid obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other indebtedness secured by pari passu (or

47


-----

senior) liens will rank equally in right of payment with any claim of all of our other senior unsecured,
unsubordinated indebtedness, including trade payables, against our and, as applicable, the
Guarantors’ remaining assets.

In addition, the Indenture will permit us to incur additional indebtedness secured by a lien on the
Collateral that ranks on a pari passu basis with the liens securing the Senior Secured Notes. Your
rights to the Collateral would be diluted by an increase in the additional indebtedness secured by pari
_passu liens on the Collateral. Certain other creditors may have liens (including statutory liens), whether_
or not permitted by the Indenture, which rank prior to the liens of the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes on the Collateral. Any such liens may further limit the recovery from the realization of the value
of the Collateral available to satisfy holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the_**
**_Collateral and in certain cases will cause the asset on which such liens are imposed to be_**
**_excluded from the Collateral. There are also certain other categories of property that are_**
**_similarly excluded from the Collateral._**

The Collateral may be subject to liens permitted under the terms of the Indenture. The existence
of any permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral that could be realized
by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes as well as the ability of the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. In addition, the imposition of certain permitted
liens may cause the relevant assets to become “Excluded Assets” (as defined in “Description of Senior
Secured Notes”) which will not secure the Senior Secured Notes or the related guarantees.

In addition, the Indenture will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure purchase money
indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and any assets subject to such liens may be automatically
excluded from the Collateral where the contract or other agreement in which such lien is granted
prohibits the grant of a lien on such assets to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent or such grant
shall constitute or result in a breach or would give the other party thereto the right to terminate such
contract or agreement. Our ability to incur purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations
is subject to limitations, as described in “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”
Other categories of Excluded Assets under the Indenture include leased real property, certain
contracts, letter of credit rights below a threshold and equity and assets of unrestricted subsidiaries.
See “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Security—Collateral.” Excluded Assets will not be available
as Collateral to secure our and the guarantors’ obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. As a
result, with respect to the Excluded Assets, the Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees will
effectively rank equally with any of our other unsubordinated indebtedness and, as applicable, the
Guarantors which is not secured by the Excluded Assets.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the Collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the Collateral will reveal any or all existing liens
on such Collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be significant, could be
prior in ranking to the liens securing the Senior Secured Notes and guarantees thereof and could have
an adverse effect on the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose
upon the Collateral and the guarantees thereof.

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure._**

Our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are secured only by the Collateral described in
this offering circular. The ability of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose on the

48


-----

Collateral on your behalf may be subject to perfection, priority issues, state or foreign law requirements
and practical problems associated with the realization of the security interest or lien in the Collateral of
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent, including cure rights, foreclosing on the Collateral within
the time periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making
additional filings, statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. We cannot
assure you that the consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities will be given
when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure you that
foreclosure on the Collateral will be sufficient to make all payments on the Senior Secured Notes.

The holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Trustee also may be limited in their ability to
enforce a breach of the lien covenant that will be set forth in the indenture governing the Senior
Secured Notes and is described under “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—
Liens.” Some decisions of state courts have placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate debt
secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens or
leasehold estates, and a lender may need to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to
protect against impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default.
Although the foregoing court decisions may have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal
laws, the scope of such preemption, if any, is uncertain. Accordingly, a court could prevent the trustee
and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes from declaring a default and accelerating the Senior
Secured Notes by reason of a breach of such covenant, which could have a material adverse effect on
the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to enforce the covenant.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not control certain decisions regarding Collateral._**

Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Agreement, the Indenture and the related security
documents will generally allow us and our subsidiaries to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over and freely operate the Collateral and collect, invest and dispose of any income from
the Collateral. This may impact the type and quality of the security interest granted in respect of
the Collateral. For example, so long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would
result therefrom, we may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent under the Indenture, Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement or the related security documents, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to
the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and
making ordinary course cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). In addition, to the
extent we sell any assets that constitute Collateral, the proceeds from such sale will be subject to
a lien securing the Senior Secured Notes only to the extent such proceeds would otherwise
constitute “Collateral” securing the Senior Secured Notes under the related security documents.
To the extent the proceeds from any sale of Collateral do not constitute “Collateral” under the
applicable security documents, the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes would be
reduced. Moreover, the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to make decisions regarding
Collateral is limited by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. See “—The rights of holders of
the Senior Secured Notes may be adversely affected by the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement.”

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment in full, discharge or defeasance of the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes under which the Collateral could be automatically released without_**
**_consent of the Trustee, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent or the holders of the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes._**

Under various circumstances, all or a portion of the Collateral may be released, including:

   - to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral (to a person that is not us or a
Guarantor) in a transaction not prohibited under the Indenture;

49


-----

   - the Collateral becoming an Excluded Asset;

   - with respect to Collateral held by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its
guarantee; or

   - pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

The guarantee of any subsidiary Guarantor will be released in connection with a sale of such
subsidiary Guarantor, or issuance of the equity interests of such subsidiary Guarantor, in a transaction
not prohibited by the Indenture and it should be noted that the Indenture will not prohibit the sale,
transfer or issuance of any equity interests of a subsidiary Guarantor or other restricted subsidiary to
third parties or other persons. The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of our
restricted subsidiaries that is a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a subsidiary
Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, all of the liens in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes on any Collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the
Senior Secured Notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the
Indenture. Designation as an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral to
the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In
addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the
assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
will have no claim to such assets. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Security—Collateral—
Release of Collateral,” “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Additional Secured Note Guarantees,”
“Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and
“Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary.”

**_Bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to_**
**_realize value from the Collateral._**

The right of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral
upon the occurrence of an event of default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed)
by bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate arrangement, winding-up or similar law if bankruptcy, insolvency,
corporate arrangement, winding-up or similar proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or
possibly even after the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent has repossessed and disposed of the
Collateral. Under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral Agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or
from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor or any other collateral, without prior bankruptcy
court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law
permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or
profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments,
provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate
protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the
secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional
or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution
in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the
collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A U.S. bankruptcy court may
determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for diminution in the value of its
collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the broad discretionary
powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as due to the lack of a precise definition of the term
“adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Senior Secured
Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of any delay in
making such payments), whether or when the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent could repossess
or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or whether

50


-----

or to what extent holders of the Senior Secured Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment
of loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” In addition, the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that so long as any obligations under our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities are outstanding, in the event of a bankruptcy, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will be subject to certain restrictions with respect to their ability to object to various
motions or seek other relief with respect to the Collateral on a number of important matters, and the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes may under certain circumstances be required to turn over
amounts they may receive in respect of the Collateral to the holders of obligations under our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, as applicable. See “—The rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes may
be adversely affected by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.” After such a bankruptcy filing, the
value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may be
unable to raise various objections or take other actions.

As a general matter, under bankruptcy and insolvency law, our or any Guarantor’s liabilities in
respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees may, in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceedings, rank junior to certain other debt that is entitled to priority under the laws of such
jurisdiction. Debt entitled to priority may include (1) amounts owed in respect of employee pension
schemes, (2) certain other amounts owed to employees, (3) amounts owed to governmental agencies,
including tax authorities and (4) expenses of an insolvency practitioner. In addition, in some
jurisdictions, an examiner, monitor, trustee, receiver or administrator or similar party may be legally
required to consider the interests of third parties (including, for example, employees) or the best
interests of the relevant company in connection with the proceedings.

Furthermore, in the event the U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is
not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference or “deficiency.” U.S. bankruptcy laws do
not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees for
“undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of undercollateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate
protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to the unsecured, deficiency portion of the Senior
Secured Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made prior to or at the
time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the U.S.
bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only
be properly perfected and its priority retained through the taking of certain actions. The liens on the
Collateral from time to time owned by us securing obligations under the Senior Secured Notes may not
be perfected if we have not taken the actions necessary to perfect any of those liens. Our inability or
failure to promptly take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests in the
Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection of the security interest for
the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to which they would have been otherwise
entitled. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a
general security interest, such as real property and intellectual property, can only be perfected at the
time such property and rights are acquired and identified and may then be subject to claw back in the
event of bankruptcy of the relevant collateral provider.

The Trustee or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent will not be required to monitor, and we
may not inform the Trustee or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of
property and rights that constitute Collateral, and necessary action may not be taken by us to properly

51


-----

perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or
rights that constitute Collateral or monitor the perfection of or make any filings to perfect or maintain
the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Senior Secured Notes against third parties. Such
failure may result in the loss of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in favor
of the Senior Secured Notes against third parties. Even if the Trustee or the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral Agent does properly perfect liens on Collateral acquired or arising in the future, such liens
may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain
circumstances. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or any guarantee issued in favor of the holders
of Senior Secured Notes might be avoidable in bankruptcy or otherwise.”

Additionally, the Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the offering
of the Senior Secured Notes will not require us to take a number of actions to perfect or to improve the
perfection or priority of the liens of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes, including control agreements with respect to deposit accounts
and securities accounts.

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or any guarantee issued in favor of the holders of Senior_**
**_Secured Notes might be avoidable in bankruptcy or otherwise._**

Any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent, including
pursuant to security documents delivered after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, or any
guarantees issued in the future, might be avoidable (as a preferential transfer, preference, transfer at
undervalue or otherwise) by the pledgor or Guarantor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in
bankruptcy (or potentially by our other creditors) or similar official if certain events or circumstances
exist or occur, including if the pledgor or Guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or guarantee,
the pledge or guarantee permits the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to receive a greater recovery
in any Chapter 7 liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or corporate arrangement or similar
proceeding of the pledgor than if the pledge or guarantee had not been given and such a proceeding in
respect of the pledgor or Guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or issuance of
the guarantee or, in certain circumstances, one year of lien perfection (or potentially one year for any
“insiders”) or any other applicable review period. Thus, in any bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or
corporate arrangement or similar proceeding commenced within 90 days or any other applicable
review period after lien perfection (or potentially one year for any “insiders”) or the issuance of a
guarantee, a lien given to secure, or a guarantee given to guarantee, previously existing indebtedness
is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference, transfer at undervalue or otherwise by the
applicable court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the completion date (or within any
applicable 30-day statutory safe harbor).

Accordingly, if we or any Guarantor were to file for bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or
corporate arrangement or similar law after the Issue Date and a lien granted after such date had been
perfected, or a guarantee issued, less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy
proceeding (or any other applicable review period), such liens securing or guarantees guaranteeing the
Senior Secured Notes may be particularly subject to challenge and avoidance as a result of having
been delivered after the Issue Date. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or a guarantee
is avoided as a preference, transfer at undervalue or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the
security interest or guarantee.

52


-----

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of the Company or any of the Guarantors, the holders of the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in_**
**_respect of the Senior Secured Notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees._**

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to us or any of the Guarantors that have guaranteed
the Senior Secured Notes, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or
competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the Collateral on the date of the bankruptcy
filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and all of our other
outstanding obligations secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral. Upon a finding by the
bankruptcy court that the Senior Secured Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy
proceeding with respect to the Senior Secured Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim
and an unsecured “deficiency” claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of
security in the Collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
would be limited to the value of the Collateral.

The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a
lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to receive post-petition
interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes
to receive “adequate protection” under the Bankruptcy Code, as discussed above. In addition, if any
payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of
the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

**_There are certain categories of assets that are excluded from the Collateral._**

Certain categories of assets are excluded from the Collateral. Excluded Assets include, among
other things: (1) any general intangible, deposit account, securities account, account receivable, lease,
license, contract, property right or agreement to which we or any Guarantor is party or any of its rights
or interests thereunder, in each case, if and for so long as security interests therein (A) shall be
prohibited by any valid and enforceable provision of any contract, agreement, instrument or indenture
governing such general intangible, deposit account, securities account, account receivable, lease,
license contract, property right or agreement, (B) would give any other party to such general intangible,
deposit account, securities account, account receivable, lease, license, contract, property right or
agreement the right to terminate its obligations thereunder, (C) is permitted only with the consent of
another party to such deposit account, securities account, account receivable, lease, license contract,
property right or agreement, if such consent has not been obtained, (D) shall constitute or result in the
abandonment, invalidation or unenforceability of any right, title or interest of any Guarantor therein,
(E) shall constitute or result in a breach or termination (or result in any party thereto having the right to
terminate) pursuant to the terms of, or a default under, any such general intangible, deposit account,
securities account, account receivable, lease, license, contract, property right or agreement, or
(F) shall constitute or result in a violation under any law, regulation, permit, order or decree of any
governmental authority (including any requirement to obtain the consent of any governmental authority
or third party); (2) certain equity interests and certain deposit accounts; (3) “intent-to-use” trademark
applications prior to the filing of “Amendment to Allege Use” or “Statement of Use” filing; (4) all real
property leasehold interests and owned real property interests having a value of $20.0 million or lower;
(5) any assets subject to a lien securing capital lease obligations or purchase money debt obligations,
in each case permitted by the Indenture, if the contract or other agreement in which such lien is
granted prohibits the assignment of such assets, or the creation of any other lien on such assets shall
constitute or result in a breach or would give the other party thereto the right to terminate such contract
or other agreement; (6) any particular asset, if the pledge thereof or the security interest therein would
result in material adverse tax consequences to us or any Guarantor as reasonably determined by us

53


-----

and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral Agent; (7) certain letter-of-credit rights; (8) receivables and
related assets sold, otherwise disposed of or pledged in connection with a receivables financing or
similar transaction permitted by the Indenture; and (9) certain commercial tort claims. See “Description
of Senior Secured Notes—Security—Collateral.” If an event of default occurs and the Senior Secured
Notes are accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees will rank equally with the holders
of other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the relevant entity with respect to such
excluded property.

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We believe we maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate
and customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or
not economically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, we cannot assure you that the insurance
proceeds will compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the
Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us would be sufficient to
satisfy all of satisfy all of our obligations, including the secured obligations owed to the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes and our other parity lien indebtedness. In the event of a total or partial loss to
any of our facilities, certain items of equipment may not be easily replaced.

**_The security interests in the Collateral are not directly granted to the holders of the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure our Obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes and the Obligations of the Guarantors under the related guarantees are not granted directly to
holders of the Senior Secured Notes but are granted only in favor of the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the Indenture
that governs the Senior Secured Notes and the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. The holders of
the Senior Secured Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the collateral, except through the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
Agent.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We intend to use the proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, (i) to pay all related
transaction fees and expenses, which we estimate to be approximately $11.0 million, (ii) to make
restricted payments of approximately $1.05 billion, to the extent permitted by our senior secured credit
facilities, the Indenture and the indenture governing our 4.875% Senior Notes, and (iii) for general
corporate purposes, including funding pending and future acquisitions. The Company intends to
determine the amount of any restricted payments to be made with the proceeds from this offering
based on acquisition opportunities available to it and the funds that would be required to pursue such
opportunities. Such restricted payments may be in the form of a dividend payable to Amwins Holding,
which may use these funds to declare a pro rata distribution payable to its owners, and payments to
certain holders of stock options of Amwins Group and unvested units of Amwins Holding required in
connection with such a dividend.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION**
**AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read_
_together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this_
_offering circular. The results described below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be_
_expected in any future period. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are_
_inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ significantly from those projected_
_in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors and a variety of risks and uncertainties,_
_including those described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and_
_“Risk Factors.” We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement._

**Overview**

We are one of the largest independent wholesale distributors of specialty insurance products in
the world, serving retail insurance brokers by providing P&C products, specialty group benefit products
and administrative services. We support our approximately 34,000 retail broker clients by offering
access to specialty, hard-to-place or unique insurance products, coordinated ancillary services and
consultative professional services. Additionally, we engage in a disciplined acquisition strategy to
expand our products, services, technologies and producer talent. We believe our balanced strategy of
driving internal organic revenue growth supplemented by disciplined acquisitions has produced a
platform that can deliver consistent cash flow and revenue and earnings growth opportunities.

We operate our business through five divisions, as follows:

   - Brokerage. Our Brokerage division, also referred to in this discussion as “Wholesale
Brokerage,” distributes property and casualty insurance products through our retail insurance
brokerage clients.

   - Access. Our Access division distributes small commercial and personal insurance lines
products nationally through our retail insurance brokerage clients primarily under binding
authority contracts pursuant to which insurance carriers have authorized us to underwrite and
distribute these policies on their behalf.

   - Specialty Underwriting. Our Specialty Underwriting division operates our MGU programs.
As an MGU, we have contractual authority from various insurance carriers to underwrite, bind,
issue and administer insurance policies on their behalf. This division also distributes its
products through our retail insurance brokerage clients.

   - Group Benefits. Our Group Benefits division distributes group benefit insurance products
through our retail insurance brokerage clients and provides related administrative services for
insurance carriers that sell these insurance products, self-funded employer health plan
sponsors and insureds.

   - International. Anchored by our Lloyd’s brokerage operation in London, our International
division distributes specialty insurance and reinsurance products to clients worldwide through
offices in strategic countries. Our international division operates under the “Amwins Global
Risks” and “THB” brands.

**Acquisitions/Investments**

Acquisitions of businesses and partnerships with successful entrepreneurs have been and will
continue to be part of our growth strategy. We evaluate acquisitions based on a variety of factors

57


-----

including product and service capability, producer talent, size, geographic and industry fit, operating
performance and the quality of the existing management team. We have structured a number of our
acquisitions to provide for contingent purchase price payments that depend upon the business
reaching specified financial targets in the future (commonly referred to as “earn-outs”). We may use
this structure for any acquisitions we pursue in the future.

The purchase price for acquisitions may include varying combinations of equity of Amwins
Holding (denominated as “units”), cash funded by our existing cash flow, borrowings under our senior
secured credit facilities and, for certain of these acquisitions, an obligation to pay earn-out payments in
units, cash or both.

From time to time, we also make equity investments in businesses that complement, support or
are ancillary to our business. We apply the equity method of accounting to investments when we have
significant influence, but not controlling interest, in the investee. Judgment regarding the level of
influence over each equity investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest,
representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material
intercompany transactions. We assess investments for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. Determining
the fair value of investments in thinly traded public companies and privately held entities could require
using a valuation model, which would include significant judgment and estimates.

During 2022, we acquired two books of business (customer accounts) and Business Risk
Partners, LLC, a managing general underwriter and program administrator for professional and
management liability insurance products. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was
approximately $49.1 million in cash and equity, including our estimated earn-out obligations.

During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we acquired two books of business
(customer accounts) and an international insurance and reinsurance broker that specializes in
insurance placements for the energy and marine industries, and increased our ownership of an
investment in a managing general agent for admitted homeowners insurance accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions was approximately
$179.0 million in cash and equity, including our estimated earn-out obligations.

**Customer Base**

We do business with approximately 34,000 retail insurance brokerage firms, including all of the
100 largest U.S. retail insurance brokers. We also work with thousands of small to mid-sized retail
insurance brokerage firms, many of which do not have direct access to the insurance markets with
which we place business. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, no single retail
insurance brokerage customer accounted for more than 6% of our commissions and fees, and the top
five retail brokerage customers represented less than 19% of our commissions and fees.

**Insurance Carrier Base**

We have relationships with a wide range of insurance carriers, Lloyd’s syndicates and other
MGUs to offer our customers the best option for each risk. The breadth of our relationships with
insurance markets mitigates our risk of concentration with any particular provider of insurance. We
believe our access to a large number of insurance providers reduces the impact of the loss of any
individual carrier on our results of operations and provides our clients with more choices and deeper
access to the insurance marketplace. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, no
single carrier accounted for more than 6% of our total premium volume, and the top five carriers in
aggregate represented approximately 18% of our premium volume.

**Seasonality**

Our business, particularly in our Brokerage and Specialty Underwriting divisions, is subject to
seasonal fluctuations. Commissions, fees, supplemental revenues and contingent revenues, and our
costs to obtain and fulfill the service obligations to our clients, can vary from quarter to quarter as a
result of the timing of policy effective dates. Salaries, employee benefits and depreciation and
amortization expenses generally tend to be recorded uniformly throughout the year.

**Certain Other Trends and Outlook**

Insurance premium pricing within the P&C insurance industry has historically been cyclical based
on the underwriting capacity of the insurance industry and economic conditions. External events, such
as terrorist attacks and natural disasters, can also have a significant impact on the insurance market.
We use the terms “soft market” and “hard market” to describe the business cycles experienced by the
industry. A soft market is an insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates,
which can negatively affect commissions earned by insurance brokers. A hard market is an insurance
market characterized by a period of rising premium rates, which, absent other changes, can positively
affect commissions earned by insurance brokers. Subsequent to the storms that occurred during the
fall of 2017, property pricing turned positive in November 2017 after 47 straight months of declines.
This positive pricing trend continued through the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the pandemic, including supply chain
disruptions, have affected business activity across industries worldwide in virtually every location in
which we operate. Although the global economy has improved from the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, a resurgence of the virus, as well as governmental and societal responses to the virus and
the economic effects of these responses, could directly or indirectly impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of COVID-19 on
our business.

**Revenues**

_Commissions and Fees._ Our commissions and fees consist of commissions paid by insurance
carriers and fees charged for services we provide, net of the portion of the commissions and fees we
pay to retail insurance brokers. The commissions we receive from insurance carriers are typically
calculated as a percentage of the premiums paid for the insurance products we distribute. For property
and casualty products, we typically earn our commissions on the latter of the effective date of the
policy or the date coverage is bound. For group benefits products and services, we typically earn our
commissions and administrative fees monthly based on eligible enrollment. Commission income and
fees generated from outsourced administrative services are recognized ratably over the life of the
underlying policy or contract period. We pay our retail insurance brokerage clients a portion of the
gross commissions we receive from insurance carriers. Insurance carriers often pay a greater
commission rate to wholesale insurance brokers than to retail insurance brokers. Thus, we frequently
are able to pay our retail insurance broker customers a commission rate similar to what they would
receive if they placed business directly.

Because commission rates on the policies we place are generally calculated as a percentage of
the premiums paid for a policy, they are affected by fluctuations in the amount of premium charged by
insurance carriers. These premiums fluctuate based on, among other factors, the amount of capital
available in the insurance marketplace, the type of risk being insured, the nature of the insured party
and the terms of the insurance purchased. If premiums increase or decrease, our revenues typically
move in a corresponding fashion. In a declining premium rate environment, the resulting decline in our

59


-----

revenue may be offset, in whole or in part, by an increase by insurance carriers of their commission
rates and the fact that insured parties may use the savings generated by the reduction in premium
rates to purchase greater coverage. In an increasing pricing environment, the resulting increase in our
revenue may be offset, in whole or in part, by a decrease by insurance carriers of their commission
rates and the fact that insured parties may determine to reduce the amount of coverage they purchase.

_Other Income._ Other income includes profit and other contingent commissions, interest income,
licensing revenue and miscellaneous income, net of contingent commissions paid and payable to our
retail clients. Profit and other contingent commission income is estimated and recognized to the extent
future reversal is not probable. Contingent commission expense payable to our customers is generally
recognized based on the timing of the revenue earned from placing business for these customers.

**Expenses**

Our most significant operating expenses are employee compensation, including bonuses and
benefits, and other operating expenses, which consist primarily of rent, insurance, professional fees,
technology costs, travel and entertainment and advertising. Bonus compensation for a majority of our
brokers is based on a percentage of the revenues they generate, after deducting their base salary
compensation. Bonuses for other employees are discretionary based on an evaluation of their
individual performance and the performance of their particular team or office. A substantial portion of
our depreciation and amortization expense consists of amortization of definite-lived intangible assets,
such as purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements acquired as part of our business
acquisitions.

**Organic Revenue Growth**

We define organic revenue growth as the net change in total revenues for a period, excluding the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations, intercompany reassignments and any non-recurring
adjustments unrelated to that period, compared to the prior-year corresponding period other than any
increase or decrease in revenues attributable to businesses acquired or sold affecting that period.
Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to, nor is
there any implication that it is more meaningful than, any measure of performance or liquidity
promulgated under GAAP. We believe that providing organic revenue growth results is meaningful to
investors due principally to the role acquisitions have played in our revenue growth.

**_Revenues_**

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $103.6 million, or 20.0%.
Excluding acquisitions, the disposal of an international brokerage business and a book of business
(customer accounts) and the impact of foreign exchange rates (primarily the British Pound against the
U.S. dollar), revenues grew organically by $101.0 million, or 19.5%. Revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 increased $299.4 million, or 18.7%. Excluding acquisitions, the disposal of
an international brokerage business and a book of business (customer accounts) and the impact of
foreign exchange rates (primarily the British Pound against the U.S. dollar), revenues grew organically
by $299.7 million, or 18.8%. The organic growth in revenues for both the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 was attributable to organic growth across all five divisions and an increase in
interest income.

**_Wholesale Brokerage_**

Wholesale Brokerage revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased
$45.5 million, or 17.9%, from $254.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 to
$299.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding acquisitions, Wholesale
Brokerage revenues increased organically by $45.4 million, or 17.9%. Wholesale Brokerage revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $151.1 million, or 18.4%, from $822.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $973.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. Excluding acquisitions, Wholesale Brokerage revenues increased organically by
$150.0 million, or 18.2%. The organic growth in revenues for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by favorable market conditions (including property lines
pricing due to catastrophic weather events), increased exposure base, increased market share gains
and the development of younger/less experienced brokers.

**_Access_**

Access revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $13.1 million, or
20.7%, from $63.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 to $76.4 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. On an organic basis, Access revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 increased by $9.9 million, or 14.9%. Access revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 increased $39.8 million, or 20.4%, from $195.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 to $235.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On an organic
basis, Access revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $31.4 million, or
15.4%. The organic growth in revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was
primarily driven by profit commissions across the division’s commercial (E&S) business, an increase in
new business submissions, rate increases in the digital portfolio and other business placed in certain
regions, particularly in the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions, and an increase in the exposure base.

**_Specialty Underwriting_**

Specialty Underwriting revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased
$8.4 million, or 9.1%, from $92.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 to
$100.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. On an organic basis, Specialty
Underwriting revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $9.4 million, or
10.5%. Specialty Underwriting revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased

Underwriting revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $23.5 million, or
9.8%. The organic growth in revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was
primarily driven by increases in the underlying exposure base across a number of our casualty
programs, growth from several recently launched programs, increased profit sharing income generated
by our MGU programs focused on community associations and growth in our property programs
generated by rate increases in that sector.

**_Group Benefits_**

Group Benefits revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $5.7 million,
or 10.1%, from $56.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 to $61.8 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The entire revenue increase was organically driven. Group
Benefits revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $13.7 million, or 7.9%,

62


-----

from $173.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $187.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. On an organic basis, Group Benefits revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 increased by $16.5 million, or 9.7%. The organic growth in revenues for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an increase in in-force premium and
an increase in revenues associated with pharmacy and Rx product offerings.

**_International_**

International revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $12.6 million,
or 27.0%, from $46.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 to $59.4 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the disposal of an
international brokerage business and foreign exchange rates (which, as noted above, was primarily the
British Pound against the U.S. dollar), revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023
increased organically by $12.3 million, or 26.5%. International revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 increased $16.1 million, or 10.2%, from $158.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 to $174.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the
impact of acquisitions, the disposal of an international brokerage business and foreign exchange rates
(primarily the British Pound against the U.S. dollar), revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 increased organically by $20.9 million, or 13.8%. The organic growth for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increased revenues generated by
our Lloyd’s business in London, which benefits from the positive pricing trends affecting the North
American property market.

**_Expenses_**

**_Employee compensation and benefits_**

Employee compensation and benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased
$54.9 million, or 17.6%, compared to 2022. Excluding expenses attributable to an international
brokerage business disposed of during 2023 and expenses related to acquired businesses, employee
compensation and benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $54.7 million, or
17.6%, compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation of
$26.5 million associated with the revenue growth in the period, the effect of prior year investment in
new hires and raises of $19.4 million, and an increase of $6.6 million in benefit costs. In addition, there
was a $2.2 million increase in noncash equity and liability compensation expense due to new award
grants.

Employee compensation and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased
$149.2 million, or 15.8%, compared to 2022. Excluding expenses attributable to an international
brokerage business disposed of during 2023 and expenses related to acquired businesses, employee
compensation and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $147.1 million,
or 15.6%, compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation of
$76.0 million associated with the revenue growth in the period, the effect of prior year investment in
new hires and raises of $52.3 million, and an increase of $17.9 million in benefit costs. In addition,
there was a $0.9 million increase in noncash equity and liability compensation expense due to new
award grants.

**_Other operating expense_**

Other operating expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased
$22.3 million, or 63.9%, compared to 2022. Excluding expenses attributable to an international

63

brokerage business disposed of during 2023 and expenses related to acquired businesses, other
operating expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $22.7 million, or 64.9%,
compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to gains attributable to the sale of unconsolidated
equity investments in 2022 (which was netted against our other operating expenses in 2022), lower
gains on foreign currency transactions in 2023 compared to 2022, increased occupancy expense and
increased travel and entertainment costs.

Other operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $25.1 million,
or 18.8%, compared to 2022. Excluding expenses attributable to an international brokerage business
disposed of during 2023 and expenses related to acquired businesses, other operating expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $25.4 million, or 19.1%, compared to 2022. The
increase was primarily due to lower gains on foreign currency transactions in 2023 compared to 2022,
increased occupancy expense and increased travel and entertainment costs. In addition, in February
2023 we incurred third-party fees in connection with entering into incremental senior secured term
loans under its senior secured credit facilities. This increase was partially offset by gains on
unconsolidated equity investment transactions in 2023.

**_Gain on Disposal_**

In 2023, we recognized a one-time gain of $15.4 million related to the disposal of an international
brokerage business.

**_Depreciation and amortization_**

Depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $5.2 million from
$12.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 to $17.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased
$11.3 million from $37.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $48.5 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to depreciation associated with assets
of acquired businesses as well as capital expenditures on leasehold improvements and internally
developed software.

Amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased $0.6 million from
$17.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 to $17.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased
$2.8 million from $54.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $51.7 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to certain definite-lived
intangible assets becoming fully amortized during 2023.

**_Interest expense_**

Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased
$24.9 million and $65.3 million, respectively, compared to 2022. The increase was due to higher
average debt balances in 2023 as well as an increase in average borrowing costs due to an increase in
the floating rate benchmark used on our adjustable-rate debt. The increase was partially offset by the
impact of interest rate swap agreements.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $19.8 million
resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.1%, as compared to income tax expense of $38.8 million for

64


-----

three months ended September 30, 2022 resulting in an effective tax rate of 37.1%. Income tax
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $114.8 million resulting in an effective
tax rate of 28.9%, as compared to income tax expense of $104.3 million for nine months ended
September 30, 2022 resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.8%. The significant items affecting our
effective tax rate compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 21% include state income taxes, the impact of
foreign operations, gain on the disposition of an international brokerage business and related foreign
withholding taxes, research and development tax credits, certain nondeductible entertainment
expenses, and stock compensation expenses.

**_Net income attributable to Amwins Group, Inc._**

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $82.9 million compared to
$65.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due to the cumulative
effect of the factors discussed above.

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $280.8 million compared to
$220.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due to the cumulative
effect of the factors discussed above.

**_Revenues_**

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $336.1 million, or 18.3%. Excluding
acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rates (which were affected by a weakening of all major
currencies against the U.S. dollar), revenues grew organically by $291.8 million, or 16.0%. The organic
growth in revenues for year ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to organic growth across all
five divisions.

**_Wholesale Brokerage_**

Wholesale Brokerage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $200.6 million,
or 21.9%, from $917.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $1,117.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022. Excluding acquisitions, Wholesale Brokerage revenues increased
organically by $167.4 million, or 18.3%. The organic growth in revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by favorable market conditions (e.g. property lines pricing due
to catastrophic weather events), increases in profit sharing income and the development of younger/
less experienced brokers. This growth was partially offset by slowing new business submissions.

**_Access_**

Access revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $39.6 million, or 18.3%, from
$216.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $256.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Excluding acquisitions, Access revenues increased organically by $24.1 million,
or 10.9%. The organic growth in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven
by growth in our small commercial E&S (excess and surplus) lines and admitted and personal lines
businesses through both the human (production underwriter) and digital distribution channels. The
primary growth drivers were an increase in new business submissions, significant rate increases,
particularly in the southeast and gulf regions, and an increase in the exposure base.

**_Specialty Underwriting_**

Specialty Underwriting revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $52.5 million,
or 18.4%, from $285.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $337.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022. Excluding acquisitions, Specialty Underwriting revenues increased
organically by $40.7 million, or 14.4%. The organic growth in revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by increases in the underlying exposure base across a
number of our casualty programs, the launch of several new programs and growth in our property
programs from rate hardening in that sector.

**_Group Benefits_**

Group Benefits revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $21.7 million, or
9.8%, from $221.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $242.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Excluding acquisitions and after adjusting current and prior year revenues to
eliminate revenues generated by certain accounts sold in 2022, Group Benefits revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2022 increased organically by $23.3 million, or 10.8%. The organic growth in
revenues was due to increases in our stop loss business associated with both block growth and an
increase in profit sharing commissions, growth in small to mid-sized group offerings, and growth in our
PEO employee benefits program associated with an increase in PEPM rates.

**_International_**

International revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $6.2 million, or 3.1%,
from $201.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $207.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange rates (which, as noted
above, were affected by a weakening of all major currencies against the U.S. Dollar), revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022 increased organically by $20.7 million, or 11.1%. The organic growth
was primarily due to increased revenues generated by our Lloyd’s business in London, which benefits
from the positive pricing trends affecting the North America property market, as well as our Brazil and
Chile operations.

**_Expenses_**

**_Employee compensation and benefits_**

Employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased
$235.6 million, or 21.8%, compared to 2021. Excluding expenses related to acquired businesses,
employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $201.6 million,
or 18.7%, compared to 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation
associated with the revenue growth in the period of $79.9 million, the effect of prior year investment in
new hires and raises of $46.7 million, and an increase of $13.1 million in benefit costs. In addition,
there was a $61.9 million increase in noncash equity and liability compensation expense due to new
award grants.

**_Other operating expense_**

Other operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $16.9 million, or
9.5%, compared to 2021. Excluding expenses related to acquired businesses, other operating expense
for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $11.1 million or 6.2%. The increase was primarily
due an increase in travel and entertainment costs partially offset by gains on foreign currency
transactions. In addition, during 2021 we incurred third-party fees in connection with financing
transactions in February 2021 and July 2021, which did not recur in 2022.

**_Depreciation and amortization_**

Depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $8.8 million from $42.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 to $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The
increase was due to depreciation associated with assets of acquired businesses as well as capital
expenditures on leasehold improvements and internally developed software.

Amortization for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $6.1 million from $66.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The
increase was primarily due to additional amortization of definite-lived intangible assets acquired as part
of our acquisitions.

**_Interest expense_**

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $12.3 million compared to
2021 due to an increase in average outstanding debt balances in 2022. This increase was partially
offset by a decrease in the average borrowing costs related to a reduction in the interest rate on our
senior notes issued in July 2021 in relation to our prior senior notes redeemed in July 2021, as
described below under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

-----

**_Loss on extinguishment of debt_**

In connection with the refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities in February 2021 and our
senior notes in July 2021, we incurred a $42.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt consisting of a
prepayment premium and expenses to write-off unamortized original issue discount and unamortized
financing fees and expenses.

**_Nonoperating expense_**

Nonoperating expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased $5.9 million compared
to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a smaller adjustment to our estimated earn-out payable in
2022 as compared to 2021 as a result of changes in the forecasted financial results of certain
underlying acquisitions.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $120.2 million resulting in an
effective tax rate of 30.5%, as compared to income tax expense of $84.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 resulting in an effective tax rate of 29.3%. The increase was primarily a result of
increased pre-tax earnings. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate of 21%
is primarily due to state income taxes, the impact of foreign operations and nondeductible expenses
primarily related to equity-based compensation.

**_Net income attributable to Amwins Group, Inc._**

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $269.7 million compared to
$198.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to the cumulative effect
of the factors discussed above.

**_Revenues_**

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $356.7 million, or 24.0%, compared
to 2020. Excluding acquisitions, disposals and the impact of foreign exchange rates, revenues grew
organically by $243.1 million, or 17.0%. The organic growth in revenues for year ended December 31,
2021 was attributable to organic growth across all five divisions.

**_Wholesale Brokerage_**

Wholesale Brokerage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $243.2 million,
or 36.1%, from $674.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $917.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021. Excluding acquisitions, Wholesale Brokerage revenues increased
organically by $147.9 million, or 22.3%. The organic growth in revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by favorable market conditions, market share gains,
improvements in market pricing and the development of younger/less experienced brokers.

**_Access_**

Access revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $55.9 million, or 34.8%, from
$160.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $216.7 million for the year ended

69


-----

December 31, 2021. Excluding acquisitions, Access revenues increased organically by $23.5 million,
or 14.6%. The organic growth in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven
by growth in our small commercial E&S (excess and surplus) lines and personal lines businesses due
to an increase in new business submissions, rate increases and an increase in the exposure base.

**_Specialty Underwriting_**

Specialty Underwriting revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $76.1 million,
or 36.4%, from $209.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $285.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021. In 2021 certain underwriters were transferred from the Group Benefits
division to the Specialty Underwriting division. Excluding the impact of this transfer and acquisitions,
Specialty Underwriting revenues increased organically by $36.0 million, or 16.2%. The organic growth
in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by increased revenues for
several of our MGU programs due to an increase in the exposure base (payrolls), the launch of new
programs and organic growth across multiple existing product lines.

**_Group Benefits_**

Group Benefits revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $51.4 million, or
18.9%, from $272.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $221.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. As mentioned above, in 2021 certain underwriters were transferred from the
Group Benefits division to the Specialty Underwriting division. Excluding the impact of this transfer,
revenues attributable to a business sold during 2020 and acquisitions, Group Benefits revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2021 increased organically by $11.9 million, or 5.9%. The organic growth in
revenues was due to the timing of profit sharing commissions from certain insurance carriers,
additional revenues associated with small to mid-sized group offerings, and an increase in retiree
benefit revenues and related policy count.

**_International_**

International revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $35.9 million, or 21.7%,
from $165.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $201.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2021 increased organically by $26.9 million, or 15.5%. The organic growth was primarily
due to increased revenues generated by our London, Brazil and Mexico operations.

**_Expenses_**

**_Employee compensation and benefits_**

Employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased
$211.4 million, or 24.4%, compared to 2020. Excluding expenses attributable to a business disposed of
during 2020 and expenses related to acquired businesses, employee compensation and benefits for
the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $144.2 million, or 17.4%, compared to 2020. This
increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation of $87.7 million associated with the
revenue growth in the period, the effect of prior year investment in new hires and raises of $36.8
million, and an increase of $11.1 million in benefit costs. In addition, there was an $8.6 million increase
in noncash equity and liability compensation expense due to new award grants.

**_Other operating expense_**

Other operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $20.9 million, or
13.2%, compared to 2020. Excluding expenses attributable to a business disposed of during 2020 and

70


-----

expenses related to acquired businesses, other operating expense for the year ended December 31,
2021 increased $21.7 million or 15.6%. The increase was primarily due to third-party fees incurred in
connection with financing transactions in February and July 2021 as discussed below under
“—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and increased occupancy expense as a result of expanding our
geographic footprint.

**_Gain on Disposal_**

During 2020, we recognized a one-time net gain of $203.1 million related to the disposal of a
benefit claims adjudication business.

**_Depreciation and amortization_**

Depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $6.6 million from $36.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The
increase was due to depreciation associated with assets of acquired businesses as well as capital
expenditures on leasehold improvements and internally developed software.

Amortization for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $19.8 million from $46.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 to $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The
increase was primarily due to additional amortization of definite-lived intangible assets acquired as part
of our acquisitions.

**_Interest expense_**

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $0.9 million compared to
2020 due to a decrease in the average borrowing costs related to a reduction in the interest rate on our
variable rate senior secured term loans as a result of an amendment to our credit facilities in February
2021 and a lower interest rate on our senior notes issued in July 2021 in relation to our prior senior
notes redeemed in July 2021, as described below under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” This was
partially offset by an increase in average outstanding debt balances in 2021.

**_Loss on extinguishment of debt_**

In connection with the refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities in February 2021 and our
senior notes in July 2021, we incurred a $42.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt consisting of a
prepayment premium and expenses to write-off unamortized original issue discount and unamortized
financing fees and expenses.

**_Nonoperating expense_**

Nonoperating expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $6.8 million compared
to 2020 primarily due to changes in our estimated earn-out payable as a result of changes in the
forecasted financial results of certain underlying acquisitions.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $84.8 million resulting in an
effective tax rate of 29.3%, as compared to income tax expense of $125.9 million for the year ended

71


-----

December 31, 2020 resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.5%. The decrease was primarily a result of
decreased pre-tax earnings attributable primarily to financing costs incurred during 2021 and a gain
recognized on the sale of a business during 2020. The significant items affecting our effective tax rate
compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 21% include state income taxes, the impact of foreign
operations, certain nondeductible entertainment expenses, income/loss related to changes in
estimated earnout accruals for nontaxable transactions, and stock compensation expense.

**_Net income attributable to Amwins Group, Inc._**

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $198.8 million compared to
$312.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to the cumulative effect
of the factors discussed above.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, operating cash and cash
equivalents and funds available under our revolving credit facility.

When considering our liquidity, it is important to note that we also hold cash in a fiduciary capacity
as a result of premiums received from insured parties that have not yet been paid to insurance carriers.
The fiduciary cash is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet with a corresponding liability, net of
our commissions, to insurance carriers and is not available for operating purposes. In addition, for
policy premiums that have been billed but not collected, we record a receivable on our balance sheet
for the full amount of the premiums billed, with a corresponding liability, net of our commissions, to
insurance carriers. We earn interest on the premium cash during the period of time between receipt of
the funds and payment of these funds to insurance carriers.

We believe that operating cash on our balance sheet, funds generated from our operations and
funds available under our senior secured credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our existing
commitments and provide us with adequate financial flexibility for working capital, including the effects
of seasonality, and our current acquisition pipeline. However, if circumstances change, we may need to
raise debt or equity capital in the future.

**_Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 4.875% Senior Notes_**

On February 19, 2021, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities. As
amended, our senior secured credit facilities consisted initially of term loans of $1,995.0 million original
principal amount and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (substantially all of which was available at
close for additional borrowings). The proceeds from these facilities were used to refinance the amounts
outstanding under our prior senior secured credit facilities initially put in place in January 2017
consisting of term loans of approximately $1,986.6 million original principal amount, and to pay related
transaction expenses. By amending our senior secured credit facilities, we were able to extend the
maturity dates of these facilities, reduce our borrowing costs and expand certain of our operating
covenants, among other things.

On July 19, 2021, we completed the offering of $790.0 million aggregate principal amount of our
4.875% Senior Notes made in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act, and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
under the Securities Act. The 4.875% Senior Notes are unsecured and accrue interest at an annual
rate of 4.875%, payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning
on December 31, 2021. The 4.875% Senior Notes will mature on June 30, 2029.

72


-----

In connection with the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes, we incurred incremental term loans
under our senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million.

We used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 4.875% Senior Notes to repay in full
and redeem our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2026 having an outstanding principal amount of
$650.0 million (and $2.5 million of capitalized interest), and to pay a related redemption premium and
all related transaction fees and expenses. We used the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the
4.875% Senior Notes, together with the net proceeds from our incremental term loans and cash on
hand, to pay a dividend in September 2021 to Amwins Holding (and Amwins Holding’s owners), and to
fund payments made or to be made to certain holders of stock options of Amwins Group and unvested
units of Amwins Holding required in connection with the dividend, in an aggregate amount of
$749.9 million.

In February 2023 we incurred additional incremental term loans under its senior secured credit
facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million. We used the proceeds from these
incremental term loans and cash on hand to pay a dividend in March 2023 to Amwins Holding (and
Amwins Holding’s owners), and to fund payments made and to be made to certain holders of stock
options of Amwins Group and unvested units of Amwins Holding required in connection with the
dividend, in an aggregate amount of approximately $924.8 million.

As of September 30, 2023, there was $3,335.5 million of term loans outstanding under our senior
secured credit facilities, net of a $18.4 million original issue discount and $16.4 million of financing
fees, $781.9 million of 4.875% Senior Notes outstanding after giving effect to $8.1 million of financing
fees, and no borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility (which carries
debt issuance costs of $1.6 million) other than undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face
amount of $2.0 million.

The term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities mature on February 19,
2028 and amortize in quarterly installments of approximately $8.6 million with the balance payable on
the maturity date. Term loans in the amount of $2,526.6 million bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or
one-month Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.25%,
and terms loans in the amount of $843.6 million bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or Term SOFR
plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.75%. As of September 30,
2023, these term loans bore interest at a weighted average rate of 7.82% per annum. The revolving
line of credit matures on February 19, 2026 and bears interest at the greater of 0.0% or one-month
Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.25%.

**_Interest Rate Swap Agreements_**

We have entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against a portion of our
variable rate term loans. The notional amount of the swaps is $1.7 billion. We are paying interest at a
weighted average fixed rate of 1.34% on the swaps. We are receiving interest at the greater of the
one-month Compounded SOFR plus a Term SOFR spread adjustment of 0.11% per annum and either
1.00%, with respect to $750 million notional amount of the swaps, or 0.75%, with respect to
$900 million notional amount of the swaps. At September 30, 2023, the receiving weighted average
interest rate is 5.43% on the swaps. The interest rate swap agreements have a weighted average
remaining maturity of 2.2 years at September 30, 2023.

**_Cash Flow_**

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents inclusive of restricted cash totaled $2,280.1 million at September 30,
2023, an increase of $313.3 million from December 31, 2022. Cash and cash equivalents inclusive of
restricted cash totaled $1,966.8 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $386.4 million from
December 31, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents inclusive of restricted cash totaled $1,580.4 million at
December 31, 2021, an increase of $94.6 million from December 31, 2020. The increases were
attributable to the factors set forth below.

**_Cash flows from operating activities_**

Net cash from operating activities primarily consists of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash
items including depreciation and amortization, changes in estimated earn-out payables, equity and
liability compensation expense, deferred income taxes, losses on the extinguishment of debt (when
applicable), gain (losses) on disposals (when applicable) and the effect of changes in working capital
and other activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $657.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, from $372.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The
increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by differences in the receipt
and disbursements of client fiduciary balances in 2023 compared to 2022 and by an increase in net
income.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $571.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, from $529.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net
cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in net income partially offset
by differences in the receipt and disbursements of client fiduciary balances in 2022 compared to 2021.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $529.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, from $384.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net
cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by timing differences in the receipt and
disbursements of client fiduciary balances in 2021 compared to 2020.

**_Cash flows from investing activities_**

Our investing activities primarily consist of purchases or sales of businesses and equity
investments and capital expenditures.

Net cash used in investing activities was $231.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $41.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022. The increase in cash used in investing activities was driven by an increase in
cash paid for acquisitions and equity investments and by an increase in capital expenditures in 2023
compared to 2022.

Net cash used in investing activities was $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
compared to net cash used in investing activities of $337.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2021. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven by a decrease in cash paid for
acquisitions in 2022 compared to 2021.

Net cash used in investing activities was $337.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $173.8 million for the year ended

74


-----

December 31, 2020. The change in net cash from investing activities was primarily attributable to an
increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 compared to 2020 and $226.2 million of proceeds from
disposals made in 2020 which did not recur in 2021.

**_Cash flows from financing activities_**

Our financing activities primarily consist of borrowings and payments under our indebtedness and
the payment of dividends.

Net cash used in financing activities was $112.6 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, compared to $38.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The change in net
cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a dividend paid in March 2023 partially
offset by an increase in net borrowings related to incremental term loans incurred in February 2023, as
discussed above under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
4.875% Senior Notes.”

Net cash used in financing activities was $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,
compared to $91.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in net cash used in
financing activities was primarily attributable to a dividend paid in September 2021 partially offset by an
increase in net borrowings related to the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes and incremental term
loans incurred in July 2021, as discussed above under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and 4.875% Senior Notes.”

Net cash used in financing activities was $91.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to $757.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in net cash used in
financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net borrowings related to the issuance of
our 4.875% Senior Notes and incremental term loans incurred in July 2021, as discussed above under
“—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 4.875% Senior Notes.” In
addition, dividends paid in 2021 decreased $231.7 million compared to 2020.

In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires that a statement of cash flows
explain the change during the period in the aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalents, restricted
cash and restricted cash equivalents. As a result, amounts generally described as restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents are included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the
beginning-of-period and end-of-period cash balances shown on the statement of cash flows. We
adopted this new guidance effective December 31, 2019, and the adoption of this new guidance
changed the presentation of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as we now show the changes
in the aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows.
Previously, the net change in restricted cash was reported as an operating activity, and cash paid for
acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was not presented net of restricted cash.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have,
a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP on a going-concern basis. The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management
to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
We periodically evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. If actual
performance should differ from historical experience or if the underlying assumptions were to change,
our financial condition and results of operations might be materially impacted. In addition, some
accounting policies require significant judgment to apply complex principles of accounting to certain
transactions, such as acquisitions, in determining the most appropriate accounting treatment. See
Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a
detailed description of our critical accounting policies.

On January 1, 2020 we adopted new accounting guidance that requires that a statement of cash
flows explain the change during the period in the aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalents,
restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. As a result, amounts generally described as restricted
cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when
reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period cash balances shown on the statement of cash
flows. We were required to adopt this new guidance for all periods commencing on or after January 1,
2020, and the adoption of this new guidance changed the presentation in our Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows as we now show the changes in the aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalents and
restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. Previously, the net change in restricted cash was
reported as an operating activity, and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was not
presented net of restricted cash.

We believe the following significant accounting estimates and policies are material to our financial
reporting and are subject to a degree of subjectivity or complexity.

**_Revenue Recognition and Reserves_**

Commission income and fees from the sale of property and casualty insurance products are
recorded as of the effective date of the insurance coverage or the date the coverage is bound,
whichever is later. At that point, the earnings process has been completed, and we can reasonably
estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves based primarily on our
historical cancellation experience, as adjusted for significant known circumstances as well as
management’s judgment about known conditions. Commission income from the sale of group benefits
insurance products or services is recognized as earned over the policy or contract period, which
typically corresponds to the monthly billing cycle based on eligible enrollment.

We record a reserve for policy cancellations, which is evaluated periodically and adjusted as
necessary based upon historical cancellation experience. Subsequent commission adjustments are
recognized upon notification from insurance carriers. We utilize our historical actual cancellation
experience to develop an estimated percentage of premiums cancelled. We believe this methodology
is reasonable based on the fact that the data is from a large pool of homogenous transactions. This
percentage is applied to each year’s actual revenue to derive the estimated portion of that year’s
revenues that will be cancelled in a future period. Our historical policy cancellation experience has not
fluctuated materially in the past. However, a change in our historical cancellation experience could
cause us to adjust our estimated reserve in future periods. Cancellation trends could change based on
significant changes in insurance capacity or pricing. In general, we expect policy cancellations to
increase during a market experiencing significant price declines, and we expect cancellations to
decrease during a market experiencing increasing prices.

-----

Profit commission income is estimated and accrued to the extent a significant reversal is not
probable.

**_Acquisitions and Purchase Price Allocations_**

We have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses. These assets
generally consist of purchased customer accounts, carrier relationships, non-compete agreements and
the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (goodwill). The
determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets require
significant judgment and affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges.

All of our business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method. In
connection with these acquisitions, we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased
and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased, which typically consist of purchased
customer accounts, carrier relationships and non-compete agreements. Purchased customer
relationships are amortized based on the expected undiscounted cash flows over the related estimated
lives and contract periods, which range from 6 to 20 years. Trade names and noncompete agreements
are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (5 to 8 years for trade
names and 3 to 5 years for noncompete agreements). Purchased carrier relationships are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated life of 40 years.

Purchased customer relationships obtained from acquired businesses are records and files that
contain information regarding retail broker insurance customers and their accounts that are essential to
maintaining that relationship. Purchased carrier relationships represent the estimated value of the
program management services contract between us and a mutual insurance company. The
management services contract is renewable annually on June 30. We expect the cash flows
associated with the purchased carrier relationship to continue for a minimum of 40 years from the date
of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable
tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized.

In determining the purchase price for the acquisitions, we considered various factors including:
(a) historical and projected revenue streams and operating cash flows of each company; (b) the
management teams and sales personnel; (c) the potential to expand the market for our products/
services through their existing distribution channels; (d) the complementary nature of each company’s
product/services offerings as an extension of the offerings of our existing business; and (e) the
potential for new product/service offerings.

**_Intangible Asset Impairment_**

Goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be
impaired. We classify goodwill and certain trade names as indefinite lived intangible assets not subject
to amortization.

We review for goodwill impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether any
impairment may exist. If we believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than
not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative two-step test is
required; otherwise, no further testing is required. For the quantitative test, we compare the fair value
of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is a potential impairment of goodwill.
Based on the aggregation of our business components, our reporting units correspond to our divisions
described above. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss
would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than

79


-----

its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using an income and market approach which includes
consideration of multiples of revenues, EBITDA and estimated discounted future cash flows.

We completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2022. There were no
events or changes since the period following the annual impairment review through September 30,
2023 that caused us to perform an interim period impairment assessment.

For nonamortizable trade names, we review for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors
to determine whether any impairment may exist. If we believe, as a result of the qualitative
assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the nonamortizable trade name is less
than its carrying value, a quantitative two-step test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required.
For the quantitative test, we compare the fair value of the nonamortizable trade name with its carrying
value to determine if there is a potential impairment. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying
amount of the nonamortizable trade name, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset
to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined on the basis of discounted future
cash flows.

We completed our annual nonamortizable trade names impairment analysis as of December 31,
2022. There were no events or changes since the period following the annual impairment review
through September 30, 2023 that caused us to perform an interim period impairment assessment.

**_Equity and Liability Based Compensation_**

Equity and liability based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair
value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, which is the vesting period. If the vesting terms are not met, no compensation cost is
recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. We use the “modified
prospective” method to account for equity-based compensation. We use the alternative transition
method to determine the accounting of the income tax effects of payments made related to stockbased compensation.

The fair value of common stock for options granted has historically been estimated by
management using a market-based valuation methodology that estimates our enterprise value by
using adjusted EBITDA multiplied by relevant market multiples. We did not obtain contemporaneous
valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist because we had a reliable measure of fair value as a
result of acquisitions and market transactions, negotiated at arm’s-length prices with third parties
throughout the period, which included equity consideration, to support the fair value of our common
stock.

**_Income Taxes_**

We record income tax expense using the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred
income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end
of each period are determined using the currently enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes
are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances may be recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to
the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized. We recognize the tax
benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The
tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on
the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.

**_Derivatives_**

We have entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against a portion of our
variable rate term loans. The terms of the agreements require that we pay a fixed rate on the notional
amount to a bank, and the bank pays us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base SOFR.
We have assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge, and accordingly, changes in
the fair market value of the interest rate swap are reflected in other income. Any differences between
the fair value of the hedge and the item being hedged, referred to as the ineffective portion of the
hedge, is immediately recognized in earnings as other operating expense. The fair market value of this
instrument is determined by quotes obtained from the related counterparties in combination with a
valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows. The valuation of this derivative instrument is a
significant estimate that is largely affected by changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase or
decrease, the value of this instrument will change accordingly.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as
interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We are exposed to market risk through our senior secured
credit facilities and international operations. We use various techniques to manage our risk, including,
from time to time, the use of derivative instruments. We have not entered, and do not plan to enter, into
any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

As of September 30, 2023, there was $3,335.5 million of term loans outstanding under our senior
secured credit facilities, net of a $18.4 million original issue discount and $16.4 million of financing
fees, and no borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility (which carries
debt issuance costs of $1.6 million) other than undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face
amount of $2.0 million. Term loans in the amount of $2,526.6 million bear interest at the greater of
0.75% or Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.25%,
and term loans in the amount of $843.6 million bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or Term SOFR
plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.75%. Interest on the
revolving credit facility is the greater of 0.0% or Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11%
per annum, plus a margin of 2.25%. As of September 30, 2023, these term loans bore interest at a
weighted average rate of 7.82% per annum. Based on our outstanding debt balances at September 30,
2023, an immediate hypothetical change of 10% in the interest rate would cause a change in interest
expense of approximately $8.6 million on an annual basis, net of the effect of our interest rate swap
agreements.

We have entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against a portion of our
variable rate term loans. The notional amount of the swaps is $1.7 billion. We are paying interest at a
weighted average fixed rate of 1.34% on the swaps. We are receiving interest at the greater of the
one-month Compounded SOFR plus a Term SOFR spread adjustment of 0.11% per annum and either
1.00%, with respect to $750 million notional amount of the swaps, or 0.75%, with respect to
$900 million notional amount of the swaps. At September 30, 2023, the receiving weighted average
interest rate is 5.43% on the swaps. The interest rate swap agreements have a weighted average
remaining maturity of 2.2 years at September 30, 2023.

We are subject to exchange rate risk primarily in our U.K.-based wholesale brokerage business
that has a cost base principally denominated in British Pounds and a revenue base in several other
currencies, but principally in U.S. dollars. Based upon our foreign currency rate exposure as of
September 30, 2023, an immediate 10% hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would
not have a material effect on our results of operations.

**BUSINESS**

We are a leading global distributor of specialty insurance products and services. We have
expertise across a diversified mix of property, casualty, professional and group benefits products. We
also offer other value-added services to support some of these products, including policy underwriting,
premiums and claims administration, and actuarial services. Headquartered in Charlotte, North
Carolina, we conduct business through offices in over 120 locations in the United States and 20
locations in 12 foreign countries.

In 2023, we placed over $33 billion in premium volume and more than 1.2 million policies. Our
customers consist primarily of retail insurance brokerage firms who seek our assistance, expertise and
access to certain insurance markets and rely on our specialty knowledge to structure and place
insurance coverage. Through our proprietary enterprise operating system (AmLINK), we maintain the
largest centralized database of P&C, insurance market data in the wholesale insurance industry.
Based on information published in September 2023 by Business Insurance, we believe we are the
largest U.S. P&C wholesale insurance broker and the second largest U.S. wholesale insurance broker
overall based on premiums placed.

We have extensive knowledge of the specialty insurance market, which allows us to assist retail
insurance brokers and others deliver cost-effective coverage solutions to their clients. We have
established relationships with more than 2,500 insurance carriers and markets and more than 34,000
retail insurance brokerage firms. Our size, scale and strong relationships within the insurance
marketplace enhance our ability to provide our customers with comprehensive access to these
markets. We also use our product expertise and relationships with insurance carriers to structure new
insurance programs and products to respond to opportunities and customer needs in the marketplace.

**Products and Services**

We distribute insurance products and services primarily through our five divisions: Brokerage,
Access, Underwriting, Group Benefits and International.

**Brokerage**

Through our retail broker customers, our Brokerage division provides businesses and
governmental entities access to a broad range of specialty P&C insurance products available in the
specialty admitted and E&S markets. We are involved in the placement of many lines of P&C
insurance products, such as property, property catastrophe, general liability, commercial automobile
liability, automobile physical damage, umbrella/excess liability and excess workers’ compensation
insurance. In addition, we also place a broad range of professional and financial insurance products
such as directors’ and officers’, professional liability, cyber liability and employment practices insurance
products. As a value-added intermediary, we offer insurance carriers an efficient variable-cost
distribution platform through our producers who understand their products and underwriting appetite,
and we assist our retail insurance broker customers with virtually all types of P&C and specialty niche
insurance products they may not have the expertise or ability to place directly. For the twelve months
ended September 30, 2023, our Brokerage division represented approximately 51% of our total Pro
Forma Revenues.

**Access**

Our Access division focuses on the placement of P&C insurance for small commercial and
personal lines insurance products, primarily through binding authority arrangements with a wide array

82


-----

of insurance carriers. We launched Access as a stand-alone division in January 2015 to consolidate
our existing small account binding authority business. Since that time, we have expanded Access
through acquisitions and an aggressive recruiting and training program for new underwriters.

Our strategic vision for Access is to efficiently deliver a broad array of options for small
businesses and high net worth individuals. A key driver for success in this division is the ability to
leverage technology to allow our underwriters to quickly deliver an array of coverage options for our
retail clients. We believe we are well on our way to fulfilling this strategic vision. As of September 30,
2023, Access had over 1,100 employees spread across 48 production branches and over 230 teams of
underwriters. Access placed over 500,000 policies annually, most of which involve less than $25,000 in
premium. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our Access division represented
approximately 12% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.

**Underwriting**

Through our Underwriting division, we operate a variety of stand-alone specialty insurance
programs. Under these programs, insurance carriers have authorized us to bind coverage on their
behalf as an MGU for a designated type of risk, business or industry. Our authority to bind insurance is
usually subject to underwriting guidelines, policy limits and pricing parameters that are typically
developed jointly by these carriers and us on a collaborative basis and are specific to each program.

When we serve as an MGU, we generally receive requests for insurance directly from retail
insurance brokers, evaluate the risk based on the information submitted, and decide whether we will
offer a quote for insurance coverage. If our client decides to bind coverage, we issue policies on behalf
of the insurance carriers we represent. Our Underwriting division operates on behalf of insurance
carriers and does not take insurance risk for the policies we bind.

We typically bill and collect premiums on behalf of the insurance carrier. For some of our
programs, we also administer claims. We believe these capabilities further strengthen our relationships
with carriers and retail brokers through a deeper and more connected role in the insurance economic
value chain. In many cases, our insurance carrier partners rely on our product knowledge and access
to targeted risk classes. Certain products we offer within this division are proprietary in nature,
including a property catastrophe product that is only distributed through our Brokerage division.

We have a team of actuaries to support our MGU programs. Our actuarial staff provides actuarial
and catastrophe modeling services to our insurance carrier partners to help monitor the overall
profitability of these programs. Our actuaries also monitor the performance of our programs and work
with our underwriters and insurance carriers to develop rate tracking mechanisms, pricing models and
other underwriting tools. Our ability to analyze loss experience for our MGU programs enables us to be
more proactive in adjusting pricing to ensure we are delivering adequate underwriting returns to our
carrier partners.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our Underwriting division represented
approximately 15% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.

**Group Benefits**

Our Group Benefits division distributes a range of accident and health benefit products, including
major medical, stop-loss, ancillary, retiree medical and prescription drug insurance products designed
for employers and other member groups, such as trade associations, chambers of commerce, unions
and professional organizations. We serve as a general agent (GA) by providing core and specialty

83


-----

benefit products to our customers, who include retail benefit brokers and benefit consultants. We also
serve as the exclusive employee benefits program manager in 14 jurisdictions for the largest
professional employer organization (PEO) in the United States. In that role, we underwrite, manage
and administer health and other employee benefit plans for employer groups that join the PEO. In
addition, we distribute a group Medicare supplemental medical plan as well as a Medicare-approved
prescription drug plan under Part D of the Social Security Act, primarily to employer groups that
historically have offered retiree health benefits to their retired employees and are looking for alternative
solutions. Our Group Benefits division provides products and services for over 57,000 employer groups
that encompass over seven million employee lives. Revenue from this division is generated by an array
of brokerage services (distribution of group health and benefit products), third-party administration
services (for carriers, self-funded employer health plan sponsors and insureds), and underwriting
(MGU for niche health and other benefit insurance programs).

We also place and administer a wide array of group benefit products for member organizations.
These products are acquired by national, regional and local member groups that frequently do not
have the capability or desire to administer these plans and that seek ways to make membership in their
organizations more appealing. Through our relationships with insurance carriers, we are able to help
design customized group benefit plans to address the varying needs of these organizations.

We are able to handle virtually all aspects of administering the types of group benefit products we
place, including plan enrollment, eligibility, billing, collection and claims administration. We have made
a substantial investment in several call centers that we use to provide assistance and support for the
plans we administer. We provide administrative services to both insurance carriers and employers for
plans we distribute as well as plans distributed by others.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our Group Benefits division represented
approximately 10% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.

**International**

Anchored by our Lloyd’s of London brokerage business, our International division places a wide
variety of P&C and financial risk insurance products to businesses as well as both facultative and
treaty reinsurance products. This division provides specialty insurance and reinsurance brokerage
services in the United States and a number of foreign countries. We have subsidiaries operating in
Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Netherlands, South Korea and the United Kingdom. In addition, we
have investments in, or licensing arrangements with, businesses operating in Argentina, Australia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay. Our International division operates under the “Amwins Global
Risks” or “THB” brand names.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our International division represented
approximately 9% of our total Pro Forma Revenues.

**Our Industry**

We operate our business within the wholesale insurance distribution market, but place products
associated with the broader P&C and employee benefits insurance markets.

_Property and Casualty Insurance Market._ P&C insurance brokerage is dependent on the
economic performance of the broader P&C insurance market as brokers receive a commission based
on a percentage of the dollar amount of the premiums placed. The volume of premiums placed is a
function of both insurance rates or premium pricing and the underlying amount of coverage purchased.

84


-----

The amount of coverage purchased is affected by the broader macro-economic conditions within each
market, and there tends to be a high correlation in the United States between GDP growth and the
amount of premiums. Premium pricing is cyclical in nature and varies between “hard” markets in which
premium rates are increasing, as compared to “soft” markets in which rates are declining. Insurance
brokers typically are fee-based businesses that do not assume significant insurance liability risk.

Insurance carriers sell commercial P&C and professional insurance products in the U.S. through
“admitted” insurance carriers, which are carriers that are licensed in the state in which the risk is
located, and “nonadmitted” insurance carriers that sell their products in the E&S lines market. Within
the insurance market, there are standard insurance products and specialty insurance products. For
standard insurance products, insurance rates, forms and coverages are relatively uniform, and
insurance carriers tend to compete for customers primarily on the basis of reputation, financial
strength, price, claims service and commissions. Specialty insurance products are sold to insured
parties with more specialized or complex risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard
insurance products. Although price tends to be a key basis of competition among specialty insurance
carriers, the coverage terms also are an important competitive factor.

_Group Benefits Insurance Market._ Group benefit insurance products are sold by life and health
insurance carriers, which transact business with both wholesale and retail insurance brokers and, in
some cases, directly with the sponsoring organization. Wholesale distributors of group benefit products
generally place specialized group benefit products for unusual, unique or specific types of coverage.
Some wholesale distributors also provide administrative services, such as premium, claims and other
administrative services, to both insurance carriers and sponsoring organizations to support these
products.

_Wholesale Insurance Brokerage Market._ Wholesale insurance brokers act as intermediaries
between insurance carriers and retail insurance brokers by assisting retail brokers place business that
is outside of their core expertise or ability to place directly. Wholesale insurance brokers often provide
retail insurance brokers with specialty and E&S insurance products offered by admitted and
non-admitted insurance carriers. It is not uncommon for retail insurance brokerage firms to use several
wholesale insurance brokerage firms to assist in the placement of insurance. Similarly, insurance
carriers typically distribute their products through multiple wholesale insurance brokerage firms. When
a wholesale broker is used, the wholesale broker will pay a part of its commissions to the retail
insurance broker. In some cases, wholesale insurance brokers act as an MGU for an insurance carrier.
An MGU generally has authority to bind coverage on behalf of an insurance carrier for a specific type
of risk, subject to agreed-upon guidelines and limits. An MGU does not, as such, take underwriting
risks for the products that it distributes.

The wholesale distribution channel allows insurance carriers to distribute their products more
efficiently. Insurance carriers use wholesale insurance brokers because of their product expertise and
distribution capabilities, allowing them to reduce or avoid the infrastructure and personnel costs
associated with maintaining relationships with a large number of retail insurance brokerage firms.
Wholesale insurance brokers typically are compensated by commissions paid by the insurance carrier,
although they can also receive fees in addition to commissions for placing certain insurance policies.
Commissions generally are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium for the underlying
insurance policy. Many factors affect commission rates, including the type of insurance, competition
among insurance carriers for that type of insurance, the particular insurance carrier involved, market
cycles and the nature of the services provided by the wholesale insurance broker. When retail
insurance brokers use wholesale insurance brokers to place coverage, they will agree how to split
commissions paid by the insurance carrier. Historically, insurance carriers have frequently paid a
greater commission rate on products distributed through wholesale insurance brokers because of the
expertise provided by wholesale insurance brokers and because insurance carriers have lower

85


-----

infrastructure and other distribution costs for products distributed through the wholesale distribution
channel. In addition, insurance carriers will sometimes pay wholesale insurance brokers contingent
commissions that depend on the volume or profitability of the business they place for the carrier.

The wholesale insurance brokerage industry has been affected by several macro and micro
changes that have impacted the industry in recent years. Because of consolidation, the industry has
become bifurcated between a few national firms and a large number of smaller regional and local firms.
The national firms are better positioned to work with the largest and most sophisticated carriers due to
a wider breadth of retail broker relationships as well as their technological sophistication. The larger the
wholesale brokerage firm, the more integral they are to the distribution model of the insurance carriers
operating in this segment of the insurance industry. Some specialty insurance carriers have shifted
their focus away from doing business with a large number of retail brokers to selling their products
through targeted distribution to select wholesale insurance brokers who understand their products and
underwriting appetite, which reduces the complexity of their business and shifts costs from fixed to
variable. The retail insurance brokerage industry has seen a large amount of consolidation over
several years as the industry shifts from a high degree of fragmentation to one where several national
platforms have emerged. This trend can have a positive or negative impact on the wholesale
brokerage firms that do business with these retail brokerage firms, depending on their prior relationship
with the consolidating firms and the post-consolidation strategy of the combined firms. Notwithstanding
the substantial consolidation of retail brokerage firms, there are still more than 40,000 retail brokerage
firms operating in the United States.

**Our Competition**

The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive. A number of firms actively compete with
us for clients and access to insurance carriers. Our Brokerage and International divisions compete with
a number of other wholesale insurance brokerage firms, some of which are operated by large retail
insurance brokerage firms, banks or financial service companies, as well as retail insurance brokerage
firms and insurance companies. Some of our competitors are owned by customers.

We primarily compete for business on the basis of relationships, reputation, client service,
expertise in a given specialty line, and program and product offerings. Our ability to tailor our products
and risk management services to meet the needs of retail insurance brokers can be a key
differentiator.

Our Underwriting and Access divisions compete with a variety of sources for standard and
specialized insurance products that provide coverage similar to the types of products we distribute. In
many cases, our competitors are other insurance carriers that offer similar products. In addition, we
frequently compete with small- to mid-sized wholesale brokerage firms that provide products that are
similar to the products offered by our MGU and binding authority programs.

Although there are no large national wholesale insurance brokerage firms that regularly compete
with our Group Benefits division, we compete with a variety of other businesses, including retail
insurance brokers that distribute products similar to the types of products we distribute, insurance
carriers that distribute these products directly through retail insurance brokers or to insured parties,
benefit consultants who are able to assist in the distribution of these products and a number of other
companies that provide group benefit administrative services. Our Group Benefits division competes
for clients on the basis of product design and pricing, product knowledge and the ability to provide
ancillary administrative services, as well as the cost of these services.

**Our Strengths**

_Leading market position, with extensive customer and carrier relationships._ Our size and scale
provide us with a unique position in the wholesale market to better assist our retail insurance
brokerage clients and increase our relevance and position with our insurance carrier partners. As we
increase both our market share with retail brokers and the depth of our relationships with insurance
carriers, we further enhance our value proposition by providing better access to both constituents. We
partner with over 2,500 insurance carriers and markets and maintain more than 34,000 retail brokerage
firm relationships. Our scale and sophistication has led to increasing market clout and enhanced
specialty product knowledge, further enhancing our market leading position. Based on information
published in September 2023 by Business Insurance, we believe we are the largest U.S. P&C
wholesale insurance broker and the second largest U.S. wholesale insurance broker overall based on
premiums placed.

_Diversified business platform._ Our business model is highly diversified by the type of insurance
products offered, the number of carrier and retail broker relationships, and the geographic scope of our
operations globally. We believe our level of diversification helps insulate our business from changes
(both macro and micro) affecting the customers and markets we serve and allows us to generate a
more stable revenue stream. We are not dependent on any retail insurance broker customer (for the
twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, no retail broker customer accounted for more than
6% of our commissions and fees, and our top five retail broker customers accounted for less than 19%
of our commissions and fees) or insurance carrier or market (for the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2023, no individual carrier or market accounted for more than 6% of our premium
volume, and our top five carriers represented approximately 18% of premium volume).

_Proven business model supports sustained growth with robust, recurring cash flow_
_generation._ Our size and scale give us an advantage in terms of our relationships with both our retail
insurance broker clients and our carrier partners. As large retail brokers seek to reduce the number of
wholesale brokers they use, our size and scale make us attractive given the breadth of our access to
carriers and specialty insurance products. Similarly, our size, scale and relationships with retail
brokerage firms make us a key component of the distribution model of insurance carriers that offer the
products we place. Our scale and business flow also enhances our expertise and experience in
specialty risks, allowing us to provide better service to our clients and help our insurance carriers
develop new products. This business model has historically generated steady organic revenue growth
(18.8% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, 16.0% in 2022 and 17.0% in 2021, in
each case compared to the preceding comparable period), expanding Adjusted EBITDA margins
(35.4% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, 34.3% in 2022 and 34.4% in 2021), and
solid cash flow generation.

_Proven consolidator in fragmented industry._ We maintain a broad U.S. and international
platform and have historically used, and expect to continue to use, a disciplined acquisition strategy to
expand our market share, product capabilities, diversification and geographic footprint. We believe this
strategy has enhanced our business and complements our focus on core organic growth and
operational improvement. We are selective about the acquisition targets we pursue. We completed
eight acquisitions since January 1, 2020. We believe our entrepreneurial culture, decentralized
approach to managing our business and centralized support offered by our corporate staff make
Amwins appealing to individuals who have decided to sell their business. Virtually all of the owners of
the businesses we have acquired have remained actively engaged in the business post-acquisition,
which has facilitated the integration of these businesses.

_Experienced management team._ Our Chairman, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer,
President, Chief Financial Officer and division presidents have substantial experience and long
87


-----

standing relationships developed over an average of more than 20 years of experience in the
insurance industry. Our management team draws on its relationships and experience in the industry to
identify opportunities to expand our business and collaborate with insurance carriers to help develop
products to respond to market trends. Through their extensive relationships in the insurance industry,
our management team also contributes to the successful recruitment of key brokers and underwriters
to join Amwins.

**Our Strategy**

_Increase growth by expanding distribution._ We strive to prudently grow our business by
expanding our distribution channels across all of our divisions. Over the last five years, we have hired
over 200 new brokers and underwriters in the United States, excluding brokers hired in connection with
acquisitions. We intend to continue to organically grow our revenue through the addition of new
brokers and underwriters and enhanced penetration of our existing markets. We have generated
organic revenue growth of 18.8% during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and 16.0%,
17.0% and 8.8% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have over 1,200 producers who specialize
in specific product lines or industry classes. We also provide our producers with access to what we
believe is an industry-leading producer training program.

_Access to new markets and products._ We are focused on expanding our access to new markets
and products to better serve the needs of our clients. For example, because certain admitted insurance
carriers will not do business directly with small retail insurance brokerage firms, but will do business
with us, our Access division has acquired a platform to provide these brokerage firms with access to a
greater variety of standard insurance products. We also are actively working to develop new MGU
programs, which represent an attractive growth opportunity given the emergence of alternative
insurance markets and the specialized nature of these programs. In our Group Benefits division, we
continue to explore opportunities to work with our insurance carrier partners to develop new products
that help employers manage the rising cost of health care.

_Focus on operational efficiency and profitability._ We continue to be focused on the efficiency of
our platform and expansion of our underlying profit margins through increased scale and operating
leverage. We use an integrated back-office corporate support team in Charlotte, North Carolina, to
provide our client-facing operations with virtually all of the administrative resources they need,
including human resource, legal, information technology (IT), analytical and actuarial services. As a
result, in most instances our growth (either organically or through acquisitions) can be achieved with
relatively limited incremental expense, which drives a high degree of operating leverage. In addition,
we actively look for opportunities to further use technology to support our business, including using our
AmLINK platform to expand our data and analytics capabilities.

_Pursue opportunistic acquisitions._ We plan to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in a disciplined
manner that will complement our existing business or help us expand into new wholesale distribution
channels or markets. We have substantial experience in selecting and integrating acquisition targets
and are positioned to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that arise. We believe that our
entrepreneurial and operating culture make us an attractive partner to acquisition targets.

**Operations**

As of December 31, 2023, we conduct business through offices in over 120 locations in the
United States and 20 locations in 12 foreign countries. Most of our U.S. operations offices operate
under the “Amwins” brand name. Substantially all of our International division operates under the
“Amwins Global Risks” or “THB” brand names.

88


-----

Although our operations are spread across the world, we strive for our employees and customers
to view us as one company. Substantially all of our U.S. operations are connected through a
centralized IT system. We also have centralized substantially all of our human resources, marketing,
finance, merger and acquisition, legal, licensing, compliance and risk management operations for our
U.S. operations. We are in the process of extending these centralized systems and operations to our
international offices. We also provide our businesses with technical, underwriting and regulatory
support. For our U.S. operations, we have implemented our enterprise operating system, AmLINK, to
centralize the majority of our premium collection, accounting and administrative functions in our
Charlotte service center. Although we have centralized many of our administrative operations, we
remain committed to having a decentralized sales and product development culture to provide our
employees with greater flexibility to adapt to the changing needs of their customers and the
marketplace.

**Sales and Marketing**

Virtually all of our sales and marketing efforts are directed at developing and maintaining
relationships with retail insurance brokers and other customers and key employees of insurance
carriers who underwrite the products we distribute. We seek to develop new business with retail
insurance brokers and other customers who can benefit from our expertise and access to insurance
markets. We also strive to maintain frequent contact with key insurance carrier underwriting personnel
so that we understand their product preferences and they understand our distribution capabilities.

Our decentralized sales culture provides our brokers with the entrepreneurial freedom and
flexibility they need to better serve clients and detect client-specific or market-driven opportunities for
new business. Our sales efforts are driven by individual brokers and underwriters under the direction of
the management of our offices, practice groups and divisions. We foster an environment that
recognizes and rewards cooperation among our brokers. We believe our ability to work in teams helps
us better compete for large and complex accounts.

We support our localized sales efforts through centralized marketing programs. Our marketing
department works closely with each division’s management team to develop a marketing strategy that
best suits each division. We market ourselves through trade publications, trade shows, trade seminars
and other events sponsored by us, as well through our website and other sales and marketing
materials.

**Clients**

We place business for more than 34,000 retail insurance brokerage firms of varying sizes,
ranging from large multinational retail insurance brokers to small one-office firms. Although we do
business with all of the large national retail insurance brokerage firms, we derive a substantial part of
our business from mid-size retail insurance brokers.

**Insurance Markets**

We have relationships with more than 2,500 insurance carriers and markets, including large
insurance carriers operating internationally, smaller insurance carriers operating in the United States,
managing general agents and other risk-bearing vehicles such as syndicates that are members of
Lloyd’s. We periodically review the performance, financial health and ratings of all insurance markets
with which we do business, and we generally advise our clients against doing business with any
insurance carrier failing to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A-” and a financial size
category of at least “VII” (often expressed together in a manner such as “A-, VII”) from A.M. Best
Company, Inc.

89


-----

**Governmental Regulation**

We are subject to federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision that could
reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, restricting
the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services, or
subjecting us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings.

In the United States, we are subject to state licensing requirements for insurance brokers and
third-party administrators and regulations governing the handling and investment of client funds held in
a fiduciary capacity. In addition, most states require that our employees who engage in brokerage
activities in that state be personally licensed by that state. We also are required in many states to
report, collect and remit surplus lines taxes to state taxing authorities for insurance policies placed in
the E&S lines market.

We also are affected by the governmental regulation of insurance carriers. For example, when we
act as a MGU for an insurance carrier, we may be required to comply with laws and regulations
affecting the insurance carrier. Moreover, governmental regulation of insurance carriers with which we
place business can affect how we conduct operations.

With respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to,
among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local
investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased
compliance expenses and increased training and employee expenses. In the United Kingdom, our
Lloyd’s brokerage operations are required to be licensed (and subject to regulation and periodic
examination) by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). Our operations in certain other foreign
countries are subject to similar licensing and regulatory oversight by the local insurance regulator
located in these countries. Generally, such authorities are vested with broad discretion to grant, renew
and revoke licenses and approvals, to implement regulations and to inspect and regulate the affected
businesses. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from conducting some or all
of our activities, fined or otherwise penalized in a given jurisdiction and required to comply with certain
restrictions on the operations of our business, including restrictions requiring us to maintain cash
reserves in our foreign businesses. In addition, the FCA regulates the ability of our Lloyd’s brokerage
operations to pay dividends, as do the local regulatory authorities that govern the operation of certain
of our subsidiaries in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2023, we employed over 7,300 employees, none of whom is represented by
a labor union. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

**Legal Proceedings**

In the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings
relating to our business. We maintain errors and omissions and employee practices insurance that is
intended to cover many of these claims. Based on the information available and discussions with legal
counsel, we do not believe that any pending or threatened proceedings will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Operating Agreement**

Amwins Holding has entered into an operating agreement with the Dragoneer/SkyKnight Group,
PSP Investments, Genstar Capital and the Employee/Owners. The operating agreement contains
agreements among the owners of Amwins Holding regarding, among other things, the appointment of
persons to serve on the board of managers of Amwins Holding and the board of directors of Amwins
Group, provisions that provide each Investor with the right to approve certain actions, provisions
relating to the issuance, classification, repurchase, transfer and sale of equity in Amwins Holding,
including tag-along rights, information rights, indemnification rights and other corporate governance
provisions. Amwins Holding currently has a ten-person board of managers, consisting of two managers
appointed by Dragoneer Group, two managers appointed by PSP Investments, one manager
appointed by Genstar Capital, our Chief Executive Officer, two managers appointed on behalf of the
Employee/Owners and two outside managers who are required to be individuals who do not have a
material interest in or involvement with Dragoneer Group, PSP Investments or Amwins (other than the
ownership of equity interests).

**Indemnification Agreement**

We have entered into an amended and restated indemnification agreement pursuant to which we
have agreed to indemnify the Dragoneer Group, PSP Investments, their affiliates and persons they
appoint to serve on our boards for all claims, obligations, liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties,
certain other amounts and expenses incurred by them:

   - under any securities or other laws in connection with any offering by us of any equity or debt
securities;

   - in connection with the performance of any services for us;

   - in connection with serving as a director, officer or manager of Amwins, including any breach or
alleged breach of any fiduciary duty; or

   - in connection with any proceeding involving the Investors or their affiliates or representatives
on our boards that arise in connection with activities on our behalf or in furtherance of our
interests or in connection with their ownership of our equity interests.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are not required to indemnify the Investors (or their affiliates or
board representatives) for any obligations resulting from their gross negligence, willful misconduct or
fraud. Under the indemnification agreement, if for any reason the indemnification obligations described
above are not available, we are required to contribute to the amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of any such obligation.

**Registration Rights Agreement**

Amwins Holding has entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement
pursuant to which the Dragoneer Group and PSP Investments each has the right, after we complete an
initial public offering, to demand that we register their equity for sale under the Securities Act. Owners
of Amwins Holding have certain “piggyback rights” to include their equity interests in a registered public
offering in which the Dragoneer Group or PSP Investments is selling their equity interests. Subject to
certain limitations, we are required to pay the expenses of these registrations, excluding any
underwriting discounts and commissions of the selling owners, as well as the fees and expenses of
one counsel retained by Dragoneer Group and PSP Investments.

-----

**Transactions with Related Businesses**

We do business with and perform services for certain businesses in which the Dragoneer/
SkyKnight Group, PSP Investments, Genstar Capital or one or more of our executive officers or
directors has an interest or serves on the board of directors. For the years ended December 31, 2020,
2021 and 2022, the amount of revenues generated through transactions with these businesses was
immaterial to our operating results. In addition, certain of our employees, including certain of our
executive officers, have interests in businesses that do business with companies with which we do
business. We also lease office space from certain of our current and former employees, but the lease
expense we incur under these leasing arrangements is not material to our operating results.

**November 2023 Equity Recapitalization**

In November 2023, Amwins Holding completed an equity recapitalization in which the Dragoneer/
SkyKnight Group and Genstar Capital increased their ownership of Amwins Holding by purchasing
units of Amwins Holding from certain Employee/Owners who elected to sell a portion of their units,
including members of our senior management team, and PSP Investments, which retained a significant
ownership interest in Amwins Holding. The price of the units purchased by the Dragoneer/SkyKnight
Group and Genstar Capital was determined through arms-length discussions among the Company,
PSP Investments, the Dragoneer/SkyKnight Group and Genstar Capital, and the per-unit price paid in
the recapitalization was the same for each seller and the same price at which certain Amwins
employees purchased Amwins units in a concurrent unit purchase opportunity. The per-unit price was
based on the valuation model used for various purposes, including in connection with the issuance of
units in acquisition transactions, the issuance of stock options, and investments in Amwins Holding.

**Other Transactions with Employees and Directors**

Certain members of our senior management are party to employment agreements with us. In
addition, we adopted an equity incentive plan effective April 2020. From time to time, we may also
adopt other cash and equity incentive-based arrangements to compensate our management and other
employees.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following describes the material terms of our indebtedness, other than with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes.

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

_Overview._ On February 19, 2021, we entered into our amended and restated senior secured
credit facilities. As amended, our senior secured credit facilities consisted initially of term loans of
$1,995.0 million original principal amount and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (substantially all
of which was available at close for additional borrowings). The proceeds from these facilities were used
to refinance the amounts outstanding under our prior senior secured credit facilities initially put in place
in January 2017 consisting of term loans of approximately $1,986.6 million original principal amount,
and to pay related transaction expenses. On July 19, 2021, concurrently with the issuance of our
4.875% Senior Notes, we incurred incremental term loans of $600.0 million in original principal amount.
On February 15, 2023, we incurred additional incremental term loans of $850.0 million in original
principal amount (the “2023 Incremental Term Loans”).

As of September 30, 2023, there was $3,370.2 million in aggregate principal amount of term
loans outstanding under these facilities and no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility
other than undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face amount of $2.0 million. The revolving
credit facility matures February 19, 2026, and the term loan facility matures February 19, 2028. We
have the ability to request incremental term loan and revolving credit facilities from the existing lenders
under the senior secured credit facilities or from additional lenders from time to time. The aggregate
amount of such incremental facilities permitted under the senior secured credit facilities is unlimited,
subject to satisfaction of various terms and conditions set forth in the senior secured credit facilities,
including our ability to meet certain financial covenant levels.

_Interest and Fees._ Borrowings of term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an
applicable margin plus, at our option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of
(a) the prime rate of Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, (b) the Federal Funds effective rate plus
0.50% and (c) the one-month term SOFR rate plus a credit adjustment spread of 0.11448% (the sum
of which shall not be less than 0.75%) plus 1.00%, or (2) a term SOFR rate plus a credit spread
adjustment for the interest period relevant to such borrowing (the sum of which shall not be less than
0.75%). The applicable margin for borrowings of term loans (other than the 2023 Incremental Term
Loans) ranges from 2.00% to 2.25% with respect to term SOFR borrowings and from 1.00% to 1.25%
with respect to base rate borrowings, and is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on our
public corporate family rating from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and public corporate credit rating
from S&P Global Ratings. The applicable margin for borrowings of 2023 Incremental Term Loans is
2.75% with respect to term SOFR borrowings and 1.75% with respect to base rate borrowings.

Borrowings of revolving loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin
plus, at our option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the prime rate of
Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, (b) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (c) the
one-month term SOFR rate plus a credit adjustment spread of 0.11448% (the sum of which shall not
be less than zero) plus 1.00%, or (2) a term SOFR rate plus a credit spread adjustment for the interest
period relevant to such borrowing (the sum of which shall not be less than zero). The applicable margin
for borrowings of revolving loans is 2.25% with respect to term SOFR borrowings and 1.25% with
respect to base rate borrowings. The undrawn amount of the revolving credit facility is subject to a
commitment fee at an annual rate of 0.50%, and outstanding letters of credit are subject to a letter of
credit participation fee at an annual rate equal to the applicable margin for term SOFR loans (adjusted
quarterly) and a fronting fee at an annual rate of 0.25%.

98


-----

_Prepayments._ The senior secured credit facilities require us to prepay outstanding term loans,
subject to certain exceptions, with:

   - 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0% if our first lien net leverage ratio meets
certain thresholds) of annual excess cash flow;

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions
of property by us or any of our restricted subsidiaries (including insurance and condemnation
proceeds), subject to de minimis thresholds and to pro rata prepayment of any other
indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the term loans that is required to be prepaid
with such net cash proceeds, to the extent we do not reinvest these net cash proceeds in
assets to be used in our business (1) within 365 days of the receipt of such net cash proceeds
or (2) if we commit within 365 days of receipt to reinvest such net cash proceeds, within 18
months of the receipt thereof to the extent not reinvested; and

   - 100% of the net proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of indebtedness by us or any of our
restricted subsidiaries, other than indebtedness permitted under the senior secured credit
facilities.

_Amortization._ We are required to make amortization installment payments on the term loans in
equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the funded total principal amount (with adjustments as are
necessary in order to provide for the “fungibility” of incremental term loans), with the remaining
outstanding principal amount to be payable on the maturity date for the term loan facility, which is
February 19, 2028. Principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility will be due and
payable in full on the maturity date for the revolving credit facility, which is February 19, 2026.

_Guarantees and Collateral._ All obligations under the senior secured credit facilities are
unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to certain exceptions, each of our material current
and future domestic restricted subsidiaries. All obligations under the senior secured credit facilities, and
the guarantees of such obligations, are secured by substantially all of the following assets of us and
each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions, including:

   - a pledge of 100% of the capital stock of Amwins and 100% of the equity interests directly held
by us and each Guarantor in any “first-tier” subsidiary of ours or any Guarantor (which pledge,
in the case of any foreign subsidiary directly held by a U.S. subsidiary that is treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes or any U.S. holding company of any such foreign
subsidiary, will not include more than 65% of the voting stock of such foreign subsidiary or U.S.
holding company, as the case may be), subject to certain exceptions; and

   - a security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible assets of ours
and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.

_Certain Covenants._ The senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants that,
among other things, restrict the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to (subject to certain
exceptions):

   - incur indebtedness;

   - grant liens;

   - make acquisitions and other investments (including loans and advances);

   - engage in mergers or consolidations;

   - sell assets, including pursuant to a sale-and-leaseback transaction;

   - pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock;

99


-----

   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

   - change its lines of business;

   - amend material agreements governing its subordinated indebtedness; and

   - repay subordinated indebtedness.

The senior secured credit facilities also contain certain customary affirmative covenants. The
availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions (including our ability to
pay certain dividends) may also be subject to compliance with certain leverage ratios. In addition, the
revolving credit facility includes a springing financial covenant that requires compliance with the first
lien net leverage ratio. The financial covenant will be tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter when
the aggregate amount of revolving loans outstanding exceeds 30% of the revolving credit commitments
on the last day of the fiscal quarter.

_Events of Default._ The senior secured credit facilities contain events of default including, but not
limited to, nonpayment of principal or interest, violation of covenants, breaches of representations and
warranties, cross-default to other indebtedness, bankruptcy and other insolvency events, material
judgments, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of loan documentation, and change of control.

**4.875% Senior Notes due 2029**

On July 19, 2021, we issued $790.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes
maturing on June 30, 2029. Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes accrues at the rate of 4.875% per
annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each year, which
interest payments commenced on December 31, 2021.

We may redeem all or a portion of the 4.875% Senior Notes on or after June 30, 2024 at the
redemption prices set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if
redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on June 30 of the years set forth below:

In addition, we may redeem on one or more occasions prior to June 30, 2024 up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Senior Notes at a redemption price of 104.875% of the
aggregate principal amount being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date,
with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings the proceeds of which are received by or
contributed to us. Finally, we may redeem all or a portion of the 4.875% Senior Notes at any time prior
to June 30, 2024 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being
redeemed plus the applicable premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, the applicable
redemption date. The applicable premium, as of any redemption date, equals the greater of (i) 1.00%
of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed and (ii) the excess of (A) the sum of the present
value at such redemption date of (1) the redemption price of the notes being redeemed on June 30,
2024 (as described in the immediately preceding paragraph exclusive of any accrued interest) plus
(2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on the notes being redeemed through
June 30, 2024 (but excluding accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date), discounted using a
rate based on the constant maturity adjusted yield for actively traded U.S. Treasuries of an appropriate
tenor, over (B) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed on such redemption date.

100


-----

The holders of our 4.875% Senior Notes have the right to require that we repurchase their notes
at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount to be repurchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, if any of the following were to occur:

   - the sale of all or substantially all assets of Holdings and its subsidiaries;

   - Holdings ceases to own all of our capital stock at any time prior to a qualified public offering; or

   - a person or group obtains majority voting control of Holdings.

The 4.875% Senior Notes are unsecured but are guaranteed by Holdings and our domestic
restricted subsidiaries that also guarantee our senior secured credit facilities. The 4.875% Senior
Notes require that any other domestic subsidiary of Holdings that guarantees any indebtedness under
our senior secured credit facilities or any other capital debt securities of us or of a guarantor of the
4.875% Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25.0 million must also guarantee
the 4.875% Senior Notes.

The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees:

   - are general unsecured senior obligations of us and the guarantors thereof, respectively;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness
(including our senior secured credit facilities);

   - are effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness (including our senior secured
credit facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness;

   - are senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness; and

   - are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other claims and
liabilities, including preferred stock, of subsidiaries of Holdings that are not guarantors of the
4.875% Senior Notes.

The 4.875% Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict or limit our ability to, among other
things, dispose of our assets, incur additional indebtedness and guarantees, grant liens on our assets,
merge or consolidate, pay dividends, redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions, make
acquisitions and other investments, enter into transactions with our affiliates, and place limitations on
distributions from restricted subsidiaries. If the 4.875% Senior Notes were to be rated investment grade
by both Moody’s and S&P, we would no longer be subject to a number of the restrictions and
limitations imposed by these covenants, including, among other things, limitations or restrictions on our
ability to incur additional indebtedness and guarantees, merge or consolidate, pay dividends, redeem
or repurchase stock or make other distributions, make acquisitions and other investments, dispose of
our assets, and enter into transactions with our affiliates.

The 4.875% Senior Notes provide that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our
obligations thereunder may be accelerated. These events of default include, among other things,
payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, voluntary and involuntary
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, appointment of a receiver over assets, and enforcement of
judgments.

As of September 30, 2023, there was $790.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875%
Senior Notes outstanding.

**Finance Lease Obligations**

From time to time we enter into leasing arrangements that are required by GAAP to be treated as
finance leases on our financial statements. We historically have entered into these arrangements

101


-----

primarily in connection with leasing certain office equipment. At September 30, 2023, the aggregate
amount payable under such arrangements was approximately $6.8 million on a discounted basis.
Substantially all of the lease obligations is payable over three years. See “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Contractual Obligations.”

Guarantor, including its guarantee of all Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the
Existing Senior Notes;

   - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor,
including its guarantee of the Obligations under the Existing Senior Notes, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral (after giving effect to the sharing of such value with the holders of senior,
equal or prior ranking Liens on the Collateral);

   - secured on a senior priority basis (subject to Permitted Liens and certain other exceptions),
equally and ratably with all existing and future Equal Priority Obligations of such Guarantor
(including its Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement) by Liens on the Collateral;

   - effectively equal in priority with (but without regard to the control of remedies) all existing and
future Equal Priority Obligations of such Guarantor (including its guarantee of all Obligations
under the Senior Credit Agreement) to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving
effect to the sharing of such value with holders of senior or prior ranking Liens on such
Collateral);

   - effectively junior to all of the Company’s other indebtedness that is secured by liens on other
assets of the Company that does not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of those
other assets;

   - senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of such
Guarantor; and

104


-----

   - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities,
including Preferred Stock, of any Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

All of Holdings’ Subsidiaries (other than the Company) are also Subsidiaries of the Company. Not
all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to
distribute any of their assets to the Company or Guarantors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Senior Secured Notes—The Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees will be structurally
subordinated to all liabilities of any current and future non-guarantor subsidiaries.”

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. Any
Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all
guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount
equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of
all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. If a Guarantee
were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness (including
guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such
Indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a
court to void the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes and guarantees and require Secured Noteholders to return payments received, and if
that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Senior Secured Notes.”

Each Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically
and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(a) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger, consolidation, amalgamation,
dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including any
sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case, if such
sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the
Indenture;

(b) the release or discharge of the guarantee or direct obligation by such Subsidiary Guarantor
of the Senior Credit Agreement and, if applicable, the guarantee which resulted in the creation of such
Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct
obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release and
that if any such guarantee or direct obligation is reinstated then such Guarantee shall also be
reinstated to the extent required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
Secured Note Guarantees”);

(c) the proper designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(d) the Company exercising the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Company’s obligations under
the Indenture being satisfied and discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(e) the merger, consolidation or amalgamation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or
another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, consolidation or amalgamation, or upon
the liquidation of a Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets to the Company or another
Guarantor.

105


-----

The Guarantee by Holdings shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(a) the Company exercising the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Company’s obligations under
the Indenture being satisfied and discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(b) the merger, consolidation or amalgamation of Holdings with and into the Company or
another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, consolidation or amalgamation, or upon
the liquidation of Holdings following the transfer of all of its assets to the Company or another
Guarantor.

**Ranking**

The Indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be senior
secured obligations of the Company or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, and will rank
equal in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Company and such
Guarantor, as the case may be, including the Obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under
the Senior Credit Agreement, the Existing Senior Notes and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture. The
Senior Secured Notes Obligations, the Indenture and the Guarantees are secured on a senior priority
basis (subject to Permitted Liens and certain other exceptions) by Liens on the Collateral, equally and
ratably with all existing and future Equal Priority Obligations of the Company and the applicable
Guarantor, including Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement. Such Obligations are effectively
senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantors (including
Obligations under the Existing Senior Notes), to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving
effect to the sharing of such value with holders of senior, equal or prior ranking Liens on the Collateral).
The Senior Secured Notes Obligations, the Indenture and the Guarantees are effectively equal in
priority with (but without regard to the control of remedies) all existing and future Equal Priority
Obligations of the Company and the Guarantors (including the Obligations under the Senior Credit
Agreement) to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to the sharing of such value
with holders of senior or prior ranking Liens on such Collateral). The phrase “in right of payment” refers
to the contractual ranking of a particular Obligation, regardless of whether an Obligation is secured.

As of September 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the sale of the Senior
Secured Notes, Holdings and its Subsidiaries would have had $4.9 billion aggregate principal amount
of Indebtedness outstanding, $4.1 billion of which would have been secured indebtedness. In addition,
as of September 30, 2023, $298.0 million would have been available for borrowing under the revolving
credit facility under the Senior Credit Agreement (after giving effect to undrawn letters of credit having
an aggregate face amount of $2.0 million).

Substantially all of the operations of Holdings and the Company are conducted through the
Company’s Subsidiaries. Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such
Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such
Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries
over the claims of creditors of the Company, including the Holders of Senior Secured Notes. The
Senior Secured Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of Indebtedness and other
creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company
that are not Guarantors. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness by, and the
issuance of Disqualified Stock and preferred stock of, certain of the Company’s Subsidiaries, such
limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

All of Holdings’ Subsidiaries (other than the Company) are also Subsidiaries of the Company. Not
all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. In the event of a

106


-----

bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and other liabilities, including their trade creditors and
holders of their preferred stock, if any, before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the
Company or Guarantors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes—The Senior
Secured Notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any current and
future non-guarantor subsidiaries.” For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023,
non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented 8.7% and 6.6% of the Pro Forma Adjusted Revenues and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, of the Company, on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries.
In addition, as of September 30, 2023, these non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented 12.0% and 8.7%
of the assets and liabilities (excluding intercompany assets and liabilities), respectively, of the
Company, on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that
Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such
Indebtedness could be substantial. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the
incurrence of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Company will maintain one or more paying agents for the Senior Secured Notes. The initial
paying agent for the Senior Secured Notes will be the Trustee.

The Company will also maintain a registrar. The initial registrar will be the Trustee. The registrar
will maintain a register reflecting the registered Holders outstanding from time to time and will make
payments on and facilitate transfer of Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Company.

The Company may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders.
Holdings, the Company or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the Indenture,
including the transfer restrictions therein. The Indenture may require a Holder to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents to the registrar, the Trustee or the Company in connection with
a transfer of Senior Secured Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The
Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Secured Note selected for redemption or
tendered (and not validly withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer, an
Asset Sale Offer or other tender offer. Also, the Company will not be required to transfer or exchange
any Secured Note for a period of 10 days before the sending of a notice of redemption of Senior
Secured Notes to be redeemed.

The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of the Senior Secured Notes for all purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes in
this offering. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on, 2029. Subject to compliance with the
covenant described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of

107


-----

Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the Company may issue
additional Senior Secured Notes from time to time after this offering under the Indenture (“Additional
_Senior Secured Notes”). Any Additional Senior Secured Notes subsequently issued under the_
Indenture will be treated as a single class with the Senior Secured Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided, however,
that a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for the Additional Senior Secured Notes, unless the
Senior Secured Notes and the Additional Senior Secured Notes are treated as fungible for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Additional Senior Secured Notes that are Regulation S Senior Secured Notes
shall have a separate CUSIP or ISIN during the applicable restricted period. Unless the context
requires otherwise, references to “Senior Secured Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture and this
“Description of Senior Secured Notes” include any subsequent Additional Senior Secured Notes that
are actually issued.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be
payable semiannually in arrears on and, commencing on, 2024 to
the Holders of record of Senior Secured Notes on the immediately preceding and
(whether or not a Business Day). Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including
the Issue Date. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months. If any interest payment date, the maturity date or any earlier
required purchase or Redemption Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment
will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest on such payment will accrue in
respect of the delay. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000
and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be payable at the
office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose as described under “—Paying Agent and
Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes” or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be
made by check mailed to the Holders thereof at their respective addresses set forth in the register of
Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or
its nominee will be made in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures. Until otherwise designated
by the Company, the Company’s office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such
purpose.

**Security**

**_Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees thereof will be secured by
Liens on the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with all Equal Priority Obligations. The Liens on
the Collateral that will secure the Senior Secured Notes and Guarantees will be granted under the
Notes Security Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of itself, the Trustee and the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Liens on the Collateral that secure the Obligations under the
Senior Credit Agreement (the “Secured Credit Facility Obligations”) will be granted to the Bank
Collateral Agent pursuant to separate security documentation. The relative rights among the creditors
of the Secured Credit Facility Obligations and the holders of the other Equal Priority Obligations
(including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) will be governed by the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement as set forth below under the caption “—Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.” The
Collateral comprises substantially all of the assets and property of the Company and the Guarantors,
whether real, personal or mixed, other than the Excluded Assets and other than any assets released
from the Collateral.

108

Collateral held by the Company or any Guarantor will exclude the following assets and property
(“Excluded Assets”), including, without limitation:

(1) any Trademark applications filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the

such Trademark has been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to
Section 1(c) or Section 1(d) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. §1051, et seq.), whereupon such Trademark
application will be deemed automatically included in the Article 9 Collateral, but solely to the extent that
granting the Security Interest in such Trademark application prior to such filing would adversely affect
the enforceability or validity of such Trademark application or any registration issuing therefrom;

(2) any assets subject to (i) a Lien securing Financing Lease Obligations or purchase money

any other Lien on such assets or shall constitute or result in a breach or would give the other party
thereto the right to terminate such contract or agreement (other than to the extent that any such
prohibition is rendered ineffective pursuant to the UCC of any relevant jurisdiction or any other
applicable law);

(3) any Excluded Equity Interests;

(4) any Excluded Deposit Accounts;

(5) any leaseholds of real property and any owned real property interests having a value of
$20.0 million or lower;

as the grant of such Security Interest (a) shall be prohibited by any valid and enforceable provision of
any contract, agreement, instrument or indenture governing such General Intangible, Deposit Account,
Securities Account, Account Receivable, lease, license contract, property right or agreement, (b) would
give any other party to such General Intangible, Deposit Account, Securities Account, Account
Receivable, lease, license, contract, property right or agreement the right to terminate its obligations
thereunder, (c) is permitted only with the consent of another party to such Deposit Account, Securities
Account, Account Receivable, lease, license contract, property right or agreement, if such consent has
not been obtained, (d) shall constitute or result in the abandonment, invalidation or unenforceability of
any right, title or interest of the Company or any Guarantor therein, (e) shall constitute or result in a

9-408 or 9-409 of the UCC (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any
other applicable law (including Bankruptcy Laws) or principles of equity; provided, however, that such

such General Intangible, Deposit Account, Securities Account, Account Receivable, lease, license,
contract, property right or agreement that does not constitute or result or no longer constitutes or
results in any of the conditions or consequences specified in the immediately preceding clauses
(a) through (f) above.

(1) more than 65% of the issued and outstanding voting Equity Interests of any Foreign
Subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any Foreign Sub

Grantor’s right, title or interest in Excluded Assets.

Capitalized terms in this definition but not defined shall have the meanings set forth in the
Uniform Commercial Code.

**_Certain Limitations on the Collateral_**

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company or any
Guarantor in connection with the issuance and sale of the Senior Secured Notes. The value of the
Collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on many factors. Consequently, liquidating the
Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Senior
Secured Notes. The Collateral securing our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees is shared with other creditors. If there is a default, the value of the Collateral may not be
sufficient to repay the creditors of Equal Priority Obligations, including the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on a number of
factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly
sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be
received upon a sale of the Collateral will be dependent on numerous factors, including the actual fair
market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of
buyers. By its nature, some of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value or market. In the event of a foreclosure, insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding
or other similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the
Collateral will be sufficient to pay the Company’s and the Guarantors’ Obligations in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. Under U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, any claim for the
difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Senior Secured Notes from the sale
of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Obligations in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes and the Guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s and the
Guarantors’ other unsecured or undersecured senior Indebtedness and other unsubordinated
Obligations, including trade payables. To the extent that third parties establish Liens on the Collateral,

111


-----

such third parties could have rights and remedies with respect to the assets subject to such Liens that,
if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent or the
holders to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. The Company may also issue Additional Senior
Secured Notes after the Issue Date as described herein or otherwise incur Equal Priority Obligations
that would be secured by the Collateral, the effect of which would be to increase the amount of
Indebtedness secured equally and ratably by the Collateral. The ability of the holders to realize on the
Collateral may also be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral—Bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the ability of
holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize value from the Collateral.”

**_Release of Collateral_**

The Company and the Guarantors are entitled to the automatic releases of property and other
assets included in the Collateral from the Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes under any one or
more of the following circumstances:

(1) in part, as to any property or assets constituting Collateral, to enable us to consummate the
disposition of such property or assets (to a Person that is not the Company or a Guarantor) to the
extent permitted under the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales”;

(2) such property or assets becoming an Excluded Asset or Excluded Equity Interests;

(3) as to the assets owned by a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon such Subsidiary Guarantor’s
Guarantee being released in accordance with the provisions described under “—Guarantees” above;

(4) as described under “—Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement”; and/or

(5) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

The security interests in all Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes also will be released
automatically upon (i) payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest and
premium, if any, on, the Senior Secured Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture, the
Guarantees and the Notes Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such
principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, are paid (including pursuant
to a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as described below under “—Satisfaction and
Discharge” or through redemption or repurchase of all of the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise) or
(ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as described below under “—Legal
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.” In connection with a release of Collateral that requires
execution by the Collateral Agent, only an Officer’s Certificate to the Collateral Agent will be required
and neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall have any liability for releases given in reliance on
such Officer’s Certificate (which shall also certify that the release of Collateral is authorized or
permitted under the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents).

**_Creation and Perfection of Certain Security Interests Post-Closing_**

Certain security interests in the Collateral may not be created or perfected on the Issue Date. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral—Any future pledge of Collateral or any guarantee
issued in favor of the holders of Notes might be avoidable in bankruptcy or otherwise.” To the extent
any such security interest could not be created or perfected by such date, the Company and the
Guarantors will agree use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done
all acts and things that would be required to have all security interests in the Collateral duly created

112


-----

and enforceable and perfected, subject to certain permitted exceptions, including exceptions based on
immateriality thresholds of aggregate assets as set forth in the Notes Security Documents, to the
extent required by the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents within 90 days (or such later date as
the Bank Collateral Agent may have agreed to with respect to the corresponding requirement under the
Senior Credit Agreement) of the Issue Date; provided that the Company and Guarantors will enter into
a security agreement and file Uniform Commercial Code financing statements on or around the Issue
Date. There will be no independent assurance prior to issuance of the Senior Secured Notes that all
assets or properties contemplated to be pledged as security for the Senior Secured Notes will be
pledged, or that we hold the personal property interests we represent we hold or that we may pledge
such interests, or that there will be no lien encumbering such personal property interests other than
those permitted by the Indenture. Delivery of security interests or perfection thereof in Collateral after
the Issue Date increases the risk that the security interests could be avoidable in an insolvency or
liquidation proceeding. Additionally, the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents entered into in
connection with the Senior Secured Notes will not require us to take a number of actions to perfect or
to improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes, including control agreements with respect to deposit accounts and securities accounts.
Failure to create and perfect a security interest in the Collateral within the required time period and in
accordance with the requirements of the Notes Security Documents will constitute an Event of Default
(as defined below) if and to the extent provided under clauses (3) or (8) under the caption “—Events of
Default and Remedies” below. Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Trustee
and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes has any duty or responsibility to see to or monitor the
performance of the Company and its Subsidiaries with regard to these matters, or to perfect or
maintain the perfection of the security interest in the Collateral.

**Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement**

On the Issue Date, the Collateral Agent and the Trustee, on behalf of themselves and the Holders
of the Senior Secured Notes, and the administrative agent under the Senior Credit Agreement and the
Bank Collateral Agent, on behalf of themselves and the lenders under the Senior Credit Agreement,
will enter into the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, which will set forth the relative rights and
obligations of the holders of Equal Priority Obligations with respect to Shared Collateral. The Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement will be binding on the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes with
respect to the matters described below to the same extent that such provisions apply to the Collateral
Agent.

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the Applicable Collateral
Agent, acting at the direction of the Applicable Representative, has the right to initiate foreclosures and
take certain other actions with respect to the Shared Collateral and all Notes Security Documents to
the extent they relate to the Shared Collateral, and the Collateral Agent and the Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will have no right to direct the Applicable Collateral Agent to take actions with respect to
the Shared Collateral unless the Collateral Agent is the Applicable Collateral Agent pursuant to the
terms of the definition thereof. The “Applicable Representative” shall be the administrative agent under
the Senior Credit Agreement until the earlier of (i) the discharge of all indebtedness under the Senior
Credit Agreement and (ii) the Non-Controlling Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below)
and, thereafter, the Equal Priority Representative for the series of Equal Priority Obligations (other than
in respect of the Senior Credit Agreement) that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of
any then outstanding series of Equal Priority Obligations (other than in respect of the Senior Credit
Agreement) (such representative, the “Major Non-Controlling Representative”). The “Applicable
_Collateral Agent” shall be the Bank Collateral Agent until the earlier of (i) the discharge of all_
indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement and (ii) the Non-Controlling Representative
Enforcement Date and, thereafter, the collateral agent for the series of Equal Priority Obligations

113


-----

represented by the Major Non-Controlling Representative. The “Controlling Secured Parties” shall be
the Equal Priority Secured Parties for the series of Equal Priority Obligations represented by the
Applicable Representative. As of the Issue Date, the Applicable Representative will be the
administrative agent under the Senior Credit Agreement and the Applicable Collateral Agent will be the
Bank Collateral Agent.

Any representative that is not the Applicable Representative at such time is a “Non-Controlling
_Representative.” As of the Issue Date, the Trustee will be a Non-Controlling Representative._

The “Non-Controlling Representative Enforcement Date” will be, with respect to any
Non-Controlling Representative, the date which is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such
Non-Controlling Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Representative) after the occurrence of
both,

(a) an event of default (under and as defined in the definitive debt documentation under which
such Non-Controlling Representative is the Equal Priority Representative), and

(b) each collateral agent’s and each other representative’s receipt of written notice from such
Non-Controlling Representative certifying that,

(i) such Non-Controlling Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Representative and
that an event of default (under and as defined in the definitive debt documentation under which
such Non-Controlling Representative is the representative) has occurred and is continuing, and

(ii) the Equal Priority Obligations of the series with respect to which such Non-Controlling
Representative is the representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of
acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable definitive debt
documentation;

_provided that the Non-Controlling Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not_
occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred (1) at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent acting
on the instructions of the Applicable Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any
enforcement action with respect to the Shared Collateral, (2) at any time the Company or any
Guarantor that has granted a security interest in Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with
respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or (3) if the acceleration of
the Equal Priority Obligations of the series with respect to which such Non-Controlling Representative
(if any) is rescinded in accordance with the terms of the applicable definitive debt documentation.

Pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall have the sole right to act or refrain from acting with
respect to the Shared Collateral (including pursuant to any other intercreditor agreement relating to the
Shared Collateral);

(ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall act only on the instructions of the Applicable
Representative and shall not follow any instructions with respect to the Shared Collateral from any
Non-Controlling Representative or holders of Equal Priority Obligations (other than the Applicable
Representative); and

(iii) no Equal Priority Representative will instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to commence
any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver,
liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any
right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interests in or realize
upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (subject to customary
exceptions).

114


-----

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on any Shared Collateral, the Applicable Collateral
Agent may deal with the Collateral as if the Applicable Collateral Agent had a senior and exclusive Lien
on such Collateral (subject to the distribution provisions set forth below). No Equal Priority
Representative or Equal Priority Collateral Agent that is not the Applicable Collateral Agent may
contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral
Agent or any exercise by the Applicable Collateral Agent of any rights and remedies relating to the
Shared Collateral.

In addition, each Equal Priority Representative and each Equal Priority Secured Party will agree it
(i) will not challenge or question or support any other Person in challenging or questioning in any
proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) the validity or enforceability of any
Equal Priority Obligations of any series or any Equal Priority Document or the validity, attachment,
perfection or priority of any Lien under any Equal Priority Document or the validity or enforceability of
the priorities, rights or duties established by or other provisions of the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement, (ii) will not take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could
be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale,
transfer or other disposition of the Collateral by the Applicable Collateral Agent, (iii) except as
otherwise provided in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, shall have no right to and shall not
otherwise (A) direct the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party to
exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to any Shared Collateral (including pursuant to any
other intercreditor agreement) or (B) consent to, or object to, the exercise by, or any forbearance from
exercising by, the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party represented
thereby of any right, remedy or power with respect to any Shared Collateral, (iv) will not institute any
suit or assert in any suit, insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceeding any claim against the
Applicable Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party represented thereby seeking
damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to
any Shared Collateral, and (v) will not attempt, directly or indirectly, whether by judicial proceedings or
otherwise, to challenge the enforceability of any provision of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Distribution of Enforcement Proceeds_**

If an event of default (under and as defined in an instrument governing any series of Equal
Priority Obligations) has occurred and is continuing and the Applicable Collateral Agent is taking action
to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral and in connection therewith any distribution or
payment in respect of Shared Collateral is made, or any distribution is made in respect of any Shared
Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of any of the issuer or a Guarantor of Collateral,
or any Equal Priority Representative or any Equal Priority Secured Party receives any payment
pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement) with
respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation or disposition
of any such Shared Collateral received by such Equal Priority Representative or other Equal Priority
Secured Party and the proceeds of any such distribution shall be applied as follows pursuant to the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) first, to (A) the payment of all amounts owing to each Applicable Collateral Agent (in its
capacity as Equal Priority Representative (in its capacity as such)) secured by such Shared
Collateral or, in the case of any proceeds of any equity interests foreclosed upon where the
Applicable Collateral Agent releases its Lien on the assets of such Person on which another
series of Equal Priority Obligations holds a Lien on any of the assets of such Person (any such
assets, the “Underlying Assets”), secured by the Underlying Assets, including all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by each such Applicable Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such)
and each such Equal Priority Representative (in its capacity as such) in connection with the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement, any other any other Equal Priority Document or any of the Equal

115


-----

Priority Obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents
and legal counsel, and any other reasonable costs or expenses incurred in connection with the
exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Equal Priority Documents and all
fees and indemnities owing to such Applicable Collateral Agents and Equal Priority
Representatives, ratably to each such Applicable Collateral Agent and Equal Priority
Representative in accordance with the amounts payable to it pursuant to this clause first;

(ii) second, to the extent proceeds remain after the application pursuant to the preceding
clause first, to each Equal Priority Representative for the payment in full of the other Equal
Priority Obligations of each series secured by such Shared Collateral or, in the case of Equity
Release Proceeds (as defined below), secured by the Underlying Assets, and, if the amount of
such proceeds are insufficient to pay in full the Equal Priority Obligations of each series so
secured then such proceeds shall be allocated among the Equal Priority Representatives of each
series secured by such Shared Collateral or, in the case of Equity Release Proceeds, secured by
the Underlying Assets, pro rata according to the amounts of such Equal Priority Obligations owing
to each such respective Equal Priority Representative and the other Equal Priority Secured
Parties represented by it for distribution by such Equal Priority Representative in accordance with
its respective Equal Priority Documents; provided that following the commencement of any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the Company or any Guarantor, solely as
among the holders of Equal Priority Obligations and solely for purposes of this clause second and
not any other documents governing Equal Priority Obligations, in the event the value of the
Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of post-petition interest on the Equal
Priority Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any
other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or
liquidation proceeding, the amount of Equal Priority Obligations of each series of Equal Priority
Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest on the Equal Priority
Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other
applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or
liquidation proceeding; and

(iii) third, any balance of such proceeds remaining after the application pursuant to the
preceding clauses “first” and “second,” to the Company and the Guarantors, their successors or
assigns, or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations of any series that (i) the Equal Priority
Obligations of such series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other
obligations (other than a series of Equal Priority Obligations), (ii) the Equal Priority Obligations of such
series do not have a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other
series of Equal Priority Obligations, or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other
obligations (other than any other series of Equal Priority Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the
security interest of such series of Equal Priority Obligations but junior to the security interest of any
other series of Equal Priority Obligations (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clause (i), (ii),
or (iii) with respect to any series of Equal Priority Obligations, an “Impairment” of such series of Equal
Priority Obligations), the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such series
of Equal Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series of Equal Priority Obligations
(including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such series of Equal Priority
Obligations) under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary
so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of such series of Equal Priority
Obligations subject to such Impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Collateral
for which a third party (other than a holder of Equal Priority Obligations) has a Lien or security interest
that is junior in priority to the security interest of any series of Equal Priority Obligations but senior (as
determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of the
holder of any other series of Equal Priority Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the

116


-----

value of any Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted
on a ratable basis solely from the Collateral or proceeds to be distributed in respect of the series of
Equal Priority Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists.

**_Certain Agreements With Respect to Bankruptcy or Insolvency Proceedings_**

The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that it shall continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding by or against any of
the Company or a Guarantor.

If any of the Company or a Guarantor shall become subject to a bankruptcy case and seeks
approval of financing to be provided by one or more lenders or the use of cash collateral, each of the
Equal Priority Secured Parties (other than any Controlling Secured Party or Equal Priority
Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) agrees that it will raise no objection to any such
financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any
use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, in each case unless an Equal Priority
Representative of the Controlling Secured Parties shall then oppose or object to such financing or such
Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such financing Liens are senior to the Liens on
any such Shared Collateral, each other Equal Priority Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with
respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties
are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that the Liens in respect of such financing rank pari
passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral, each other Equal Priority Secured Party will
confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as (A) the Equal Priority Secured Parties retain the
benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral, including proceeds thereof arising after the
commencement of such bankruptcy case, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other Secured Parties
(other than any Liens of any Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as
existed prior to the commencement of such bankruptcy case, (B) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of
each series of Equal Priority Obligations are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any
Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such financing or
use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-à-vis the Equal Priority Secured Parties as set forth in
the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement (other than any Liens of any Equal Priority Secured Parties
constituting DIP Financing Liens), (C) if any amount of such financing or cash collateral is applied to
repay any of the Equal Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the provisions of the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, and (D) if any Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted
adequate protection with respect to Equal Priority Obligations subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such financing or use of
cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement. The foregoing is subject to (x) the right of the Equal Priority Secured Parties
to object to the grant of a Lien to secure any such financing over any collateral securing such series of
debt that is not Shared Collateral and (y) the Equal Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate
protection shall not object to any other Equal Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection
comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Equal Priority Secured Parties in connection
with any such financing or use of cash collateral.

**_Turnover_**

If any Equal Priority Representative obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any
proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral pursuant to any Security Document or
by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor
agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each series of Equal Priority Obligations, then such
Equal Priority Representative shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the

117


-----

other Equal Priority Secured Parties that have a security interest in such Shared Collateral and
promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Applicable
Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with “ —Distribution of Enforcement Proceeds” above.

**_Automatic Release of Liens_**

Upon any release, sale or disposition of Shared Collateral permitted pursuant to the terms of the
Senior Credit Agreement that results in the release of the Lien in respect of the Secured Credit
Facilities Obligations on any Shared Collateral (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
is pending at the time), the Lien in respect of Obligations under the Indenture and the Senior Secured
Notes on Shared Collateral shall automatically be released and discharged upon final conclusion of
such disposition as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Applicable Collateral Agent on
such Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared
Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied in accordance with “—Distribution of Enforcement
Proceeds” above.

If, at any time, the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies
against any Shared Collateral, in each case prior to the discharge of such series of Equal Priority
Obligations, the equity interests of any Person are foreclosed upon or otherwise disposed of and the
Applicable Collateral Agent releases its Lien on the property or assets of such Person constituting
Shared Collateral and/or releases the guarantees of the Equal Priority Obligations requested by the
Applicable Collateral Agent or such Person, then the Liens of each other Applicable Collateral Agent
(or in favor of such other Equal Priority Secured Parties if directly secured by such Liens) with respect
to any Collateral consisting of the property or assets of such Person constituting Shared Collateral will
be automatically released and discharged to the same extent as the Liens and guarantees in favor of
the Applicable Collateral Agent are released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any such
equity interests foreclosed upon where the Applicable Collateral Agent releases its Lien on the assets
of such Person on which another series of Equal Priority Obligations holds a Lien on Underlying
Assets, which Lien is released as provided in this sentence (any such proceeds being referred to
herein as “Equity Release Proceeds” regardless of whether or not such other series of Equal Priority
Obligations holds a Lien on such equity interests so disposed of) shall be applied as described in
“—Distribution of Enforcement Proceeds” above.

**Certain Covenants with Respect to the Collateral**

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents, which will contain provisions
relating to identification of the Collateral and the maintenance of perfected Liens thereon. The following
is a summary of some of the covenants and provisions set forth in the Security Documents and the
Indenture as they relate to the Collateral.

**_After-Acquired Property_**

Upon the acquisition by any of the Company or the Guarantors after the Issue Date of any assets
(other than Excluded Assets and exceptions based on immateriality thresholds of aggregate assets as
set forth in the Security Documents), the Company or such Guarantor shall execute and deliver, to the
extent required by the Indenture and/or the Security Documents, any information, documentation,
financing statements or other certificates and opinions of counsel as may be necessary to vest in the
Collateral Agent a perfected security interest, with the priority required by the Indenture and the
Security Documents, subject only to Permitted Liens, in such after-acquired property and to have such
after-acquired property added to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the Indenture and the
Security Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such after-acquired property
to the same extent and with the same force and effect.

118


-----

**_Further Assurances_**

To the extent required under the Indenture or any of the Security Documents or the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors shall execute any and all further
documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all further actions that may
be required under applicable Law, or that the Collateral Agent or the Trustee may reasonably request,
in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interests and
Liens created or intended to be created by the Security Documents in the Collateral. In addition, to the
extent required under the Indenture or any of the Security Documents, from time to time, the Company
and the Guarantors will reasonably promptly secure the obligations under the Indenture and Security
Documents by pledging or creating, or causing to be pledged or created, perfected security interests
and Liens with respect to the Collateral to the extent required by the Indenture and/or the Security
Documents.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

Neither Holdings, the Company nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will (i) take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action which would materially adversely affect or impair the Liens in favor
of the Collateral Agent, the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured Notes with respect to the
Collateral unless such action or failure to take action is otherwise permitted by the Indenture, the
Security Documents or the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) grant any Person, or permit
any Person to retain (other than the Collateral Agent), any Liens on the Collateral, other than Permitted
Liens. To the extent required under the Indenture or the Security Documents, the Company and each
Guarantor will, at its sole cost and expense, execute and deliver all such agreements and instruments
as necessary, or as the Trustee or the Collateral Agent reasonably requests, to more fully or accurately
describe the assets and property intended to be Collateral or the Obligations intended to be secured by
the Security Documents.

**_Negative Pledge_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company and each Guarantor will not, and the Company will
not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, further pledge the Collateral as security or otherwise,
subject to “—Certain Covenants—Liens” and Permitted Liens. The Company, however, subject to
compliance by the Company with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain
Covenants—Liens,” has the ability under the Indenture to issue an unlimited aggregate principal
amount of Additional Senior Secured Notes, all of which may be secured by the Collateral.

**Foreclosure**

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, but subject in all cases
to the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents will provide for
(among other available remedies) the sale of, enforcement against or other realization upon, the
applicable Collateral by the Collateral Agent and the distribution of the net proceeds of any such sale to
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (and other Secured Parties under the Indenture) and other
Equal Priority Debt on a pro rata basis, subject to any prior Liens on the Collateral and the provisions
of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of realization on the Collateral, the proceeds
from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy in full the Company’s obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes.

119


-----

**Certain Bankruptcy Limitations**

In addition to the limitations described above, the right of the Collateral Agent to obtain
possession, exercise control over or dispose of the Collateral following an Event of Default would be
significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate
arrangement, winding-up or similar laws if the Company or any Guarantor were to have become a
debtor under the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar law or statute under debtor relief, bankruptcy,
insolvency, corporate arrangement, winding-up or similar laws in any applicable jurisdiction) prior to the
Collateral Agent having obtained possession, exercised control over or disposed of the Collateral. For
example, upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor,
such as the Collateral Agent, is prohibited by the automatic stay from obtaining possession of its
collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from exercising control over or disposing of collateral
taken from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the
circumstances). Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code and other debtor relief, insolvency, corporate
arrangement or similar laws permit the debtor in certain circumstances to continue to retain and to use
collateral owned as of the date of the bankruptcy or insolvency filing (and the proceeds, products,
offspring, rents or profits of such collateral) even though the debtor is in default under the applicable
debt instruments, subject to certain protections that may be afforded to a secured creditor. In view of
the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as the lack of a precise definition of the
term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Senior
Secured Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of any
delay in making such payments), whether or when the Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of
the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or thereafter or whether
or to what extent holders of the Senior Secured Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment
or loss of value of the Collateral through adequate protection or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event a
bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any Equal Priority
Debt) is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the Indebtedness
evidenced by the Senior Secured Notes would be “undersecured” and the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes would only hold secured claims to the extent of the value of the Collateral and would
hold unsecured claims as to the difference. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual
of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy
case only to the extent the value of the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. In addition, the
Company or any Guarantor (or any trustee or similar official appointed therefor) or creditors of the
Company or any Guarantor may seek to challenge the grant of the Collateral to the Collateral Agent as
a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, preference, transfer at undervalue or otherwise under the
Bankruptcy Code and/or applicable state law. If such a challenge were successful, the Liens may be
avoided, leaving the holders of the Senior Secured Notes with unsecured claims against the applicable
entities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral—Any future pledge of Collateral or any
guarantee issued in favor of the holders of Notes might be avoidable in bankruptcy or otherwise.”

**Refinancings of the Senior Credit Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes**

The obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the obligations under the Indenture and
the Senior Secured Notes may be refinanced or replaced, in whole or in part, in each case, without
notice to, or the consent of the Bank Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent or the holder of any Notes
(except to the extent a consent is otherwise required to permit the refinancing transaction under the
Senior Credit Agreement or any security document related thereto or under the Indenture and the
Security Documents), all without affecting the Lien priorities provided for in the Security Documents;
_provided, however, that the lenders providing or holders of any such refinancing or replacement_
Indebtedness (or an authorized agent or trustee on their behalf) bind themselves in writing to the terms

120


-----

of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to a written agreement (including amendments
or supplements to the Intercreditor Agreement) as required by the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement.

In addition, if at any time in connection with or after the discharge of Secured Credit Facility
Obligations the Company enters into any replacement of the Senior Credit Agreement secured by all or
a portion of the Collateral on a first-priority Lien basis (subject to “—Certain Covenants—Liens” and
Permitted Liens), then such prior discharge of Senior Credit Facility Obligations shall automatically be
deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior
Credit Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents, and the Obligations under such
replacement Credit Agreement shall automatically be treated as Senior Credit Facility Obligations, for
all purposes of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities
and rights in respect of the Collateral (or such portion thereof) set forth therein. In connection with any
refinancing or replacement contemplated by the foregoing paragraphs, the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement may be amended at the request and sole expense of the Company, and without the
consent of the Bank Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent or the holder of any Notes, (a) to add parties
(or any authorized agent or trustee therefor) providing any such refinancing or replacement
indebtedness in compliance with the Senior Credit Agreement and the Indenture and (b) to establish
that Liens on any Collateral securing such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness shall have the
same priority (or junior priority) or, if the Senior Credit Agreement and the Indenture so permit, senior
priority, as the Liens on any Collateral securing the Indebtedness being refinanced or replaced, all on
the terms provided for in the Indenture and the Security Documents immediately prior to such
refinancing or replacement.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Company will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may
be required to offer to purchase Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders.” Holdings, the Company, the Investors and their respective Affiliates may, at their
discretion, at any time and from time to time acquire Senior Secured Notes in the open market, by
tender-offer, negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below or in the third paragraph under “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Change of Control,” the Company will not be entitled to redeem the Senior Secured Notes at
its option prior to, 2026.

At any time prior to, 2026, the Company may redeem all or a part of the Senior Secured
Notes, upon notice as described under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and
Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of redemption (any applicable date of redemption, the “Redemption Date”), subject
to the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date. Calculation of the Applicable Premium will be
made by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate;
_provided that such calculation or the correctness thereof shall not be a duty or obligation of the_
Trustee.

On and after, 2026, the Company may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in
part, upon notice as described under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,”

121


-----

at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the
applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date, if
redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2026 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %

In addition, until, 2026, the Company may, at its option, upon notice as described under
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,” on one or more occasions redeem up
to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes (including any Additional Senior
Secured Notes) issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to % of the aggregate
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the
applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date,
with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings to the
extent such net cash proceeds are received by or contributed to the Company; provided that (a) at
least 50% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes originally issued
under the Indenture on the Issue Date and any Additional Senior Secured Notes originally issued
under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each
such redemption and (b) each such redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of closing of each
such Equity Offering.

In addition, until, 2026, the Company may, at its option, upon notice as described under
the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,” on one or more occasions
redeem up to 10.0% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes during each 12-month
period commencing with the Issue Date (including any Additional Senior Secured Notes of the same
series) issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption
Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes,
if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the
Company, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the
Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or
such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not
more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem (with respect to the Company) or
purchase (with respect to a third party) all Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding following
such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such tender offer plus, to the
extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding, the Redemption Date or purchase date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to
the Redemption Date or purchase date.

Notice of any redemption or purchase of the Senior Secured Notes may, at the Company’s
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. If such redemption or purchase is subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if
applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the Redemption Date or purchase date may

122


-----

be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was
sent, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Redemption Date or the purchase date, or by the
Redemption Date or purchase date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the
Company’s discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Company any or all of such conditions will not
be satisfied. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or
purchase price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption or
purchase may be performed by another Person. In no event shall the Trustee be responsible for
monitoring, or charged with knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of the Senior Secured
Notes eligible under the Indenture to be redeemed.

The Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in the manner described under
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice.”

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless, prior to, or concurrently
with, the time the Company is required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined below), the
Company has previously or concurrently mailed or transmitted electronically a redemption notice with
respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or
“—Satisfaction and Discharge,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the
“Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling
on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control,
the Company will send written notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class
mail, with a copy to the Trustee, sent in the same manner, to each Holder to the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with
the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of
Control,” and that all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control
Offer will be accepted for payment by the Company;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days
nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is transmitted electronically or mailed (the “Change of
_Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance_
of a Change of Control as described below;

(3) that any Secured Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue
interest;

(4) that unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all
Senior Secured Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Senior Secured Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer will be required to surrender such Senior Secured Notes, with the form entitled “Option of

123


-----

Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Senior Secured Notes completed or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address
specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of
Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Senior Secured Notes and their
election to require the Company to purchase such Senior Secured Notes; provided that the paying
agent receives, not later than the expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile
transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Senior
Secured Notes and its election to have such Senior Secured Notes purchased and any other
information as may be required by the paying agent, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of
DTC;

(7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes are tendered for purchase, such
Holder will be issued new Senior Secured Notes and such new Senior Secured Notes will be equal in
principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered; provided that
the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof;

(8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change
of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control, and, if applicable, stating
that, in the Company’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time
as any or all applicable conditions shall be satisfied, or that such purchase may not occur and such
notice may be rescinded in the event that the Company shall determine that the Change of Control will
not occur by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so
delayed; and

(9) the other instructions, as determined by the Company, consistent with this covenant, that a
Holder must follow.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly
tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment
in respect of all Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Senior Secured Notes so
accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Senior Secured Notes or
portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Company.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable
in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in a Change of Control

124


-----

Offer and the Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as
described below, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such
Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Secured Notes that remain
outstanding to, but excluding, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the
Redemption Date).

The Senior Credit Agreement provides, and future credit agreements or other agreements
relating to Indebtedness to which the Company becomes a party may provide, that certain change of
control events with respect to Holdings and the Company would constitute a default thereunder
(including but not limited to a Change of Control under the Indenture or the Existing Notes Indenture). If
Holdings or the Company experiences a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior
Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement, Holdings or the Company could seek a waiver of such
default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement. In the event
Holdings and the Company do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Agreement and/
or such other agreement, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit
Agreement and/or such other agreement being declared due and payable.

The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control
may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior
Secured Notes—We may not be able to purchase the Senior Secured Notes upon a change of control,
which would result in a default under the Indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes and
would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain
circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of Holdings or the Company and,
thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of
negotiations between the initial purchasers and the Company.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, Holdings or the Company could enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect its capital structure or credit ratings.

Restrictions on the ability of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, including the Company, to incur
additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and
“—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent
of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except
for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants
or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the
Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements
set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and
purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control
Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in

125


-----

advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is
in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body
of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all”
of the assets of Holdings. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has
occurred and whether a Holder of Senior Secured Notes may require the Company to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of
“Change of Control,” may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

**_Asset Sales_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate, directly or
indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the
time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by Holdings
or the Company at the time of contractually agreeing to such sale) of the assets sold or otherwise
disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration for such
Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received
by Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries is in the form of Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this
covenant and for no other purpose, the following are deemed to be Cash Equivalents:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on Holdings’ or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent
balance sheet or in the notes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such
balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been shown on Holdings’ or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken
place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by Holdings or the
Company) of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms
subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes, that are assumed by the transferee of any such
assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset
Sale) and for which Holdings and all Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all
creditors in writing;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by Holdings or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary into
Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received) within 180 days following the
closing of such Asset Sale; and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Holdings or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $231.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA of the Company for the Applicable Measurement Period at the time of the receipt of such

126


-----

Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated
Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value.

Within 450 days after the later of (x) the date of any Asset Sale and (y) the receipt of such Net
Proceeds of any Asset Sale, Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net
Proceeds from such Asset Sale, in accordance with clauses (1) and (2) below, as applicable,

(1) to the extent that such Net Proceeds is from an Asset Sale of any Collateral,

(a) to permanently reduce:

(i) Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement or any other Equal Priority Obligations,
to the extent such Obligations were incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph under
“Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock” (and, in the case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto);

(ii) Senior Secured Notes Obligations or any other Equal Priority Obligations (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness) of the Company or any Guarantor (and, in the case of revolving
obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto, if applicable); provided
that if the Company or any Guarantor shall so repay any Equal Priority Obligations other than the
Senior Secured Notes, the Company will either (1) reduce Senior Secured Notes Obligations on a
pro rata basis by, at its option, (A) redeeming Senior Secured Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or any equivalent provision with respect to any Additional Senior
Secured Notes or (B) purchasing Senior Secured Notes through open-market purchases at a
purchase price not less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, or (2) make an offer (in
accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to
purchase their Senior Secured Notes on a ratable basis with such other Equal Priority Obligations
for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid
interest, if any, on the amount of Senior Secured Notes that would otherwise be repurchased
(which offer shall be deemed an Asset Sale Offer for purposes of the Indenture); or

(iii) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to Holdings or another Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) to make (i) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in
any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in Holdings or a Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it
constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) Capital Expenditures or
(iii) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (i), (ii) and (iii), either (x) are used or useful in a Similar
Business or (y) replace in whole or in part the businesses or assets that are the subject of such Asset
Sale; or

(c) any combination of the foregoing;

(2) to the extent that such Net Proceeds is from an Asset Sale of any assets not constituting
Collateral,

(a) to permanently reduce:

(i) Obligations under a Credit Facility to the extent such Obligations were incurred under
clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (and, in the case of
revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto);

127


-----

(ii) Senior Secured Notes Obligations or other Senior Indebtedness (and, in the case of
revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided
that, in the case of this clause (ii), the Company shall (1) equally and ratably reduce Senior
Secured Notes Obligations on a pro rata basis as provided under “—Optional Redemption,”
through open-market purchases at a purchase price not less than 100% of the principal amount
thereof or (2) by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset
Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Senior Secured Notes on a ratable basis with such
other Senior Indebtedness for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount
of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Senior Secured Notes that would
otherwise be repurchased (which offer shall be deemed an Asset Sale Offer for purposes of the
Indenture); or

(iii) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to Holdings or another Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) to make (i) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in
any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in Holdings or a Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it
constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) Capital Expenditures or
(iii) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (i), (ii) and (iii), either (x) are used or useful in a Similar
Business or (y) replace in whole or in part the businesses or assets that are the subject of such Asset
Sale; or

(c) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clauses (1)(b) and (2)(b) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as_
a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as Holdings or
such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net
Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within the later of (x) 180 days of such
commitment and (y) 450 days after the date of the applicable Asset Sale (an “Acceptable
_Commitment”); and in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any_
reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds shall
constitute Excess Proceeds after the later of (A) 450 days after the date of the applicable Asset Sale
and (B) the termination of such Acceptable Commitment (unless another Acceptable Commitment is
entered into with respect thereto prior to such later date).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sales
by an Exempt Entity would have a material adverse tax consequence to Holdings, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with
such repatriation or expatriation) or is prohibited or subject to limitation by applicable local law, order,
decree or determination of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority from being repatriated or
expatriated to the United States or distributed to the Company or any Guarantor that is not an Exempt
Entity, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with
this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Exempt Entity so long, but only so
long, as applicable, as such material adverse tax consequence exists or the applicable local law will not
permit repatriation or expatriation to the United States or distribution to the Company or any Guarantor
(Holdings and the Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Exempt
Entity to take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational
impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation, expatriation or distribution), and if such
repatriation or expatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds, as applicable, no longer has material
adverse tax consequences or is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation or expatriation
will be promptly effected and such repatriated or expatriated Net Proceeds will be applied (whether or not
repatriation or expatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant.

128


-----

Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the
time period set forth in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When
the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds an aggregate of the greater of (i) $70.0 million and
(ii) 7.5% of Consolidated EBITDA in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Company
shall make an offer to all Holders and, if and to the extent required by the terms of any Equal Priority
Obligations, to the holders of such Equal Priority Obligations (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the
maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Senior Secured Notes
and such Equal Priority Obligations that is in a minimum amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased in the amount equal to the sum of the Excess
Proceeds (the “Excess Proceeds Payment Amount”) at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to
100% of the principal amount or accreted value thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Equal Priority Obligations.
The Company will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by
sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement, with a copy to the Trustee in the case of the Indenture. The Company may satisfy the
foregoing obligation with respect to such Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale
Offer with respect to all or a portion of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance
of being required to do so by the Indenture (the “Advance Offer”).

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Senior
Secured Notes and, if applicable, Equal Priority Obligations tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer
is less than the Excess Proceeds Payment Amount (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance
Portion), the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer,
the Advance Portion) for such amount offered in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Senior Secured Notes or the Equal
Priority Obligations surrendered by such Holders and holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall select the
Senior Secured Notes and such Equal Priority Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis based
on the principal amount or accreted value of the Senior Secured Notes or such Equal Priority
Obligations tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Senior Secured Notes or Equal Priority
Obligations, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon
completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero, but in
the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Proceeds the Company is offering to apply in such
Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. Additionally, upon
consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed
Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited under the Indenture.

Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant,
the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness
outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Agreement) or otherwise
invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Holder of any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds may apply any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds in any
manner not prohibited by the Indenture and such Retained Asset Sale Proceeds shall in no event and
under no circumstances constitute Excess Proceeds.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable
in connection with each repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the

129


-----

extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If the Company is redeeming less than all of the Senior Secured Notes or if the Company is
repurchasing less than all of the Senior Secured Notes tendered for purchase, and the Senior Secured
Notes are global Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed or repurchased will
be selected by DTC in accordance with applicable DTC procedures. If the Senior Secured Notes to be
redeemed or repurchased are not global Senior Secured Notes then held by DTC, the Trustee will
select the Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed or repurchased (i) if the Senior Secured Notes are
listed on any national securities exchange and the Trustee has been notified by the Company of such
listing, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the
Senior Secured Notes are listed, (ii) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable or (iii) to the extent
that selection on a pro rata basis is not practicable, by lot or such other method as it shall deem fair
and appropriate (in accordance with the procedures of DTC, if applicable).

Notices of redemption or purchase shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the purchase or redemption date to
each Holder of Senior Secured Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance
with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be sent more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or
a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Secured Note is to be redeemed or purchased in
part only, any notice of redemption or purchase that relates to such Secured Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be redeemed or repurchased.

The Company will issue a new Secured Note (or cause to be transferred by book entry) in a
principal amount equal to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion of the original Secured Note in the
name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Secured Note; provided new Senior Secured
Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof. Senior Secured Notes called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed
for redemption or purchase, unless such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a
future event. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults or such redemption is
subject to one or more conditions precedent and such redemption has been rescinded or delayed,
interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants to be contained in the Indenture.

**_Effectiveness of Covenants_**

If (i) the Senior Secured Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from both Rating Agencies and
(ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension
_Event”), Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants_
(collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

130


-----

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock”;

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All
Assets”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Additional Secured Note Guarantees.”

In the event that Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any
subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment
Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Senior Secured Notes below an Investment
Grade Rating, then Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the
Suspended Covenants with respect to future events. Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants
may be reinstated, no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under
the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants,
and neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events
occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual
obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended
Covenants during the Suspension Period (or upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that
time based solely on events that occurred during the Suspension Period solely to the extent arising
from the failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period).

The period of time from and including the date of the Covenant Suspension Event to (and
excluding) the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” Additionally,
upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset
at zero. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by Holdings or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of
Default under the Indenture with respect to the Senior Secured Notes; provided that (1) with respect to
Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments made
will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during the Suspension Period, (2) all Indebtedness
incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be
classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,”
(3) any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement
entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” and (4) any
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take
any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective
during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the exception
to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.” No Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries
during any Suspension Period.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain
Investment Grade Ratings.

131


-----

The Company shall promptly provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the
occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date. The Trustee shall provide a copy of
such Officer’s Certificate to any Holder upon request. The Trustee will have no obligation to
(i) independently determine or verify if such events have occurred, (ii) make any determination
regarding the impact of actions taken during the Suspension Period on Holdings’ and its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ future compliance with their covenants or (iii) notify the Holders of any Covenant
Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(I) pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of Holdings’ or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection
with any merger, consolidation or amalgamation, other than:

(a) dividends, payments or distributions by Holdings payable solely in Equity Interests
(other than Disqualified Stock) of Holdings or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such
Equity Interests; or

(b) dividends, payments or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case
of any dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of

(30) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred by Holdings or any of its

(32) all premiums (if any), interest (including post-petition interest), dividends, fees, expenses,
charges and additional or contingent interest on obligations described in clauses (1) through (31)

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (32) of the preceding paragraph
or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Holdings or the Company,
in its sole discretion, may divide, classify or reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock (or portion thereof) or Preferred Stock (or portion thereof) in one of the above clauses or
paragraph;

(2) at the time of incurrence, Holdings or the Company will be entitled to divide and classify an
item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second
paragraphs above; and

(3) the principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding under any clause of this covenant shall be
determined after giving effect to the application of proceeds of any such Indebtedness to refinance any
such other Indebtedness.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness originally incurred
in reliance upon a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the Consolidated Secured
Debt Ratio under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant is being refinanced under such
clause (1) and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness thereunder to be
exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such
additional Indebtedness will be deemed to have been incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under
such clause (1) so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of Indebtedness being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence. Any
Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1) or (12)(b) above
shall be permitted to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to
pay accrued but unpaid interest and dividends and premiums (including reasonable tender premiums)
thereon, and defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing.

146


-----

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the
incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated
in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of
revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
(i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of
accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs,
underwriting discounts, and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
incurred in connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in
a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that
is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will provide that Holdings will not, and will not permit the Company or any
Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of
the Company or any Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee to the
extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the
Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be.

The Indenture will not treat (1) Indebtedness that is unsecured as subordinated or junior to
Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured and (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior
to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral.

**_Liens_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit the Company or any other Guarantor to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness on
any asset or property of Holdings, the Company or any other Guarantor, or any income or profits
therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless:

(1) in the case of Liens on any Collateral, such Lien is a Permitted Lien; or

(2) in the case of Liens on any other asset not constituting Collateral, either (i) such Lien is a
Permitted Lien or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes and related Guarantees are equally and ratably
secured by a Lien (or on a senior basis if such Lien secures Subordinated Indebtedness) on such
property, assets or proceeds with such Liens.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide
by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon
the release and discharge of the applicable Lien described in clause (2) in the paragraph above.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

Neither Holdings nor the Company will merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or wind up
into (whether or not it is the surviving entity), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise

147


-----

dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets (determined on a consolidated basis), in one
or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) Holdings or the Company, as applicable, is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or
surviving any such merger, consolidation or amalgamation (if other than Holdings or the Company, as
applicable) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will
have been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (Holdings, the Company or such Person, as
the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”); provided that in the case where the
Successor Company is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Senior Secured Notes is a corporation;

(2) the Successor Company, if other than Holdings or the Company, as applicable, expressly
assumes all the obligations of Holdings or the Company, as applicable under the Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement as the
case may be, pursuant to a supplemental indenture or joinders to the applicable Notes Security
Documents or the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement;

(3) immediately after such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
Obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such
transaction as having been incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the
time of such transaction), no Event of Default exists;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing
transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Measurement
Period,

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio
test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” or

(b) (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would be equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction or (ii) the
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would
be equal to or less than the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) if the Company is not the Successor Company, each Guarantor, unless it is the other party
to the transactions described above, in which case the third succeeding paragraph shall apply, shall
have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations
under the Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes;

(6) the Successor Company shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, sale, assignment transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition and such supplemental
indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture; and

(7) to the extent any assets of the Person who is merged, consolidated or amalgamated with or
into the Successor Company are assets of the type that would constitute Collateral under the Notes
Security Documents, the Successor Company will take such action as may be reasonably necessary to
cause such property and assets to be made subject to the Lien of the applicable Notes Security
Documents in the manner and to the extent required in the Indenture or the applicable Notes Security

148


-----

Documents and shall take all reasonably necessary action so that such Lien is perfected to the extent
required by the applicable Notes Security Documents.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, Holdings or the Company, as
the case may be, under the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Security Documents and
the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, and Holdings or the Company, as the case
may be, will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture, the
Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement,
as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4),

(1) Holdings or the Company may consolidate with or merge into or sell, assign, transfer, lease,
convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or a Guarantor;

(2) Any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Company) may consolidate with or merge into or
sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

(3) Holdings or the Company may consolidate, amalgamate or merge with an Affiliate thereof,
solely for the purpose of reincorporating Holdings or the Company, as applicable, in the United States,
any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof so long as the amount of
Indebtedness of Holdings, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

This “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” will not apply to a sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with a Receivables Facility.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents
governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale, disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor
(other than Holdings) will, and Holdings will not permit any such Guarantor to, consolidate or merge
with or into or wind up into (whether or not Holdings or such Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell,
assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets,
in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such
merger, consolidation or amalgamation (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a Person
organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, as the case
may be, or the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory
thereof (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor
_Person”);_

(b) the Successor Person, if other than such Guarantor, expressly assumes all the
obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Security
Documents and the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement as the case may be, pursuant to a
supplemental indenture or joinders to the applicable Notes Security Documents or the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) to the extent any assets of the Person who is merged, consolidated or amalgamated
with or into the Successor Company are assets of the type that would constitute Collateral under
the Notes Security Documents, the Successor Company will take such action as may be
reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to be made subject to the Lien of the
applicable Notes Security Documents in the manner and to the extent required in the Indenture or

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and if any such

owner of the Senior Secured Notes, securities analysts providing analysis of investment in the Senior
Secured Notes and market makers, in each case by posting such information on its website, on

acknowledgment, and will make such information readily available to any Holder, beneficial owners of
Senior Secured Notes, any prospective investor in the Senior Secured Notes, any securities analyst (to
the extent providing analysis of investment in the Senior Secured Notes) or any market maker in the
Senior Secured Notes who agrees to treat such information as confidential or accesses such
information on Intralinks or any comparable password-protected online data system which will require a
confidentiality acknowledgment; provided that the Company shall post such information thereon and
make readily available any password or other login information to any such Holder, beneficial owner of
Senior Secured Notes, prospective investor, securities analyst or market maker; provided, further,
_however, the Company may deny access to any competitively-sensitive information otherwise to be_
provided pursuant to this paragraph to any such Holder, prospective investor, security analyst or
market maker that is a competitor of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Company
determines in good faith that the provision of such information to such Person would be competitively
harmful to the Company and its Subsidiaries; and provided, still further, that such Holders, prospective
investors, security analysts or market makers shall agree to (i) treat all such reports (and the
information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the
information contained therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the
Senior Secured Notes (but shall be authorized to trade the Company’s securities) and (iii) not publicly
disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein). The Company will hold a quarterly
conference call for all Holders and securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of investment in

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company shall furnish to prospective
investors, upon their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the
Securities Act.

The Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this “—Reports and Other
Information” covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Company by furnishing
financial information relating to any Parent Entity of the Company instead of the Company; provided
that to the extent financial information related to such Parent Entity is provided, such information is
accompanied by consolidating information, which may be unaudited, that explains in reasonable detail
the differences between the information of such Parent Entity, on the one hand, and the information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand.

The Company will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to clauses (1) and (2) of the
first paragraph of this covenant if the Company or any Parent Entity of the Company has filed reports
containing such information with the SEC.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section
“—Reports and Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Company will be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default or Event of
Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Company or any Parent Entity of the Company
has made a good faith determination to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an
initial public offering of such entity’s Capital Stock, the Company will not be required to disclose any
information or take any actions that, in the good faith view of the Company, would violate applicable
securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules.

158


-----

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial statements, other information and
documents required to be provided by this covenant shall be, rather than those of the Company, those
of Holdings if Holdings and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries; such
Subsidiaries at Holdings being referred to as “Holdings’ Subsidiaries”) conduct, transact or otherwise
engage, or commit to conduct, transact or engage, in any business or operation, other than its direct
and indirect ownership of all of the Capital Stock in, and its management of, the Company and
operations incidental thereto); provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to
Holdings, such information is accompanied by consolidating information, which may be unaudited, that
explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information of the Company and the
Company’s Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the information relating to Holdings and Holdings’
Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand. To the extent financial information, including
any financial statements, of Holdings are substituted for those of the Company in reliance on the
foregoing sentence, the references in the Indenture to any financial statements of the Company shall
be deemed to refer to the financial statements of Holdings.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall be for informational
purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any
information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the
Company’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes (as
to which the Trustee shall have no duty to monitor and shall be entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s
Certificates). Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a
continuing basis or otherwise, the Company’s compliance with the covenants or with respect to any
reports or other documents filed with the SEC or participate in any conference calls.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given
(a) to the Company (with a copy to the Trustee) by the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes or (b) to the Company by the Trustee
to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in
clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or the Notes Security
Documents; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described
under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” such period of continuance of such
default or breach shall be 120 days after receipt of such written notice;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which
there is evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary
other than any Receivables Subsidiary or the payment of which is guaranteed by Holdings or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary or
pursuant to any Receivables Facility), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is
created after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at
its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an

159


-----

obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final
maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to
become due prior to its stated final maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, is
in the aggregate equal to $100.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent);

(5) failure by Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that taken together as of the date of the most recent audited financial statements of
Holdings would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
$100.0 million (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by insurance companies), which
final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after
such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an
enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is
not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Holdings, the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary;

(7) the Guarantee of Holdings or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of
Subsidiary Guarantors that taken together as of the date of the most recent audited financial
statements of Holdings would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason (except as
contemplated by the express terms thereof or the Indenture) cease to be in full force and effect or be
declared null and void or any responsible officer of such Guarantor (or the responsible officers of any
group of Subsidiary Guarantors that taken together as of the date of the most recent audited financial
statements of Holdings would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing
that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by
reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the
Indenture;

(8) the Liens created by the Notes Security Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid
and perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless
perfection is not required by the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents) other than (A) in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Security Document and the Indenture, (B) the
satisfaction in full of all Obligations under the Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results from
the failure of the Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates delivered to it representing
securities pledged under the Notes Security Documents and (ii) such default continues for 30 days
after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes; or

(9) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of
Subsidiary Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements
for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert,
in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Notes Security
Document is invalid or unenforceable.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing under the Indenture, the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Company and Trustee, or the Trustee by
written notice to the Company, may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other
monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable
immediately.

160


-----

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable
immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause
(6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Senior Secured Notes will become due and
payable immediately without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs
and is continuing and is actually known to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee must send
to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it is actually known to a responsible officer of
the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any
continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it
in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Trustee and the
Company may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Senior Secured Notes waive any existing Default or
Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment
of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder
(including in connection with an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control Offer)) and rescind any
acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, provided such rescission
would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of
Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding
any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes) shall
be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders,
if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose the Company delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the
Trustee stating that:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged; or

(2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as
the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent
will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee and the Collateral
Agent, as applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as
applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior
Secured Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and
the offer of security or indemnity; and

161


-----

(5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

In addition, as described above under the caption “—Security,” the exercise of remedies with
respect to the Collateral is subject to the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder for the enforcement of
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Holder’s Secured Note on or after the
respective due date expressed in such Secured Note.

Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the total outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or Collateral Agent or of exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee and Collateral Agent. The Trustee and Collateral Agent,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or the Notes
Security Documents, as applicable, or that the Trustee or Collateral Agent determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder (it being understood that the Trustee and Collateral Agent
does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such direction is unduly prejudicial to
such Holders) or that would involve the Trustee or Collateral Agent in personal liability.

The Indenture will provide that the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a
statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required, within 30 days, upon
becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default, its status
and the actions that the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

Any notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to
the Trustee or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default or Event of Default,
notice of acceleration or other notice to take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by
any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation
from each such Holder of Senior Secured Notes delivered to the Company, the Trustee and the
Collateral Agent, as applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC, or its
nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to
such Holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the
case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to
exist or the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the
time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other
information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy
of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification
_Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC, or its nominee, any Position Representation or_
Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Senior
Secured Notes in lieu of DTC, or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such
Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the
Collateral Agent, as applicable.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing
Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee
and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated
litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at
such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be

162


-----

automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically
reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee and the Collateral
Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its
Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and
the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder
Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such
Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s
participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such
Holder, the percentage of Senior Secured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such
Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such
Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity or security such Directing Holder
may have offered the Trustee or the Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall
be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as
applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such
Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder
Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as
the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing
paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall
have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce
compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered
to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative
Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise.
Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall have any liability to the Company, any Holder or any
other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Incorporators, Members,**
**Partners and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or stockholder of the Company or
any Guarantor or any of their parent companies or entities (other than the Company in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes and each Guarantor in respect of its Guarantee) shall have any liability for any
obligations of the Company or the Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees, the
Indenture, the Notes Security Documents or the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a
Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the federal securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Senior Secured
Notes, the applicable Notes Security Documents and the Guarantees will terminate (other than certain
obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Senior Secured Notes. The Company
may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes and the applicable Notes Security Documents and have each Guarantor’s
obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee, and have the Liens on the Collateral securing the

163


-----

Senior Secured Notes Obligations terminated and released (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then
existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on the Senior Secured Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created
pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Company’s obligations with respect to Senior Secured Notes concerning issuing
temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of such Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, and
the Company’s obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and
those of each Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are
described in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Notes Security
Documents, as applicable (“Covenant Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such
obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.
In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership,
rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Company) described under “—Events of Default
and Remedies” will no longer constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes:

(1) the Company or any Guarantor must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, Government
Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any
reinvestment of interest to pay the principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest due on the Senior
Secured Notes to the date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if
any, or interest on such Senior Secured Notes and the Company must specify whether such Senior
Secured Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular Redemption Date; provided that upon
any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be
sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal
to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of
the applicable Redemption Date (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to
be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date. Any Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the
deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be
applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, Holdings or the Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) Holdings or the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or

164


-----

(b) since the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, there has been a change in the
applicable U.S. federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners will not recognize income, gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, Holdings or the Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the
beneficial owners will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case the
granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of,
or constitute a default under any material agreement or material instrument (other than the Indenture)
to which, the Company or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Company or any Guarantor is
bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any
similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of
Liens in connection therewith);

(6) Holdings or the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating
that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or
defrauding any creditors of the Company or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) Holdings or the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and
exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance
or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

Upon a Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Trustee will advise the Collateral Agent that the Senior Secured Notes will cease to
constitute “Equal Priority Obligations” (or such similar term) under the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released, as provided under the caption
“—Security—Release of Collateral,” upon a Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance in accordance
with the provisions described above.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged (other than certain obligations to the Trustee and Collateral
Agent that expressly survive pursuant to the Indenture) and will cease to be of further effect as to all

165


-----

Senior Secured Notes and the Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, the
Indenture and the Guarantees will terminate and be released, when either:

(1) all Senior Secured Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or
destroyed Senior Secured Notes which have been replaced or paid and Senior Secured Notes for
whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Senior Secured Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have
become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become
due and payable within one year or may be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the
expense, of the Company and the Company or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to
be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S.
dollars, Government Securities or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the
Senior Secured Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if
any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption; provided that upon any redemption
that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for
purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the
Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium
Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date.
Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee
simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (b) the Company has paid or caused to be
paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and (c) the Company has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Secured
Notes at maturity or the Redemption Date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Company must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which
Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

Upon satisfaction and discharge in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee
will advise the Collateral Agent that it will cease to be a party to the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement on behalf of the Holders, and the Senior Secured Notes will cease to constitute “Equal
Priority Obligations” (or such similar term) under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released, as provided under the caption
“—Security—Release of Collateral,” upon the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture in
accordance with the provisions described above.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, any Guarantee, the
Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Security Documents or the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement
may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, other than Senior Secured Notes beneficially
owned by Holdings or its Affiliates (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, the Senior Secured Notes), and any existing Default or Event of
Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes
Security Documents or the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement issued thereunder may be waived
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes

166


-----

then outstanding, other than Senior Secured Notes beneficially owned by Holdings or its Affiliates
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the
Senior Secured Notes).

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder, an amendment or
waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes
whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Secured Note or reduce
the premium payable upon the redemption of such Senior Secured Notes or change the date at which
such Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed as described under “—Optional Redemption”; provided
that any amendment to the minimum notice requirement may be made with the consent of the Holders
of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Secured Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on the Senior Secured Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in respect of a
covenant or provision contained in the Indenture or any Guarantee which cannot be amended or
modified without the consent of all affected Holders;

(5) make any Secured Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or
the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Senior
Secured Notes;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions (except pursuant to the
second succeeding paragraph, which relates to amendments permitted without the consent of any
Holders);

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes
of any Holder to institute suit for enforcement of any payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest
on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of the Senior Secured Notes that would adversely
affect the Holders; or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantee of Holdings or any
Significant Subsidiary in any manner adverse in any material respect to the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% in
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver
may (A) make any change in any Notes Security Document, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement
or the provisions in the Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the
Collateral with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure
the Senior Secured Notes Obligations or (B) change or alter the priority of Liens securing the Senior
Secured Notes Obligations in any material portion of the Collateral in any way materially adverse,
taken as a whole, to the Holders, other than, in each case, as provided under the terms of the
Indenture, the Notes Security Documents or the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or
the Indenture to which it is a party) may (i) together with the Trustee, amend or supplement the

167


-----

Indenture, any Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes, and (ii) together with the Collateral Agent, amend
or supplement any Notes Security Document or the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, in each
case, without the consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency, as set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated
Senior Secured Notes;

(3) to comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation
or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Company’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the
Holders;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders
(including to secure the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees) or that does not adversely affect the
legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder in any material respect;

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred
upon the Company or any Guarantor;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture;

(8) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the
Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if applicable;

(9) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a
successor Trustee, Collateral Agent or a successor paying agent thereunder pursuant to the
requirements thereof;

(10) to provide for the issuance of exchange notes or private exchange notes, which are
identical to exchange notes except that they are not freely transferable;

(11) to add a Guarantor or a Guarantee of a Parent Entity of Holdings or the Company under
the Indenture, or to release any such Guarantor or Guarantee if at the time of such release such
Guarantor is not otherwise required by the Indenture to be a Guarantor;

(12) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes
Security Documents or the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, to any provision of
this “Description of Senior Secured Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of
Senior Secured Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the
Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees, the Notes Security Documents or the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, as set forth in an Officer’s Certificate;

(13) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(14) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to

conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing thereunder, written notice of which has been delivered to the Trustee or

satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent assumes any responsibility for the accuracy or
completeness of the information concerning Holdings or its affiliates or any other party contained in this

169


-----

and may affect the significance or accuracy of such information. Neither the Trustee nor any paying
agent shall be responsible for determining whether any Asset Sale has occurred or any Asset Sale
Offer with respect to the Senior Secured Notes is required, and whether any Change of Control has
occurred or whether any Change of Control Offer with respect to the Senior Secured Notes is required.
None of the Trustee, the Collateral Agent or any paying agent shall be responsible for monitoring the
Company’s rating status, making any request upon any Rating Agency, or determining whether any
rating event with respect to the Senior Secured Notes has occurred. The Trustee will have no duty to
take notice of any Event of Default, Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date, unless specifically
notified in a writing stating that such an event has occurred and describing the circumstances thereof.

The Indenture will provide that neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible
for the existence, genuineness, value or protection of any Collateral (except for the safe custody of
Collateral in its possession and for trust monies actually received), for the legality, effectiveness or
sufficiency of any Notes Security Document, or for the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or
protection of any Lien on Collateral.

Each Holder, by acceptance of the benefits of the Notes Security Documents, hereby irrevocably
agrees that the Collateral Agent may, without any further consent of any Holder, enter into any
intercreditor agreement (i) with the collateral agent or other representatives of holders of Indebtedness
secured by Liens permitted by clause (35) of “Permitted Liens” or Refinancing Indebtedness that is
intended to be secured on a pari passu basis with the Liens securing the Obligations and/or (ii) with the
collateral agent or other representatives of the holders of Indebtedness secured by Liens permitted by
clause (35) of “Permitted Liens” or Refinancing Indebtedness that is intended to be secured on a junior
basis to the Liens securing the Obligations, in each case, to the extent contemplated hereby and where
such Indebtedness is secured by Permitted Liens. The Collateral Agent may rely exclusively on a
certificate of a responsible officer of the Issuer as to whether any such other Liens are permitted. Any
such intercreditor agreement entered into by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement shall be binding on the Secured Parties.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees, the Notes Security Documents and
the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York.

The Indenture will provide that the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee irrevocably waive,
and each Holder of a Secured Note by its acceptance thereof irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or
relating to the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or any transaction contemplated thereby.

**Certain Definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the Indenture. For purposes of the Indenture,
unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term “consolidated” with respect to any Person refers to
such Person on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, but excluding from such consolidation
any Unrestricted Subsidiary as if such Unrestricted Subsidiary were not an Affiliate of such Person.

“Acquired Indebtedness” means, with respect to any specified Person,

consolidating or amalgamating with or into or becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of such specified
Person, and

(2) Indebtedness secured by a Lien encumbering any asset acquired by such specified Person.

“Affiliate” of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or

this definition, “control” (including, with correlative meanings, the terms “controlling,” “controlled by” and

each case in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket
or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of Holdings or the Company (which
election may be made on the date of such acquisition), be the date the definitive agreements for such
Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such
_pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set_
forth in the definition of “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” after giving effect to such Limited Condition
Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the
applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition
Acquisition, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (a) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a
result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of
the Company or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed
to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the
Limited Condition Acquisition and the related transactions to be entered into are permitted hereunder
and (b) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited
Condition Acquisition or related transactions; provided that (i) if any ratios improve or baskets increase
as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios or baskets may be utilized and (ii) if Holdings or
the Company elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive
agreement, any such transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the
date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition unless
and until such Limited Condition Acquisition has been abandoned, as determined by Holdings or the
Company, prior to the consummation thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, if Holdings or the Company
has exercised its option under the second sentence of this definition and any Default or Event of
Default occurs following the date on which the definitive acquisition agreements for the applicable
Limited Condition Acquisition were entered into and prior to or on the date of the consummation of
such Limited Condition Acquisition, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have
occurred or be continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection
with such Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted under the Indenture.

(other than solely any Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated); provided that

Limitation on Restricted Payments”; and

(2) each of (a) the Subsidiary to be so designated and (b) its Subsidiaries has not at the time of

Holdings or the Company may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that, immediately after giving effect to such designation, no Event of Default shall

“Voting Stock” of any Person as of any date means the Capital Stock of such Person that is at the
time generally entitled, without regard to contingencies, to vote in the election of the Board of such
Person. To the extent that a partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or other
agreement governing a partnership or limited liability company provides that the members of the Board
of such partnership or limited liability company (or, in the case of a limited partnership whose business
and affairs are managed or controlled by its general partner, the Board of the general partner of such
limited partnership) is appointed or designated by one or more Persons rather than by a vote of Voting
Stock, each of the Persons who are entitled to appoint or designate the members of such Board will be

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The Senior Secured Notes are being offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance
on Rule 144A (each, a “Rule 144A Note”). The Senior Secured Notes also may be offered and sold in
offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, the
Senior Secured Notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of $2,000
and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by
global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Restricted Global
Notes”). Regulation S Notes initially will be represented by temporary global notes in registered, global
form without interest coupons (each, a “Temporary Regulation S Global Note”). Each Temporary
Regulation S Global Note will be exchangeable for a single permanent note in registered, global form
(each, a “Permanent Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global
Notes, a “Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Restricted Global Notes, the “Global
Notes”) after the expiration the “distribution compliance period” (as defined in Regulation S). Prior to
such time, a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Restricted Global Note only upon receipt by
the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made to
a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer, or QIB, in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global
Note whether before, on or after such time, only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification to
the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S. The Global Notes will be
deposited upon issuance with the Trustee, as custodian for The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”),
and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a direct or
indirect participant in DTC as described below.

The Global Notes (and any notes issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain
restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Indenture and will bear the legend regarding such
restrictions set forth under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.” Subject to such restrictions, QIBs or
non-U.S. purchasers may elect to take physical delivery of a Certificated Security (as defined below
under “Certificated Securities”) instead of holding their interests through the Global Notes, which
certificated notes will be ineligible to trade through DTC (collectively referred to as the “Non-Global
Purchasers”) only in the limited circumstances described below. Upon the transfer to a QIB of any
Certificated Security initially issued to a Non-Global Purchaser, such Certificated Security will, unless
the transferee requests otherwise or the Global Notes have previously been exchanged in whole for
Certificated Securities, be exchanged for an interest in the Global Notes. For a description of the
restrictions on transfer of Certificated Securities and any interest in the Global Notes, see “Transfer
Restrictions.”

**The Global Notes**

We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global
Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the
individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons
who have accounts with such depositary (“Participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through,
records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of Participants) and the records of
Participants (with respect to interests of persons other than Participants). Such accounts initially will be
designated by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global
Notes will be limited to Participants or persons who hold interests through Participants. Holders may
hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are Participants in such system, or
indirectly through organizations that are Participants in such system.

211


-----

So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the Global Notes, DTC or
such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes
represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. No beneficial owner of an
interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s
procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture with respect to the notes. Any notices
required to be given to the holders while the notes are Global Notes will be given to DTC.

Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if
any) on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered
owner thereof. None of the Company, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such
beneficial ownership interest.

We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if
any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on the Global Notes, will credit Participants’
accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal
amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that
payments by Participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such
Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with
securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers.
Such payments will be the responsibility of such Participants.

Transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s
same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder
requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in
states that require physical delivery of the Senior Secured Notes, or to pledge such securities, such
holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC
and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes
(including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or
more Participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in
respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such Participant or
Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the
Indenture, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its
Participants and which include a legend as set forth under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.”

DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New
York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member
of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform
Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity,
corporate and municipal debt issues that Participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the posttrade settlement among Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities
through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Participants’ accounts.
This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S.
and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain
other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect Participants such as both
U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly.

212


-----

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in
the Global Notes among Participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and
such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of the Company, the Trustee or any paying
agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its Participants or indirect Participants
of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated Securities**

A beneficial interest in a Global Note is exchangeable for certificated Notes in fully registered
form without interest coupons (“Certificated Securities”) only in the following limited circumstances:

   - DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Note and
we fail to appoint a successor depositary within 90 days of such notice,

   - if the Company elects to issue Certificated Securities, or

   - there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes under the Indenture and DTC shall have requested the issuance of Certificated
Securities.

Certificated Securities may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless
the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” In no event shall the Regulation S Global Note be exchanged for
Certificated Securities prior to (a) the expiration of the distribution compliance period and (b) the receipt
of any certificates required under the provisions of Regulation S.

The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of
securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer the Senior Secured Notes will be limited
to such extent.

**Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Restricted Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period, beneficial interests in the Regulation
S Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to
Rule 144A; and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that the Senior Secured Notes are being transferred to a person:

(a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and
other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the
distribution compliance period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in
the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available).

213


-----

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and
the Restricted Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the
Trustee through the DTC deposit/withdrawal at custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any
such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted
Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon
transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global
Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures
applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.
The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Temporary
Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period.

214

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and, unless so registered, the Senior Secured
Notes may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the United States or to or for

Senior Secured Notes may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (i) for so long as
the Senior Secured Notes are eligible for resale under Rule 144A, to a person whom the seller
reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (ii) outside the
United States in a transaction complying with the provisions of Rule 904 under the Securities Act,

acceptable to the Company that such transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act), (iv) pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (v) to us or any of our subsidiaries, in

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes. This summary deals only with
Senior Secured Notes that are held as capital assets by a U.S. holder or a non-U.S. holder (as each
term is defined below) that acquires the Senior Secured Notes upon original issuance at their initial
offering price.

A “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation that is organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

   - a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and under
the control of one or more U.S. persons, or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable
U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

A “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes (other than an entity
treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not, for United States
federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder.

This summary is based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be
changed, perhaps retroactively, to result in United States federal income tax consequences different
from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal
income taxes and does not deal with foreign, state, local or other tax considerations that may be
relevant to U.S. holders or non-U.S. holders (collectively, “holders”) in light of their personal
circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the applicable United States
federal income tax consequences of holders that are subject to special treatment under United States
federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, individual
retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers or traders in securities or currencies, life insurance
companies, S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or investors therein),
tax-exempt organizations, U.S. expatriates, non-U.S. trusts and estates that have U.S. beneficiaries,
persons holding Senior Secured Notes in an integrated or conversion transaction or as a position in a
constructive sale or straddle, U.S. holders whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, or
accrual method taxpayers that for U.S. federal income tax purposes are required to accelerate the
recognition of any item of gross income as to their Senior Secured Notes as a result of such income
being recognized on an applicable financial statement. This summary also does not address U.S.
federal estate and gift tax consequences.

If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes) holds Senior Secured Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the
status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

**You should consult your own tax advisors concerning the United States federal income**
**tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes, as**
**well as the consequences arising under other United States federal tax laws and the laws of any**
**other taxing jurisdiction.**

218


-----

**Possible Alternative Treatment**

We may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on the Senior
Secured Notes, as described under “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Repurchase at the Option
of Holders—Change of Control” and “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.”
These potential payments may implicate the provisions of certain Treasury regulations relating to
contingent payment debt instruments. Under the applicable Treasury regulations, certain contingencies
do not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if such
contingencies, as of the date of issuance, are remote or incidental. We intend to take the position that
the foregoing contingencies are remote or incidental, and, accordingly, we do not intend to treat the
Senior Secured Notes as contingent payment debt instruments. Our position that such contingencies
are remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the
manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our position is not, however, binding on the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). If the IRS were to challenge this position successfully, a U.S.
holder might have inclusions in income that differ materially in timing or amount or be required to
accrue ordinary interest income on the Senior Secured Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest
rate. In addition, holders may have to treat as ordinary interest income, rather than capital gain, any
gain realized on the taxable disposition of Senior Secured Notes before the resolution of the
contingency. The remainder of this discussion assumes the Senior Secured Notes will not be treated
as contingent payment debt instruments. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders**

**_Stated Interest_**

Any stated interest payments on Senior Secured Notes to a U.S. holder will be taxable as
ordinary interest income at the time they accrue or are received, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s
regular method of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected, and the
remainder of this discussion assumes, the Senior Secured Notes will not be issued with more than a
de minimis amount of original issue discount or premium for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Dispositions_**

Generally, a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of Senior
Secured Notes will result in taxable gain or loss to a U.S. holder equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount realized on the disposition (excluding amounts attributable to any accrued and
unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent not previously included in
income) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Notes. The amount realized will
equal the sum of any cash and the fair market value of any other property received on the disposition.
A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in Senior Secured Notes will generally equal the cost of such Senior
Secured Notes to such U.S. holder. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the Senior Secured Notes are held for more than one year.
Non-corporate U.S. holders may be taxed at favorable rates on long-term capital gains. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Net Investment Income Tax_**

Certain U.S. holders who are individuals, estates or trusts are required to pay an additional 3.8%
tax on some or all of their net investment income in excess of certain threshold amounts. Net
investment income will generally include interest on the Senior Secured Notes and capital gain from
the sale or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Notes.

219

**Certain U.S. Federal Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders**

**_Interest_**

Subject to the discussion below of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), U.S.
federal income tax (including withholding tax) generally will not apply to a non-U.S. holder in respect of
any payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes, provided such payment is not effectively
connected with such non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States and such
non-U.S. holder:

   - does not own actually or constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of the voting stock of Amwins Group, Inc. within the meaning of section 871(h)(3) of the
Code and the applicable Treasury regulations thereunder;

   - is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to Amwins Group, Inc. within the meaning
of section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code;

   - is not a bank whose receipt of interest on the Senior Secured Notes is described in section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and

   - either (1) such non-U.S. holder provides identifying information (i.e., name and address) to the
applicable withholding agent on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) and
certifies, under penalty of perjury, that such non-U.S. Holder is not a U.S. person or (2) a
financial institution holding the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of such non-U.S. holder
certifies, under penalty of perjury, that it has received such a certification from the beneficial
owner and, when required, provides the withholding agent with a copy. Special certification
rules apply to non-U.S. holders that are pass-through entities rather than corporations or
individuals.

If a non-U.S. holder does not satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest
made to such non-U.S. Holder will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless such
non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed (1) applicable IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in
withholding under an applicable income tax treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) stating
that interest paid on the Note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with
such non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (in which case such interest
will be subject to regular graduated U.S. tax rates as discussed below).

The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to
the payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide
the applicable withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under
an applicable income tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an
appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.

**_Dispositions_**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, any gain realized on the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Notes by a non-U.S.
Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax unless:

   - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent
establishment) by the non-U.S. holder, in which case such gain will generally be subject to
United States federal income tax (and possibly branch profits tax) as described above; or

   - the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in
the taxable year of that disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case, unless

220


-----

an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, such non-U.S. holder will generally be
subject to a 30% United States federal income tax on any gain recognized, which may be offset
by certain United States source losses.

**_Effectively Connected Interest or Gain_**

If a non-U.S. holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the
Senior Secured Notes or gain from the disposition of the Senior Secured Notes is effectively connected
with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if an applicable income tax treaty requires, is
attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder), such non-U.S. holder
will, subject to any applicable income tax treaty, be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such interest
or gain on a net income basis in generally the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S.
holder. In addition, if such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may be subject to a branch profits
tax equal to 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for
the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders_**

A U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at the
rate of 24%) as to payments of stated interest and payments of the gross proceeds from the sale or
other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of the Senior Secured Notes. Certain
U.S. holders (including corporations) are generally not subject to information reporting and backup
withholding. A U.S. holder will be subject to backup withholding if such U.S. holder is not otherwise
exempt and such U.S. holder:

   - fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number (“TIN”), which, for an individual, is
ordinarily his or her social security number;

   - is notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding because it has previously failed to
properly report payments of interest or dividends;

   - fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS
has not notified the U.S. Holder it is subject to backup withholding; or

   - otherwise fails to comply with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to backup withholding (currently at the rate of
24%) with respect to payments of interest if such non-U.S. holder provides to the applicable
withholding agent the statement described above under “—Certain U.S. Federal Tax Considerations
for Non-U.S. Holders—Interest” or the non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption, provided
the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know such non-U.S.
holder is a U.S. person. A non-U.S. holder may, however, be subject to information reporting
requirements as to payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes. Copies of information returns
reporting such interest payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities
in the country in which non-U.S. holder resides under the provisions of a treaty or agreement.

Proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the
Senior Secured Notes made to or through a foreign office of a foreign broker without certain specified
connections to the United States will generally not be subject to information reporting or backup
withholding. A non-U.S. holder may be subject to backup withholding and/or information reporting as to

221


-----

the proceeds of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Senior
Secured Notes within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial
intermediaries, unless the payor receives the statement described above under “—Certain U.S.
Federal Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders—Interest” and does not have actual knowledge or
reason to know such non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person, or such non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes
an exemption.

**_General—U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders_**

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules will be allowed as a credit against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and may entitle a
holder to a refund, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as “FATCA”), a 30%
United States federal withholding tax may apply to interest paid on the Senior Secured Notes and the
gross proceeds from the disposition of Senior Secured Notes (unless the applicable withholding agent
relies on proposed Treasury regulations that eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross
proceeds), in each case paid to (i) a foreign financial institution (as specifically defined in the Code)
that does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either
(x) an exemption from FATCA or (y) its compliance (or deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may
alternatively be in the form of compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States)
in a manner that avoids withholding, or (ii) a non-financial foreign entity (as specifically defined in the
Code) that does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing
either (x) an exemption from FATCA or (y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United
States beneficial owners of such entity. If an interest payment is both subject to withholding under
FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under “—Certain U.S. Federal Tax
Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders—Interest,” the withholding under FATCA may be credited
against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax. You should consult your own tax advisors
about these rules.

Under proposed Treasury Regulations, this withholding tax will not apply to the gross proceeds
from the sale or other disposition of the Senior Secured Notes. The preamble to these proposed
Treasury Regulations states that taxpayers may rely on them pending their finalization. Investors
should consult their own tax advisors regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to their
ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes.

The Initial Purchasers are committed to take and pay for all of the Senior Secured Notes being
offered, if any are taken. The initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering circular.
After the Senior Secured Notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering
price and other selling terms. The offering of the Senior Secured Notes by the Initial Purchasers is
subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in
whole or in part.

The Senior Secured Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act.
Each Initial Purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the Senior Secured Notes (A) to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the United
States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities
Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the
Securities Act. Sales of any Senior Secured Notes made outside of the United States may be made by
affiliates of the Initial Purchasers.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they
will not offer, sell or deliver the Senior Secured Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons
(i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later
of the commencement of the offering or the date the Senior Secured Notes are originally issued. The
Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom it sells such Senior Secured Notes during such
40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the
Senior Secured Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, with respect to Senior Secured Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40
days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the Senior Secured Notes are
originally issued, an offer or sale of such Senior Secured Notes within the United States by a dealer
that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The Company has agreed in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that for a
period of 120 days after the date of this offering circular, neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries or other
affiliates over which it exercises management or voting control, nor any person acting on its behalf will,
without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the Senior Secured Notes.

223


-----

The Senior Secured Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The
Company has been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a
market in the Senior Secured Notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making
at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the
Senior Secured Notes.

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell Senior Secured
Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and
purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial
Purchasers of a greater number of Senior Secured Notes than they are required to purchase in the
offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of
preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Senior Secured Notes while the offering is in
progress.

The Initial Purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular Initial
Purchaser repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the discount received by it because Goldman
Sachs & Co. LLC or its affiliates have repurchased Senior Secured Notes sold by or for the account of
such Initial Purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for
their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Senior Secured
Notes. As a result, the price of the Senior Secured Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise
might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the
Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or
otherwise.

We expect that the delivery of the Senior Secured Notes will be made to investors on or
about, 2024 which will be the U.S. business day following the date of this offering
circular (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange
Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to
any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Senior
Secured Notes prior to the second U.S. business day before the settlement date will be required, by
virtue of the fact that the Senior Secured Notes initially settle in T+, to specify an alternate
settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the
Senior Secured Notes who wish to trade the Senior Secured Notes prior to the second U.S. business
day before the settlement date should consult their advisors.

The Company and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to
and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, (a) a retail investor means a person who is one (or more)
of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID
II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended or superseded, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “EU Prospectus Regulation”) and (b) the expression “offer” includes

224


-----

the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and
the Senior Secured Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe
for the Senior Secured Notes. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the “EU PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Senior
Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared
and, therefore, offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPS Regulation. This offering circular has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Senior Secured Notes in any Member State of the
EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of the Senior Secured Notes. This offering circular is not a prospectus
for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

**_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors_**

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to
and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, (a) a retail investor in the UK means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it
forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended,
the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus
Regulation”) and (b) the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means
of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Senior Secured Notes to be offered so as to
enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Senior Secured Notes. Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (as may be amended or superseded from time to time, the “UK PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Senior Secured
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the
UK PRIIPS Regulation. This offering circular has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the
Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering circular has been prepared on the basis that
any offer of the Senior Secured Notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK
Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the
Senior Secured Notes. This offering circular does not constitute a prospectus for the purposes of the
UK Prospectus Regulation and is therefore not an approved prospectus for the purposes of, and as
defined by, the UK Prospectus Regulation (or Section 85 of the FSMA) and has not been approved by
the Financial Conduct Authority or any other competent authority.

In addition, this offering circular is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional
experience in matters relating to investments and who qualify as investment professionals within the
meaning of Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order
2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”); (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to
(d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order;
(iii) are outside the UK; or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FMSA) in connection with the issue or sale

relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**Notice to Prospective Investors Hong Kong**

This offering circular has not been approved by or registered with the Securities and Futures

**Report of Independent Auditors**

**Report of Independent Auditors**

To the Management and Board of Directors of Amwins Group, Inc.

**_Opinion_**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Amwins Group, Inc. and
its subsidiaries (the “Company”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of
stockholder’s equity (deficit) and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”).

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America (US GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described
in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our
report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

**_Emphasis of Matter_**

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner
in which it accounts for leases in 2022. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

**_Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether
there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the consolidated financial
statements are available to be issued.

**Report of Independent Auditors (Continued)**

**_Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue on auditors’ report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and
therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that,
individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the
consolidated financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we:

   - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.
Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

   - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

   - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.

   - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,
that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a
reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters,
the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related
matters that we identified during the audit.

**_Other lnformation_**

Management is responsible for the other information included in the annual report. The other information
comprises Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and an Adjusted
and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation (not presented here), but does not include the consolidated financial
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the
other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and
the consolidated financial statements or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other
information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.

**AMWINS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**
**(A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN WHOLESALE INSURANCE HOLDING**
**COMPANY, LLC)**
**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020**

**_1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies_**

**_General_**

The operations of Amwins Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) consist primarily of
wholesale distribution of specialty insurance products through retail agents and brokers in the United
States of America and abroad. The operating companies conduct business in the capacity of wholesale
insurance brokers, managing general underwriters and third-party administrators.

The Company reports its results of operations through the following six segments: Amwins
Brokerage, which distributes a broad range of property and casualty (“P&C”) insurance products
nationally to retail insurance agents and brokers; Amwins Access, which distributes small business and
personal lines P&C insurance products nationally, primarily through binding authority contracts where
the insurance company has contracted with the Company to underwrite and distribute these policies on
their behalf; Specialty Underwriting, which is comprised of numerous insurance programs for specific
industry classes, trade groups and niche insurance products, and where the insurance company has
contracted with the Company to provide the underwriting services for these programs on their behalf;
Amwins Group Benefits, which distributes a range of specialty group benefit products to employer
groups or associations nationally through retail insurance agents and brokers and also provides related
administrative services to carriers; Amwins International, which distributes specialty insurance and
reinsurance products to clients worldwide through offices in 12 countries in Europe, Latin America,
Bermuda and Asia and operates a leading Lloyd’s brokerage operation in London; and Group Support
which provides management and administrative services to support the Company.

**_Basis of Presentation_**

American Wholesale Insurance Holding Company, LLC (“Holdco”) owns all of the outstanding
capital stock of the Company. There are no operating activities at Holdco. For substantially all equity
transactions of Holdco, including equity instruments issued as compensation and units issued as
consideration for business combinations, Holdco and the Company enter into contemporaneous equity
transactions in which the Company issues common shares or other equity interests to Holdco valued at
the same value as Holdco’s equity transactions. The accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Stockholder’s Equity reflect the equity transactions between Holdco and the Company that resulted
from Holdco’s equity transactions with employees and third parties.

In April 2015, Public Sector Pension Investment Board (“PSP”), a Canadian pension investment
manager, acquired approximately 31% of Holdco’s equity (the “PSP Recapitalization”) primarily from
New Mountain Capital, LLC (“NMC”) and the employee and other unit holders of Holdco. Since PSP
only acquired approximately 31% of the equity of the Company, push-down accounting was not
permitted at that time. Therefore, stockholder’s equity was not written up to fair value at the time of this
recapitalization.

In November 2016, a private equity fund managed by Dragoneer Investment Group, LLC
(“Dragoneer”) acquired all of NMC’s remaining holdings in Holdco. Since Dragoneer only acquired
approximately 35% of the equity of the Company, push-down accounting was not permitted at that
time. Therefore, stockholder’s equity was not written up to fair value at the time of this transaction.

**AMWINS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**
**(A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN WHOLESALE INSURANCE HOLDING**
**COMPANY, LLC)**
**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020**

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The stockholder’s
deficit at December 31, 2022 is the result of the prescribed accounting related to the recapitalization
transactions described above. The Company generated operating income for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, is in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2022
and expects to remain in compliance with the covenants during 2023.

Certain amounts reported in prior years in the financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current year’s presentation.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of the financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for various items,
such as the provision for cancellations, valuation of derivative financial instruments and related hedge
designation, valuation of intangible assets, valuation of asset impairment, depreciation, amortization,
loss reserves related to rent-a-captive arrangements, income taxes, the valuation of earnout
obligations and the valuation and recognition of equity-based compensation.

**_Consolidation_**

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its majority
owned subsidiaries (50% or greater ownership). Investments in partially owned entities in which the
Company’s ownership is less than 50% and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence
over operating and financing decisions and is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting. Investments in unconsolidated entities are included in other assets, and
the Company’s share of income or loss is recorded in other income. The Company records income
attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for any non-owned
portion of consolidated subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest is recorded within the equity section, but
separate from Amwins Group, Inc.’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All significant
intercompany transactions are eliminated through consolidation.

In the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2022, the
Company evaluated all material subsequent events or transactions that occurred after the balance
sheet date through the date on which the financial statements were available to be issued, which was
April 6, 2023, for potential recognition in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and/or
disclosure in the notes thereto.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Commission income and fees from the sale of property and casualty insurance products are
recorded as of the effective date of the insurance coverage or the date the coverage is bound,
whichever is later, as the performance obligation to arrange the specified service is satisfied.

**AMWINS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**
**(A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN WHOLESALE INSURANCE HOLDING**
**COMPANY, LLC)**
**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020**

Commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from insurance carriers and recorded in the
period in which the policy is endorsed or cancelled. Commission income and fees from the sale of
benefits insurance products are recognized as earned over the policy period, which typically
corresponds to the monthly billing cycle based on eligibility. The Company carries a reserve for policy
cancellations which is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary based upon historical
cancellation experience. The provision for cancellations and allowance for uncollectible premiums was
$30.7 million and $29.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Commission revenue is
reported net of commission expense incurred to the retail brokers and agents which is recognized on
the same basis as the Company’s revenue.

Other income includes contingent commissions, interest income and miscellaneous income, net
of contingent commissions paid and payable to the Company’s retail producers. Contingent
commissions are recognized to the extent future reversal is not probable. Variable consideration from
carriers is estimated on a contract-by-contract basis. Those guaranteed as a set percentage of
premium are accrued monthly over the contract period. Those based on volume of business or
percentage of growth and those based on the underlying profitability of the business are estimated and
recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal in revenue previously recognized will not
occur. Contingent commission expense due to the Company’s retail producers is generally recognized
based on the timing of the revenue earned from placing business for these retailers.

Interest income is recorded as earned. The Company earns interest income on the premiums
between the time they are collected from retail agents and brokers and the time they are remitted to
the insurance carriers. This activity is part of the normal operations and accordingly is reported in
revenues. Miscellaneous income includes underwriting income from rent-a-captive arrangements and
other miscellaneous income.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

**_Premium Cash—Restricted_**

In its capacity as an insurance broker, the Company collects premiums from insureds and, after
deducting its commissions and/or fees, remits these premiums to insurance carriers. Unremitted
insurance premiums are held in a fiduciary capacity until disbursed by the Company and are restricted
as to use by laws in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company’s subsidiaries operate.
The Company invests these funds in cash and money market accounts.

**_Premiums Receivable_**

Premiums receivable consist of amounts due from retail insurance agents and brokers for
insurance policies sold. Premium receivables are not collateralized; however, the Company can
request cancellation from the insurer if amounts are not paid and therefore has minimal credit risk for
uncollected premiums receivable. Premiums receivable are presented net of the provision for
cancellations and allowance for uncollectible premiums receivable.

**COMPANY, LLC)**
**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020**

**_Premiums Payable_**

Premiums payable represent amounts due to insurance carriers for their portion of insurance
premiums, net of the commissions to the retail agent and the Company. Premiums payable are
recognized when the related premiums receivable are recognized. The Company generally remits
payment to insurance carriers when the related amounts are collected from retail insurance agents and
brokers or policyholders.

**_Fixed Assets_**

Fixed assets are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation, in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets
may not be recoverable. Under those circumstances, if the fair value were less than the carrying
amount of the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference. Depreciation for fixed assets is
computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

**Class of asset** **Useful life**

Computer and office equipment . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 5 years
Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 5 years
Furniture and fixtures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 5 years
Leasehold improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Shorter of the lease term or useful life of the asset

Software includes the cost of developed software to be used internally. The Company expenses
all internal-use software costs incurred in the preliminary project stage and capitalizes certain direct
costs associated with the development and purchase of internal-use software within fixed assets. The
Company has capitalized $23.2 million, $14.3 million and $12.8 million of such costs during 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively.

**_Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid for acquired businesses over the estimated
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to
amortization are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company classifies goodwill and certain
trade names as indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization.

The Company reviews for goodwill impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine
whether any impairment may exist. If the Company believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment,
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a
quantitative two-step test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. For the quantitative test,
the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there
is a potential impairment of goodwill. Based on the aggregation of its business components, the
Company’s reporting units correspond to its reportable segments as defined above. If the fair value of
the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent
that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Fair value is

estimated using an income and market approach which includes consideration of multiples of
revenues, earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and
estimated discounted future cash flows.

No goodwill impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.
The Company performed a qualitative analysis as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, which did
not indicate that it was more likely than not that the carrying values of the reporting units exceeded fair
value.

For non amortizable trade names, the Company reviews for impairment by first assessing
qualitative factors to determine whether any impairment may exist. If the Company believes, as a result
of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the nonamortizable
trade name is less than its carrying value, a quantitative two-step test is required; otherwise, no further
testing is required. For the quantitative test, the Company compares the fair value of the
nonamortizable trade name with its carrying value to determine if there is a potential impairment. If the
estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the nonamortizable trade name, then an
impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value
is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows.

No nonamortizable trade name impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 or 2020. The Company performed a qualitative analysis as of December 31, 2022, 2021
and 2020, which did not indicate that it was more likely than not that the carrying values of the
nonamortizable trade name exceeded fair value.

Other identifiable intangible assets include purchased customer relationships, carrier
relationships, trade names and noncompete agreements. Purchased customer relationships are
amortized based on the expected undiscounted cash flows over the related estimated lives and
contract periods, which range from 6 to 20 years. Trade names and noncompete agreements are
amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (5 to 8 years for trade names
and 3 to 5 years for noncompete agreements). Purchased carrier relationships are being amortized on
a straight-line basis over the related estimated life of 40 years. Purchased customer relationships
obtained from acquired businesses are records and files that contain information regarding retail
insurance customers and their accounts that are essential to maintaining that relationship. Purchased
carrier relationships represent the estimated value of the program management services contract
between the Company and a mutual insurance company. The Company expects the cash flows
associated with the purchased carrier relationship to continue for a minimum of 40 years. Intangible
assets with finite lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that no conditions exist indicating they may
be impaired. No impairments have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or
2020.

**_Equity-Based Compensation_**

Equity-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the
award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is
the vesting period. If the vesting terms are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any
previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. The Company uses the “modified prospective”

method to account for equity-based compensation. The Company uses the alternative transition
method to determine the accounting of the income tax effects of payments made related to stockbased compensation.

The fair value of common stock for options granted was estimated by management using a
market-based valuation methodology. A market approach was generally used to estimate the
Company’s enterprise value by using adjusted EBITDA multiplied by relevant market multiples. The
Company did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist because the
Company had a reliable measure of fair value as a result of acquisitions and market transactions,
negotiated at arm’s-length prices with third parties throughout the period, which included equity
consideration, to support the fair value of its common stock.

**_Derivatives_**

The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the
balance sheet at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value must be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. If a derivative is designated as a hedge,
depending upon the nature of the hedge, a change in its fair value is either offset against the change in
the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
Any difference between fair value of the hedge and the item being hedged, known as the ineffective
portion, is immediately recognized in earnings in other operating expense.

**_Income Taxes_**

The Company records income tax expense using the asset and liability method of accounting for
deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the currently enacted tax rate expected to be
in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.

Valuation allowances may be recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
management concludes are more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon settlement. See Note 9 for additional information.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020**

**_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_**

Fair value accounting establishes a framework for measuring fair value, which is defined as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). This framework includes a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation technique used to measure fair value.

The classification of a financial instrument within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three
levels of the hierarchy in order of priority of inputs to the valuation technique are defined as follows:

Level 1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active
markets. Level 1 assets and liabilities include equity securities traded in an active
exchange market.

Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets,
quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and
model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are
observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 Valuation is determined using model-based techniques with significant assumptions
not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the
Company’s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of third-party pricing
services, option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques
.

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, premium cash, premiums receivable,
premiums payable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, due to the short maturity of these instruments. Fair value information for
the Company’s debt and derivatives is disclosed in Notes 7 and 8, respectively.

**_Foreign Currency_**

The functional currency for most of the Company’s foreign operations is the applicable local
currency. For those operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end
exchange rates, income and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates and equity
accounts are translated at historical rates. Net changes resulting from such translations are recorded
as a component of translation adjustments in other comprehensive income on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Foreign currency transactions are transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity’s
functional currency. At each balance sheet date, each entity remeasures the recorded balances related
to foreign-currency transactions using the period-end exchange rate. Gains or losses arising from the
remeasurement of these balances are recorded in other operating expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Certain intercompany loans are determined not to be of a long-term
investment nature. The Company records foreign currency gains and losses from such loans in the
Statements of Operations.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020**

**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**

Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.
GAAP) are established by the FASB in the form of accounting standards updates (ASU’s) to the
FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification.

The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASU’s. ASU’s not listed below were
assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In March 2020, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to reference rate reform. This
ASU provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging
relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. This
ASU is effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and
hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2024. The Company
expects to adopt this standard during the second quarter of 2023. This ASU is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_**

In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to leases, which requires
that the Company recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased
assets. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2018 for public companies and December 15, 2021 for private entities.
The Company adopted this new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2022 using the modified
retrospective method; thus prior period information will not be restated.

A lease is defined as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an asset for a period
of time in exchange for consideration. Leases are classified as finance leases if the lease transfers
ownership, has a purchase option, is for a majority of the asset’s underlying life or the total present
value of lease payments is substantially all the fair value of the asset. All other leases are classified as
operating leases. The Company’s computer equipment leases are deemed finance leases. Lease
liabilities are the present value of the remaining future fixed payments over the lease term using the
Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the time of the lease commencement. Options to extend
leases are not included in the lease term until the Company is reasonably certain those options will be
exercised. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to
borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar
economic environment. Right of use assets are the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any initial
direct costs incurred, less lease incentives received. Any variable lease payments are recognized
when incurred.

The Company has elected the package of practical expedients which permits us not to reassess
our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classificatiion and initial direct costs. We also
elected the practical expedients to not separate lease and non-lease components, to use hindsight
when determining lease terms and to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short
term leases.

**COMPANY, LLC)**
**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020**

Upon the adoption of this new guidance, the Company recognized a lease liability of
approximately $183 million and a corresponding right-of-use asset of approximately $156 million,
including the reclassification of approximately $27 million of unamortized lease incentives.

**_2. Acquisitions and Disposals_**

The acquisitions described below were recorded by allocating the cost of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the respective acquisition.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net of amounts assigned to the fair value of the
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill.

The purchase prices for acquisitions may include varying combinations of common units of
Holdco, cash funded by our existing cash flow and borrowings under our senior secured revolving
credit facility and, for certain of these acquisitions, an obligation to pay earn-out payments in common
units, cash or both.

**_2022 Acquisitions_**

During 2022, we acquired two books of business (customer accounts) and all the equity of
Business Risk Partners, LLC, a managing general underwriter and program administrator that provides
specialty commercial insurance products. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was
approximately $49.1 million.

Depending on the acquisition date and the complexity of the underlying valuation work, certain
amounts included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements may be provisional and thus
subject to further adjustments within the permitted measurement period. The Company continues to
evaluate certain assets and liabilities related to acquisitions completed during the recent periods.
Changes to amounts recorded as assets or liabilities may result in a corresponding adjustment to
goodwill.

**_2021 Acquisitions_**

During 2021, the Company acquired two books of businesses (customer accounts) and all the
equity or assets of four businesses: Worldwide Facilities Holdings LLC, a wholesale insurance
distribution business (April 1, 2021); Equisure, Inc, a general agent specializing in insurance for equine
and canine risk in which we had a 50% interest prior to the acquisition (April 30, 2021); CBIZ M.T.
Donahoe & Associates, LLC, a general agent specializing in employee and individual benefits and
services (June 1, 2021); and National Truck Underwriting Managers, LLC, a wholesale insurance
broker specializing in insurance products for companies operating in the trucking business (August 1,
2021). The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $977.2 million in cash
and equity, including our estimated earn-out obligations.

brokerage business for a purchase price of $3.2 million in cash and equity, including our estimated
earn-out obligation.

During 2020, the Company recognized a one-time net gain of $203.1 million related to the
disposal of a benefit claims adjudication business. Proceeds from the disposal were $226.2 million, net
of cash disposed.

The disposal did not qualify as discontinued operations as it did not represent a strategic shift that
has had a major impact on the Company’s operations or financial results.

On February 19, 2021, the Company amended and restated its senior secured credit facilities. As
amended, the senior secured credit facilities consisted initially of term loans of $1,995.0 million original
principal amount and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (substantially all of which was available at
close for additional borrowings).

The proceeds from these facilities were used to refinance the amounts outstanding under the
Company’s prior senior secured credit facilities initially put in place in January 2017 consisting of term
loans of approximately $1,986.6 million original principal amount and an undrawn $125.0 million
revolving credit facility, and to pay related transaction expenses. By amending the senior credit
facilities, the Company was able to extend the maturity dates of these facilities, reduce its borrowing
costs and expand certain of its operating covenants, among other things.

**COMPANY, LLC)**
**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020**

On July 19, 2021, the Company completed the offering of $790.0 million aggregate principal
amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2029 (the “4.875% Senior Notes”) made in the United States to
qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under
the Securities Act. In connection with the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes, the Company incurred
incremental term loans under our senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of
$600.0 million.

The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the 4.875% Senior Notes to repay in full
and redeem the Company’s 7.75% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”), consisting of
$650.0 million principal amount (and $2.5 million of capitalized interest), and to pay a related
redemption premium and all related transaction fees and expenses. The Company used the remaining
net proceeds from the sale of the 4.875% Senior Notes, together with the net proceeds from our
incremental term loans and cash on hand, to pay a dividend in September 2021 to Holdco (and
Holdco’s owners), and to fund payments made or to be made to certain holders of stock options of the
Company and unvested units of Holdco required in connection with such a dividend, in an aggregate
amount of $749.9 million.

In connection with the 2021 refinancing of our senior credit facilities, the issuance of the 4.875%
Senior Notes and the repayment of the 2026 Senior Notes, the Company incurred $18.6 million of
third-party expenses (included in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations) and a $42.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt consisting of a prepayment premium
and expenses to write-off unamortized original issue discount and unamortized financing fees and
expenses.

As of December 31, 2022, there was $2,516 million of term loans outstanding under our senior
secured credit facilities, net of a $12.8 million original issue discount and $17.2 million of financing
fees, $780.8 million of 4.875% Senior Notes outstanding after giving effect to $9.2 million of financing
fees, and no borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility (which carries
debt issuance costs of $2.1 million) other than undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face
amount of $2.5 million. The senior secured term loans bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or LIBOR,
plus a margin of 2.25%, and mature on February 19, 2028. As of December 31, 2022, these term loans
bore interest at 6.63% per annum. The senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at the
greater of 0.0% or LIBOR, plus a margin of 2.25%, and matures on February 19, 2026.

The 4.875% Senior Notes are unsecured and accrue interest at an annual rate of 4.875%,
payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning on
December 31, 2021. The 4.875% Senior Notes will mature on June 30, 2029.

The aggregate fair value of the Company’s debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3.2 billion
and $3.3 billion, respectively. The Company uses quoted market prices to estimate the fair value of its
debt when available. When quoted market prices are not available, the estimated fair value of debt is
based on discounted future cash flows using current credit market composite indices with similar terms
and remaining maturities.

**_8. Derivatives_**

**_Foreign Currency Hedges_**

The Company enters into foreign currency hedges to manage the exposure on forecasted
insurance placement transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. The foreign currency
hedges qualify as cash flow hedges. To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the
variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the derivatives’ fair value are not included in current
earnings, but are included in AOCI. These changes in fair value will subsequently be reclassified into
earnings when the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. In addition, if the forecasted transaction is
no longer probable, the cumulative change in the derivatives’ fair value will be recorded as other
operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period it occurs. To the extent
that a previously designated hedging transaction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness
measured in the hedging relationship is recorded in earnings in the period it occurs.

The Company had foreign currency hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $261.6 million
outstanding as of December 31, 2022, with scheduled maturities of $98.4 million in 2023. The net
unrealized loss, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI related to foreign currency hedges was $11.4 million as
of December 31, 2022. The Company expects to reclassify approximately $5.2 million of the unrealized
loss to earnings over the next 12 months

**_Interest Rate Swaps_**

The Company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as a part of its overall strategy
to manage interest rate risk on its debt. The Company’s use of derivative instruments to manage
interest rate risk has been limited to interest rate swap agreements used to modify the interest
characteristics for a portion of its outstanding variable rate debt. These interest rate swaps were
designated as cash flow hedges and were structured so that they were expected to be highly effective.

The Company has entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against a
portion of its variable rate term loans. The notional amount of the swaps is $1.8 billion. The Company
is paying interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 1.42% on the swaps. The Company is receiving
interest at the greater of the one-month LIBOR-based variable rate and either 1.00%, with respect to
$850 million notional amount of the swaps, or 0.75%, with respect to $900 million notional amount of
the swaps. At December 31, 2022, the receiving weighted average interest rate is 4.38% on the swaps.

During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings related to the interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2022, the Company expects to
reclassify $38.9 million of gains, net of tax, on derivative instruments from AOCI to earnings during the
next 12 months as interest receipts on the interest rate swaps occur. The interest rate swaps had a
weighted average remaining maturity of 2.8 years at December 31, 2022.

**_Credit Risk_**

By entering into derivative instrument contracts, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit
risk. Counterparty credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the
derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is in an asset position, the counterparty

has a liability to the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. To mitigate the counterparty
credit risk, the Company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based
upon their credit ratings and other factors.

**_9. Income Taxes_**

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was
enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tax relief measures for businesses include a fiveyear net operating loss carryback, changes in the deductibility of interest, acceleration of alternative
minimum tax credit refunds, payroll tax relief, and a technical correction to allow accelerated
deductions for qualified improvement property. The Act also provides other non-tax benefits, including
federal funding for a range of stabilization measures and emergency funding to assist those impacted
by the pandemic. The Company took advantage of the technical correction to allow accelerated
deductions for qualified improvement property.

For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”)
eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenses and requires taxpayers
to capitalize and amortize them over five years for research activities performed in the United States
and 15 years for research activities performed outside the United States pursuant to IRC Section 174.
Although Congress is considering legislation that would repeal or defer this capitalization and
amortization requirement, it is not certain that this provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. If
the requirement is not repealed or replaced, it will increase our U.S. federal and state cash taxes and
reduce cash flows in fiscal year 2023 and future years.

The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary
differences expected to reverse as global intangible low tax income (GILTI) in future years or
recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. The Company has made a policy
election to account for GILTl income tax as a current-period expense in the period when incurred.

The Company is required to recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position only when
it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon
examination. As a result, the Company has established a liability for certain tax benefits which the
Company judges may not be sustained upon examination.

The unrecognized tax benefits were included in other non-current liabilities and deferred tax
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits is
recorded in income tax expense (benefit) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
positions were not significant.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were potential benefits of $16.0 million and
$11 .3 million on December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that, if recognized, would affect the
effective tax rate on income. The Company does not anticipate that existing unrecognized tax benefits
will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

**December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020**

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has U.S. federal and state net operating loss (NOL)
carryforwards. The federal NOL is limited by Section 382. The federal and state NOL’s began expiring
in 2022. Certain states now follow the federal provision, which permits an indefinite carryforward for
NOLs generated after December 31, 2017.

The Company’s open tax years that are subject to examination in the United States are 2019
through 2021 . The open tax years subject to examination with respect to various state jurisdictions are
2018 through 2021. In addition, the statute of limitations with respect to the state’s ability to adjust net
operating losses generated before 2017 remain open to the extent of the losses generated for these
periods. The Company is currently undergoing state income tax audits; we do not expect the results to
be material.

The Company has tax filing requirements in various foreign tax jurisdictions, and the statute of
limitations varies by jurisdiction. The statute of limitation for the material foreign jurisdictions remains
open from 2017 forward. As of December 31, 2022, no foreign jurisdictions are under audit.

**_10. Stockholder’s Equity_**

In 2020, the Company declared special dividends of $1.05 billion (including $57.7 million payable
in future periods upon vesting of certain Holdco units) to Holdco (and Holdco’s owners) and option
holders whose exercise prices were lower than the dividend amount. The dividends were financed with
cash on hand and the net proceeds from the additional 2026 Senior Notes and incremental senior
secured term loans issued in December 2019 and September 2020. The dividends were recorded as a
dividend declared of $414.8 million charged to the Company’s historical cumulative retained earnings
through the dividend date, and as a return of capital of $634.9 million charged to distributions in excess
of capital.

In September 2021, the Company declared a special dividend of $749.9 million (including
$10.4 million payable in future periods upon vesting of certain Holdco units) to Holdco (and Holdco’s
owners) and option holders whose exercise prices were lower than the dividend amount. The dividend
was financed with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes, the net
proceeds from incremental term loans incurred under our senior secured credit facilities and cash on
hand. The dividend was recorded as a dividend declared of $306.3 million charged to the Company’s
historical cumulative retained earnings through the dividend date, and as a return of capital of
$443.6 million charged to distributions in excess of capital.

**_Equity Based Compensation and Incentive Plans_**

**_Warrants_**

Holdco grants profit-only units that are in most cases contingent on performance and/or timebased criteria to certain officers and employees of its subsidiaries. Correspondingly, the Company
issues a warrant to Holdco in an amount designed to equate in value to such profits-only units. Profitonly units have different participation rights than Holdco’s common units principally with respect to the
point at which the unit holders begin to participate in unit value appreciation and distributions that
Holdco may elect to make.

Holdco grants service-based nonvested units to certain officers and employees of its subsidiaries.
Correspondingly the Company issues nonvested shares to Holdco in an amount equal to the value of
such units. Service-based nonvested shares are accounted for at historical cost, which equals the fair
market value at the date of grant.

**_Stock Options_**

The Company’s 2002 Stock Option Plan (the “2002 Plan”) provided for the granting of incentive
and nonqualified common stock options to directors, officers, employees and consultants. Under the
plan, 10-year stock options to purchase approximately 1,663,000 shares of common stock were
granted through December 31, 2012, with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s
common stock at the date of grant. The 2002 Plan is no longer an active plan and no awards were
granted after June 2012.

The Company’s 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”), the successor to the 2002 Stock
Option Plan, provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified common stock options to directors,
officers, employees and consultants. The terms and conditions of grants are determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms of the 2012 Plan.
Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s common
stock at the date of grant; and those stock option awards generally vest ratably over five years and
have a 10-year contractual term. The Company has reserved 1,130,879 common shares for issuance
under the 2012 Plan. At December 31, 2022, approximately 762,000 stock options were outstanding
under this plan.

In January 2020, the Company modified its outstanding stock option awards by reducing the
exercise price of outstanding stock option awards by an amount equivalent to $20.99 per share for the
special dividend paid in January 2020. For stock option awards which had exercise prices lower than
the amount of the dividend paid, the stock option awards were reduced to $0.01 per share and an
aggregate cash payment of $5.5 million was made for the remaining difference between the reduction
in the exercise price and the dividend amount. The historical and prospective compensation expense
for the modification of the stock option awards was not adjusted as the fair value of the stock options
after the modification was not greater than the fair value of the stock option awards prior to the
modification.

In October 2020, the Company modified its outstanding stock option awards by reducing the
exercise price of outstanding stock option awards by an amount equivalent to $23.48 per share for the
special dividend paid in October 2020. For stock option awards which had exercise prices lower than
the amount of the dividend paid, the stock option awards were reduced to $0.01 per share and an
aggregate cash payment of $12.3 million was made for the remaining difference between the reduction
in the exercise price and the dividend amount. The historical and prospective compensation expense
for the modification of the stock option awards was not adjusted as the fair value of the stock options
after the modification was not greater than the fair value of the stock option awards prior to the
modification.

In September 2021, the Company modified its outstanding stock option awards by reducing the
exercise price of outstanding stock option awards by an amount equivalent to $28.34 per share for the
special dividend paid in September 2021. For stock option awards which had exercise prices lower
than the amount of the dividend paid, the stock option awards were reduced to $0.01 per share and an
aggregate cash payment of $16.8 million was made for the remaining difference between the reduction
in the exercise price and the dividend amount. The historical and prospective compensation expense
for the modification of the stock option awards was not adjusted as the fair value of the stock options
after the modification was not greater than the fair value of the stock option awards prior to the
modification.

The fair value of each stock option award was estimated at the date of grant using a BlackScholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

**2022** **2021** **2020**

Dividend yield . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0% 0% 0%

The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free
rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a U.S. government
instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected lives are based on the
simplified method described under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 (“SAB 110”). SAB 110 permits the
use of the simplified method in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 for employee option grants after
December 31, 2007, for companies whose historical data about their employees’ exercise behavior
does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term of the options. The Company

**AMWINS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**
**(A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN WHOLESALE INSURANCE HOLDING**
**COMPANY, LLC)**
**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**

**_1. Nature of operations_**

The operations of Amwins Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) consist primarily of
wholesale distribution of specialty insurance products through retail agents and brokers in the United
States of America and abroad. The operating companies conduct business in the capacity of wholesale
insurance brokers, managing general underwriters and third party administrators. The Company is a
wholly owned subsidiary of American Wholesale Insurance Holding Company, LLC, which is referred
to herein as “Holdco.”

**_2. Basis of Financial Reporting_**

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its majority
owned subsidiaries (50% or greater ownership). The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual consolidated financial
statements have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2022. In preparation of the Company’s unaudited
consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2023, management evaluated all material
subsequent events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date on which the financial
statements were issued, which was November 15, 2023, for potential recognition or disclosure therein.

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_**

Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.
GAAP) are established by the FASB in the form of accounting standards updates (ASU’s) to the
FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification.

The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASU’s. ASU’s not listed below were
assessed and determined to be either not applicable or expected to have minimal impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In March 2020, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to reference rate reform. This
ASU provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging
relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. This
ASU is effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and
hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2024. This ASU did not
have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements

**_3. Acquisitions/Equity Method Investments & Disposals_**

The acquisitions described below were recorded by allocating the cost of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the respective acquisition.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net of amounts assigned to the fair value of the
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**

The purchase prices for acquisitions may include varying combinations of common units of
Holdco, cash funded by our existing cash flow and borrowings under our senior secured revolving
credit facility and, for certain of these acquisitions, an obligation to pay earn-out payments in common
units, cash or both.

Depending on the acquisition date and the complexity of the underlying valuation work, certain
amounts included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements may be provisional and thus
subject to further adjustments within the permitted measurement period. The Company continues to
evaluate certain assets and liabilities related to acquisitions completed during recent periods. Changes
to amounts recorded as assets or liabilities may result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.

**_2023 Acquisitions/Equity Method Investments_**

In 2023, the Company acquired two books of business (customer accounts) and an international
insurance and reinsurance broker that specializes in insurance placements for the energy and marine
industries, and increased its ownership of an investment in a managing general agent for admittedmarket homeowners insurance accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The aggregate
purchase price for these transactions was approximately $179.0 million in cash and equity, including
our estimated earn-out obligations.

**_2023 Disposal_**

During the second quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a preliminary gain on disposal of an
international brokerage business of $15.4 million, subject to adjustment based on the final
determination of net asset value of the business. Proceeds from the disposal were $27.2 million.

The disposal did not qualify as discontinued operations as it did not represent a strategic shift that
has had a major impact on the Company’s operations or financial results.

On February 19, 2021, the Company amended and restated its senior secured credit facilities. As
amended, the senior secured credit facilities consisted initially of term loans of $1,995.0 million original
principal amount and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (substantially all of which was available at
close for additional borrowings). The proceeds from these facilities were used to refinance the amounts
outstanding under the Company’s prior senior secured credit facilities initially put in place in January
2017 consisting of term loans of approximately $1,986.6 million original principal amount and an
undrawn $125.0 million revolving credit facility, and to pay related transaction expenses. By amending
the senior credit facilities, the Company was able to extend the maturity dates of these facilities, reduce
its borrowing costs and expand certain of its operating covenants, among other things.

On July 19, 2021, the Company completed the offering of $790.0 million aggregate principal
amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) made in the United States to
qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under
the Securities Act.

In connection with the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes, the Company incurred incremental
term loans under our senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million.

The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2029 Senior Notes to repay
in full and redeem the Company’s 7.75% senior notes due 2026 having an outstanding balance of
$650.0 million principal amount (and $2.5 million of capitalized interest), and to pay a related
redemption premium and all related transaction fees and expenses. The Company used the remaining
net proceeds from the sale of the 2029 Senior Notes, together with the net proceeds from our
incremental term loans and cash on hand, to pay a dividend in September 2021 to Holdco (and
Holdco’s owners), and to fund payments made or to be made to certain holders of stock options of the
Company and unvested units of Holdco required in connection with the dividend, in an aggregate
amount of $749.9 million.

In February 2023, the Company incurred additional incremental term loans under its senior
secured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million. The Company used

the proceeds from these incremental term loans and cash on hand to pay a dividend in March 2023 to
Holdco (and Holdco’s owners), and to fund payments made and to be made to certain holders of stock
options of the Company and unvested units of Holdco required in connection with the dividend, in an
aggregate amount of approximately $924.8 million.

As of September 30, 2023, there was $3,335.5 million of term loans outstanding under our senior
secured credit facilities, net of a $18.4 million original issue discount and $16.4 million of financing
fees, $781.9 million of 2029 Senior Notes outstanding after giving effect to $8.1 million of financing
fees, and no borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility (which carries
debt issuance costs of $1.6 million) other than undrawn letters of credit having an aggregate face
amount of $2.0 million.

The term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities mature on February 19,
2028 and amortize in quarterly installments of approximately $8.6 million with the balance payable on
the maturity date. Term loans in the amount of $2,526.6 million bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or
one-month Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.25%,
and terms loans in the amount of $843.6 million bear interest at the greater of 0.75% or Term SOFR
plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.75%. As of September 30,
2023, these term loans bore interest at a weighted average rate of 7.82% per annum. The revolving
line of credit matures on February 19, 2026 and bears interest at the greater of 0.0% or one-month
Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR adjustment of 0.11% per annum, plus a margin of 2.25%

**_9. Derivatives_**

_Foreign Currency Hedges_

The Company enters into foreign currency hedges to manage the exposure on forecasted
insurance placement transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. The foreign currency
hedges qualify as cash flow hedges. To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the
variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the derivatives’ fair value are not included in current
earnings, but are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). These changes in
fair value will subsequently be reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction impacts
earnings. In addition, if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative change in the
derivatives’ fair value will be recorded as other operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations in the period it occurs. To the extent that a previously designated hedging transaction is no
longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded in
earnings in the period it occurs.

The Company had foreign currency hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $286.2 million
outstanding as of September 30, 2023, with scheduled maturities of $23.0 million in 2023. The
unrealized loss, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI related to foreign currency hedges was $5.1 million as
of September 30, 2023. The Company expects to reclassify approximately $5.3 million of unrealized
losses to earnings over the next 12 months.

_Interest Rate Swaps_

The Company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as a part of its overall strategy
to manage interest rate risk on its debt. The Company’s use of derivative instruments to manage
interest rate risk has been limited to interest rate swap agreements used to modify the interest
characteristics for a portion of its outstanding variable rate debt.

The Company has entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against a
portion of its variable rate term loans. These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges
and were originally structured so that they were expected to be highly effective. As a result of the
LIBOR reference rate transition, the Company engaged a third-party vendor to perform a statistical
regression analysis on each interest rate swap. The results indicated that all hedge relationships would
remain highly effective. As of September 30, 2023, all interest swaps continued to be highly effective.

The notional amount of outstanding swaps is $1.7 billion. The Company is paying interest at a
weighted average fixed rate of 1.34% on the swaps. The Company is receiving interest at the greater
of the one-month SOFR-compound variable rate plus a spread adjustment of 0.11% per annum and
either 1.00%, with respect to $750 million notional amount of the swaps, or 0.75%, with respect to
$900 million notional amount of the swaps. At September 30, 2023, the receiving weighted average
interest rate is 5.43% on the swaps.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, there was no ineffectiveness
recorded in earnings related to the interest rate swap agreements. At September 30, 2023, the
Company expects to reclassify $49.5 million of net gains, after tax, on derivative instruments from
AOCI to earnings during the next 12 months as interest payments on the interest rate swaps occur.
The interest rate swaps have a weighted average remaining maturity of 2.2 years at September 30,
2023.

_Credit Risk_

By entering into derivative instrument contracts, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit
risk. Counterparty credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the
derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is in an asset position, the counterparty
has a liability to the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. To mitigate the counterparty
credit risk, the Company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based
upon their credit ratings and other factors.

**_Warrants_**

Holdco grants profit-only units that are in most cases contingent on performance and/or timebased criteria to certain officers and employees of its subsidiaries. Correspondingly, the Company
issues a warrant to Holdco in an amount designed to equal to the value of the Holdco grant. Profit-only
units have different participation rights than Holdco’s common units principally with respect to the point
at which the unit holders begin to participate in unit value appreciation and distributions that Holdco
may elect to make.

**_Stock Options_**

The Company’s 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”), the successor to the 2002 Stock
Option Plan, provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified common stock options to directors,
officers, employees and consultants. The terms and conditions of grants are determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms of the 2012 Plan.
Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s common
stock at the date of grant, and those stock option awards generally vest ratably over five years and
have a 10-year contractual term. The Company has reserved 1,130,879 common shares for issuance
under the 2012 Plan.

In March 2023, the Company modified its outstanding stock option awards by reducing the
exercise price of outstanding stock option awards by an amount equal to $34.73 per share to reflect
the special dividend paid in March 2023. For stock option awards which had exercise prices lower than

the amount of the dividend paid, the exercise price was reduced to $0.01 per share, and the Company
paid to the holders of these option awards an aggregate cash payment of $16.9 million reflecting the
difference between the reduction in the exercise price and the dividend amount. The historical and
prospective compensation expense for the modification of the stock option awards was not adjusted as
the fair value of the stock option awards after the modification was not greater than the fair value of the
stock option awards prior to the modification.

The fair value of each stock option award was estimated at the date of grant using a BlackScholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
