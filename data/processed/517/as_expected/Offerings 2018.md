**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED MARCH 5, 2018**
**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

**LSF10 Wolverine Investments S.C.A.**
**€515,000,000 Senior Secured Notes**
**(in a combination of fixed and floating rate notes)**
**€** **% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2024**
**€** **Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2024**
LSF10 Wolverine Investments S.C.A., a corporate partnership limited by shares (société en commandite par actions) incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg (the “Issuer”), is offering € million aggregate principal amount of its % Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and
€ million aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the
“Notes”) as part of the financing for its acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of all of the outstanding securities in Stark Group A/S (the “Target”).
The Issuer will pay interest on the Fixed Rate Notes at a rate of % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each and, commencing
on, 2018. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on, 2024. Prior to, 2020, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Fixed
Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, plus
the applicable “make-whole” premium. Prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes originally
issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Fixed Rate Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103.00% of the principal
amount thereof. Prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes with the net proceeds from
certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, provided that, inter alia, at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Fixed
Rate Notes remains outstanding. At any time on or after, 2020, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Fixed Rate Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this
offering memorandum.
Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to three-month EURIBOR (which shall never be less than zero)
plus %. The Floating Rate Notes will mature on, 2024. The Issuer will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes quarterly in arrears on
each,, and, commencing on, 2018. Prior to, 2019, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the
Floating Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, plus the
applicable “make-whole” premium. At any time on or after, 2019, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Floating Rate Notes at the redemption prices specified in
this offering memorandum.
In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (including accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any) upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control,
each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in
connection with such event.
Upon completion of the offering of the Notes, the Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of, 2018 (the “Issue Date”).
Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds from the
offering of the Notes into the Escrow Account (as defined herein), in the name of the Issuer. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent (as defined
herein) and pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The release of the Escrowed Property (as defined herein) will be subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement (as defined herein) promptly following
the release of the funds from the Escrow Account. If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date (as defined herein) or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption
price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to such special mandatory
redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any.
The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by LSF10 Wolverine Bidco ApS, the direct subsidiary of the
Issuer (“Bidco”). In addition, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein), on the earlier of (a) the date on which a Post-Completion Guarantor (as defined
herein) provides a guarantee of the Revolving Credit Facility and (b) 120 days from the date of completion of the Acquisition (the “Acquisition Completion Date”), the Notes
will be guaranteed by each such Post-Completion Guarantor. The Notes Guarantees (as defined herein) will rank senior in right of payment to the respective Guarantor’s (as
defined herein) future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective
Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be
secured only by a first-ranking charge over the Escrowed Property and the Issuer’s rights under the Escrow Agreement (as defined herein) governing the Escrow Account (the
“Escrow Charge”). On or prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by first-priority interests in the
Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein). Additionally, within no later than (i) ten business days from the Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by first-priority security interests in the Initial Post-Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein) and (ii) 120 days from the
Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by first-priority security interests in the Additional Post-Completion Date
Collateral (as defined herein). The Completion Date Collateral, the Initial Post-Completion Date Collateral and the Additional Post-Completion Date Collateral are referred to
herein as the “Post-Issue Date Collateral.” The Revolving Credit Facility will be, and future hedging obligations and, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein),
certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture are permitted to be, secured by first priority security interests over, among other things,
the Post-Issue Date Collateral, contractually ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of
enforcement of the security interests over the Post-Issue Date Collateral, holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the Post-Issue Date Collateral only after the Revolving
Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, certain pension obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture, if any,
have been repaid in full. The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and ranking of the Notes Guarantees and the security
interests and the liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of
_the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and_
effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the
value of such property and assets.
There is currently no market for the Notes. Application has been made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of
and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance, however, that the Notes will be
listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated
market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as amended.
This offering memorandum may not be reproduced or used for any other purpose, nor be furnished to any other person other than those to whom copies have been
sent.
**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 29.**

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN INVESTORS**

**United States**

The Notes will be sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S and within the United States to
qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act and the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be offered or sold within the United
States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Canada**

The Notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are

provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by

-----

Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a non-Canadian
jurisdiction, section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”), the Initial Purchasers
are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in
connection with the Offering.

**European Economic Area**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made pursuant to
an exemption under Article 3 of Directive 2003/71/EC (the “Prospectus Directive”), as implemented in member states
(“Member States”) of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), from the requirement to produce a prospectus for
offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer of the Notes within the EEA should
only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us, the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do we or they
authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial
Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum.

In relation to each Member State of the EEA that has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a “Relevant
Member State”), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that
Relevant Member State, no offer is being made or will be made to the public of any Notes which are the subject of the
Offering contemplated by this offering memorandum in that Relevant Member State, other than: (i) to legal entities that
are authorized qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive; (ii) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons
(other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive; or
(iii) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive; provided that no such offer of the
Notes shall require us or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to the Notes in any
Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms
of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes, as the
same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that
Relevant Member State, and the expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive 2003/71/EC as amended, including
by Directive 2010/73/EU, and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.

**MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of
the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of
the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive
2014/65/EU (“MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in the Prospectus Directive. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum is being distributed only to and is directed only at: (i) persons who have professional
experience in matters relating to investments and are investment professionals as defined within Article 19(5) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the “Order”); (ii) high net worth bodies
corporate and any other person falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order; (iii) persons outside the United
Kingdom; and (iv) any other persons to whom it may otherwise lawfully be communicated or cause to be communicated
(all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: (i) it has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in

investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”))
received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA
does not apply to the Issuer; and (ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA in
respect of anything done by it in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

This offering memorandum must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and
will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Recipients of this offering memorandum are not permitted to transmit it to
any other person. The Notes are not being offered to the public in the United Kingdom. Any person who is not a relevant
person should not act or rely on this offering memorandum or any of its contents.

**Luxembourg**

This offering memorandum has not been approved by and will not be submitted for approval to (i) the
Luxembourg financial sector regulator (the Commission de surveillance du secteur financier) for the purposes of a
public offering or sale in Luxembourg, of the Notes or admission to the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(“LuxSE”) and trading on the LuxSE’s regulated market of the Notes or to (ii) the LuxSE for the purposes of admitting
the Notes to the official list of the LuxSE and trading on the LuxSE’s Euro MTF market (the “Euro MTF Market”).
Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold to the public in Luxembourg, directly or indirectly, or listed or traded
on the LuxSE’s regulated market or the Euro MTF Market, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other
circular, prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other material may be distributed, or otherwise made
available in or from, or published in, Luxembourg except in circumstances which do not constitute a public offer of
securities to the public subject to prospectus requirements in accordance with the Luxembourg act of July 10, 2005, on
prospectuses for securities, as amended.

This Offering Memorandum has not been filed with or approved by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority
(Finanstilsynet), the Danish Business Authority (Erhvervsstyrelsen) or any other regulatory authority in Denmark. The
Notes have not been offered or sold and may not be offered, sold or delivered directly or indirectly in Denmark by way
of a public offering, unless in compliance with the Danish Capital Markets Act (Lov om kapitalmarkeder), the Danish
Financial Business Act (Lov om finansiel virksomhed) and Executive Orders (bekendtgørelser) issued pursuant thereto as
amended from time to time.

**Finland**

This offering memorandum does not constitute a public offer or an advertisement of securities to the public in the
Republic of Finland. The Notes will not and may not be offered, sold, advertised or otherwise marketed in Finland under
circumstances that would constitute a public offering of securities under Finnish law. Any offer or sale of the Notes in
Finland will be made pursuant to a private placement exemption as defined under Article 3(2) of the Prospectus
Directive and the Finnish Securities Market Act (746/2012, as amended) and any regulation made thereunder, as
supplemented and amended from time to time. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus and has not been prepared

the Finnish Securities Market Act or any other Finnish regulation. This offering memorandum has not been filed with or
approved by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.

**Sweden**

This offering memorandum is not a prospectus and has not been prepared in accordance with the prospectus
requirements provided for in the Swedish Financial Instruments Trading Act (Sw. lag (1991:980) om handel med
_finansiella instrument) nor any other Swedish enactment. Neither the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority_
(Finansinspektionen) nor any other Swedish public body has examined, approved or registered this offering
memorandum or will examine, approve or register this offering memorandum. Accordingly, this offering memorandum
may not be made available, nor may the Notes otherwise be marketed and offered for sale, in Sweden other than in
circumstances that constitute an exemption from the requirement to prepare a prospectus under the Swedish Financial
Instruments Trading Act.

**Norway**

This offering memorandum is not a prospectus and has not been prepared in accordance with the prospectus

the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet) nor any other Norwegian public body has examined,
approved or registered this offering memorandum or will examine, approve or register this offering memorandum.

offered for sale, in Norway other than in circumstances that constitute an exemption from the requirement to prepare a
prospectus under the Norwegian Securities Trading Act of 2007.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

**Historical Financial Information**

The Issuer is a holding company formed in connection with the Transactions with no revenue-generating
activities of its own and does not have any business operations, material assets or liabilities (other than those incurred in
connection with its incorporation and the Transactions). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing
_Arrangements and the Notes—Following the completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will have no revenue generating_
_operations of its own and will depend on cash flows from operating companies to make payments on the Notes.”_
Consequently, no financial information with respect to the Issuer is included in this offering memorandum, except for
certain limited “as adjusted” financial data for the Ongoing Business as further adjusted to reflect certain effects of the
Transactions as presented in the section entitled “Capitalization.” All historical financial information presented in this
offering memorandum is that of the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all
references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “group” in respect of any financial information in this offering memorandum are
to the Target and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

This offering memorandum includes (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for
the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, including the related notes thereto, which have been prepared in
accordance with IFRS (the “Audited Financial Statements”); and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Target as of and for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2017, including the related notes
thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements” and
together with the Audited Financial Statements, the “Financial Statements”).

Within the Audited Financial Statements, the financial information as of and for the years ended July 31, 2016
and 2017 has been audited by Deloitte Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab and the financial information as of and
for the year ended July 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab.
See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the reports of the independent auditors of the Target on the Audited
Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates and judgments. These standards require management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in the Audited Financial
Statements included in this offering memorandum and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations.” The financial statements contained in the F-Pages to this offering memorandum should be_
read in conjunction with the relevant notes thereto.

On July 10, 2017, in connection with our strategy to refocus our ongoing business operations primarily on B2B
customers, we announced our agreement to divest our DIY brand, Silvan, to Aurelius Group. The sale of Silvan
concluded on August 31, 2017. Additionally, we divested our Cheapy chain, a Swedish discount chain, which was sold
in April 2014, and Oscar Perschard, a small Norwegian branch, which was sold in July 2014. We include the results of
operation, financial position and cash flows from Silvan, Cheapy and Oscar Perschard in our Financial Statements as
discontinued operations, which are shown separately from continuing operations in our Financial Statements. In this
offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, references to any financial data are only to financial data from
continuing operations and exclude the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Silvan, Cheapy and
Oscar Perschard.

In the future, we will report consolidated financial statements and other information for the Issuer and its
subsidiaries prepared under IFRS. The fiscal year of the Issuer ends on July 31 of each calendar year and the first annual
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer will be available in respect of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2018. The
consolidated financial statements of the Target in this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact
of any changes to the income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements that might occur as a
result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, the Issuer will account
for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS and will apply purchase accounting
adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the
Acquisition Completion Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for
existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our statement of financial position, which may include
intangible assets, such as goodwill, brand name, customer relationships, leasehold rights and software. We may also
recognize different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future
financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the
Target’s consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial_
_Statements.”_

-----

The financial information included in this offering memorandum was not prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). There could be significant differences between
IFRS, as applied by us, and U.S. GAAP. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor
reconcile our IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and
investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The financial information included in this offering
memorandum is not intended to comply with SEC reporting requirements. Compliance with such requirements would
require the modification, reformulation or exclusion of certain financial measures. In addition, changes would be
required in the presentation of certain other information.

**Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business**

This offering memorandum includes the (i) unaudited adjusted financial information for the Target’s ongoing
business for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and (ii) unaudited adjusted financial information for the
Target’s ongoing business for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2017 (collectively, the “Unaudited Adjusted
Financial Information for the Ongoing Business”). The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing
Business is presented to illustrate the effects of the Branch Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment on the
Target’s financial information, as described below. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing
Business is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum as well as the sections entitled “Selected Historical Financial Information” and “Unaudited
_Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business.”_

The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is not presented in accordance with
IFRS and has been derived by applying certain adjustments to the line items included in the financial information of the
Target, which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

In particular, the Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business for the three months ended
October 31, 2016 and 2017, and the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017 is adjusted to give effect to the
transactions described below, as if they occurred at the beginning of the respective period:

     - our closure of 30 underperforming branches and sale of our Sanvold business in (i) Denmark in January
2017 (14 branches), (ii) Finland in January 2017 (8 branches), (iii) Norway in March 2017 and (iv) Sweden
in April 2017 (7 branches) (the “Branch Closures”); and

     - an adjustment of the Target’s property portfolio to exclude certain operational properties in Denmark and
Norway, a distribution center in Finland, the headquarters in Copenhagen and 30 vacant properties, which
have historically been included in the Target’s financial results but do not form part of the Target’s ongoing
business that will be acquired by Lone Star Fund X in connection with the Acquisition (the “Property
Portfolio Adjustment”).

In addition, certain other financial information is adjusted to add back amortization of acquired intangible assets,
impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets, items that management considers to be exceptional and certain
other items that management considers to be non-recurring.

We present the Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business because we believe that it
reflects more closely the Target’s business that will be acquired by Bidco in connection with the Transactions and thus
provides additional information on the Target’s historical performance and financial position of the businesses and
operations to be acquired. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business may not be
comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and may have limitations as analytical tools and should
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS.

The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business reflects the application of adjustments
that are based upon available information and certain assumptions, as described above, that management believes are
reasonable under the circumstances. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is
presented for informational purposes only. Actual results may differ materially from the assumptions within the
accompanying Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the
Ongoing Business has been prepared by management and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that
would have been realized had the transactions contemplated above as of the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be
indicative of any future results of operations that we will experience going forward.

In this offering memorandum, references to financial data for the Ongoing Business are to the adjusted financial
information for the Target’s Ongoing Business and references to financial data for the Historical Business are to the
historical financial information for the Target, in each case, for the relevant period.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This offering memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA for the Ongoing
Business, EBITDA margin for the Ongoing Business, Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, Adjusted EBITDA
margin for the Ongoing Business, Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, adjusted free cash flow, capital
expenditures, adjusted capital expenditures and other measures and ratios that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, IFRS (collectively, the “Non-IFRS Measures”). Such Non-IFRS measures are presented based on
information derived from our Financial Statements and our historical accounting records and based on the Unaudited
Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business. We present the Non-IFRS Measures because we believe that
they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as
supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or
as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. The Non-IFRS Measures are not
measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to operating
profit or profit for the year or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally
accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. See
“—Historical Financial Information” and “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information, Unaudited Adjusted
_Financial Information for the Ongoing Business and Other Financial Data.”_

The Non-IFRS Measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under the
Indenture. Some of the limitations of the Non-IFRS Measures are that:

     - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

     - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

     - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

     - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, Adjusted EBITDA for
the Ongoing Business and Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business do not reflect any cash
requirements that would be required for such replacements; and

     - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business
and Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business reflect cash payments that were made, or will in
the future be made.

In addition, we have included in this offering memorandum unaudited income statement data for the Ongoing
Business for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, which has been calculated by adding the unaudited income
statement data for the Ongoing Business for the three months ended October 31, 2017 to the unaudited income statement
data for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017 and subtracting the unaudited income statement data for
the Ongoing Business for the three months ended October 31, 2016. The unaudited income statement data for the
Ongoing Business for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 has been prepared solely for the purpose of this
offering memorandum, is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for
any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set forth in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or
thousands, certain operating data or percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments
and, as a result, the totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of
such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set
forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using
the numerical data in the consolidated financial statements of the Target or the tabular presentation of other data (subject
to rounding) contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative
description thereof.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this offering memorandum regarding the market environment, market
developments, growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the markets and segments in which we
operate are based on data, statistical information, sector reports and studies as well as on our own estimates.

In drafting this offering memorandum, we used industry sources and sources on market data, including reports
prepared by Euroconstruct, OECD, Rockwool Foundation, Statistics Denmark, Statistics Norway, Statistics Finland and
SCB.

To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced by
us in this offering memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by
these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.
However, market studies and analyses are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or
technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative.

We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in the studies,
publications and financial information reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We

**EXCHANGE RATES**

The following tables set forth, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period end Bloomberg
Composite Rate expressed as U.S. dollar per €1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a “best market” calculation, in
which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask
rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the
applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and other financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. None of the
Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers represent that the U.S. dollar or euro amounts referred to below could be
or could have been converted into U.S. dollars at any particular rate indicated or any other rate.

The average rate for a year, a month or for any shorter period, means the average of the daily Bloomberg Generic
Rates during that year, month or shorter period, as the case may be. On February 28, 2018, the exchange rate between
the U.S. dollar and the euro was $1.2209 per €1.00.

**SUMMARY**

**Overview**

We are the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics. We directly operate a total of 179 branches
across Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Greenland from which we serve our diversified customer base of small
and medium-sized enterprises, which comprise our core customer group, as well as large construction companies, private
consumers and other types of customers, such as public authorities. We benefit from significant operational advantages
compared to our competitors, which are mostly “mom and pop” shops collaborating in buying groups and franchiseeowned operations. As a result, our competitors generally cannot match the combination of our harmonized sourcing
capabilities across the Nordics, collaborative customer service network and convenient national and cross-regional
product availability.

We operate four business units across the Nordics and as of October 31, 2017, we directly operated 66 branches
in Denmark, with an additional six branches in Greenland, under our STARK DK business unit, 27 branches in Finland
under our STARK FI business unit, 66 branches in Sweden under our Beijer business unit and 14 branches in Norway
under our Neumann business unit.

The following charts show the shares of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and total gross profit, excluding profit
allocated to our headquarters, for the Ongoing Business by business unit for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017:

growth during 14 out of the past 17 years across the Nordic region. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017,
management estimates that we generated approximately 60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and
approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from RMI activities and approximately 40% of total
revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from new build
activity. Our resilient cash flow during our last three years has also benefitted from our stable gross margin, variable cost
structure and effective working capital management. Our variable cost structure has allowed us to reduce labor costs,
unwind working capital and reduce capital expenditures during the most recent economic downturn.

In each of our markets, we seek to offer our customers a broad range of branded and own brand products,
consisting of heavy building materials, timber and panels, tools and hardware, flooring and joinery, light-side and other
products. The following table provides an overview of our key product categories and the percentage of our revenue for
the Ongoing Business generated by each product category during the year ended July 31, 2017:


**Key Product Category** **Types of Products**


**Share of Revenue for the**

To differentiate our business from our competitors, boost our ability to execute range innovation, control product
lifecycles and reduce our dependency on national manufacturer brands, we continue to focus on expanding the
penetration of our own brand SKUs, which have higher gross margins on average than branded SKUs, according to
management estimates. As of October 31, 2017, our own brand portfolio comprised 4,110 SKUs spread across our four
brands, Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics. We believe we are well-positioned to have the widest own brand offering in
the Nordics as a result of our size, scale and level of coordination across countries. In the twelve months ended
October 31, 2017, we derived approximately 91% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from branded products and
approximately 9% from our own brand products.

We support our 179 strategically located branches through our extensive logistics platform, which includes five
ship hubs, one light-side hub, five central distribution centers, approximately 120 delivery trucks that we directly operate
and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs, allowing for
proximity to our customers and harmonized delivery capabilities across the Nordics. Leveraging our broad physical
footprint, we offer our customers three distinct sales channels: stock collected by customers inside our branches, stock
delivered by us to our customers from our facilities, including weekday delivery within 24 hours in Denmark, and direct
delivery by us to customers from the manufacturer’s facilities. To maximize accessibility of our products across all of
our markets, we also support our operations through a variety of digitalized customer services under our online sales
platforms, including online and mobile phone order, product search and price comparison capabilities.

In the year ended July 31, 2017, after our CEO, Søren P. Olesen, stepped into the role of Group-wide CEO from
his previous position with STARK DK, we implemented our “Back to Basics” strategy which comprises a number of
strategic initiatives to refocus our business on our core SME customer group, reduce sourcing and operational costs,
build a more efficient branch and logistics network and streamline our leadership structure by enhancing local decision
making and accountability. Management estimates that these programs, together with improvements in the market, have
already had a positive effect on our revenue and earnings during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017.

As of October 31, 2017, we had 5,056 FTEs and a total headcount of 5,667 personnel, and in the twelve months
ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue for the Ongoing Business of €2,183 million and Run-rate Adjusted
EBITDA for the Ongoing Business of €109 million, and achieved a Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Ongoing
Business of 5%.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that the following strengths have been instrumental in our success and position us for future growth:

**_Strong Construction and Renovation Market Fundamentals and Outlook_**

We believe that our leading market position across the Nordics has allowed us to benefit from the strong
fundamentals of the Nordic construction and renovation market. Historically, the construction and renovation market in
the Nordics has exhibited stable growth, expanding at a CAGR of 2.4% from 2000 to 2016 according to Euroconstruct,
and proving to be among the most resilient markets during the most recent global economic downturn according to
Euroconstruct.

The Nordic construction materials distribution market is driven by total construction and renovation activity,
which in turn is driven by a variety of factors, including, among others: (i) macroeconomic trends, namely GDP, private
consumption, consumer confidence and interest rates, and (ii) regulatory initiatives, such as subsidies and tax deductions
on new construction or renovation works. Additionally, the Nordic construction materials distribution market is expected
to benefit from a number of sector-specific trends which are expected to outperform the general construction and
renovation market, according to a leading management consulting firm. Such sector-specific trends include, among other
key trends, (i) growth in SMEs within the construction and renovation industry, (ii) urbanization and changing
demographics and (iii) a growing acceptance of own brand offerings evidenced through purchases by customers.

According to Euroconstruct, the Nordic RMI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7%
between 2016 and 2019. In particular, the Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian RMI markets are forecasted to grow
at CAGRs of approximately 2.1%, 0.9%, 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, over the same period. According to
Euroconstruct, the Nordic new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 4.1% over the period
from 2016 to 2019. In particular, the Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian new build markets are forecasted to grow
at CAGRs of approximately 6.3%, 7.1%, 0.7% and 2.6%, respectively, over the same period.

**_Significant Exposure to Structurally Resilient RMI Market Across the Nordics_**

In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, management estimates RMI activity accounted for approximately
60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business, and
new build activity accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25%
of gross profit for the Ongoing Business, respectively.

The construction and renovation market in the Nordics comprises both the RMI sector and the new build sector,
and our business benefits from our significant exposure to the structurally resilient RMI sector. RMI activities in the
Nordics are significantly less affected by market fluctuations, showing more than eight times less variance in growth
rates than the new build sector according to a leading management consulting firm. RMI activity across our core markets
has shown stable through-the-cycle growth during 14 out of the past 17 years, growing at CAGRs of approximately
1.6% from 2000 to 2016 according to Euroconstruct.

**_Leading Position in the Nordics_**

We are the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics. We hold the number one position among
non-franchise builders’ merchants in the Nordics, with 11% market share based on revenue in the year ended July 31,
2016, compared to 7% market shares for the next leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics, Optimera,
according to management estimates. Management estimates that STARK DK, our most profitable business unit, holds
the number one position among non-franchise builders’ merchants in Denmark, with 20% market share (calculated on a
national market basis) based on revenue in the year ended July 31, 2016, compared to 14% market shares for the next
leading non-franchise builders’ merchants in Denmark, Bygma. Management estimates that STARK FI holds the
number one position among non-franchise builders’ merchants in Finland, with 18% market share (calculated on a
national market basis) based on revenue in the year ended July 31, 2016, compared to 10% market share for the next
leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in Finland, S-Ryhmä. Management estimates that Beijer holds the number one
position among non-franchise builders’ merchants in Sweden, with 8% market share (calculated on a national market
basis) based on revenue in the year ended July 31, 2016, which is a greater share than each other non-franchise builders’
merchant in Sweden that collectively hold 70% of the B2B and B2C market in Sweden. Management estimates that
Neumann holds the number one position among non-franchise builders’ merchants in Bergen, Tromsø and southwestern
Norway, with an overall 3% market share (calculated on a national market basis) based on revenue in the year ended
July 31, 2016, compared to an overall 21% market share for the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in Norway,
Optimera.

**_Competitive Advantages_**

We believe our scale, branch network, logistics platform, full ownership structure and broad customer-centric
product and service offering harmonized across the Nordics create competitive advantages and provide us with
significant operational advantages compared to our competitors. Our business benefits from an extensive network of 179
branches across the Nordics that are strategically located in areas with high population density and limited available
additional real estate, making it difficult for potential competitors to replicate our footprint and customer reach in our
core markets. Additionally, operating a company-owned network of branches allows us to harmonize our product
assortment and manage our product availability across our business, resulting in superior product assortment and
availability in branches and via delivery while simultaneously enabling optimized working capital levels. For instance,
STARK DK promises product availability on a certain core range of approximately 1,000 SKUs, which if not available
in-branch, will be delivered to our customers in Denmark within four hours and free of charge. Leveraging our scale, we
also benefit from significant harmonized sourcing capabilities across the Nordics which allow us to streamline our
sourcing efforts and negotiate better pricing terms with our suppliers. We are thus able to provide better pricing to our
customers and optimize cost to serve to improve our competitiveness in the market. In addition to our branch network,
we fully control an extensive logistics platform consisting of five ship hubs, one light-side hub, five central distribution
centers, approximately 120 delivery trucks that we directly operate and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks
across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs, which allows for proximity to our customers and enables us to
meet our customers’ demand for flexible collection and delivery services on a national and cross-regional basis. As of

-----

October 31, 2017, we had a deep and loyal customer base of approximately 29,000 active customers, which we define as
customers who have spent more than €5,000 on our products and services in the year ended July 31, 2017. As of
October 31, 2017, we support our customers with a dedicated sales force of more than 850 employees, excluding branch
sales staff and office sales support staff, as well as tailored post-sale service offerings, such as credit accounts. We
believe that operating a company-owned network of branches allows us to share best customer service practice across
branches and provides our customers with consistently high service.

Additionally, we believe that we face only a limited threat from pure-play online retailers who lack the physical
store footprint to provide the in-person specialist advice that is important to our customers in their purchasing decisions
as well as the special infrastructure required to deliver heavy-side building materials, which make up a significant
portion of the products we sell. Heavy building materials and timber and panels possess low value to weight ratios,
which have historically proved to be unprofitable for pure-play online retailers. We also believe that pure-play online
retailers are unable to meet our customers’ requirement for personalized relationships and post-sale services, including
our ability to offer customers individualized pricing options and sales discounts, customer credit options, complex
logistics solutions, in-branch advice, in-person technical support and quicker access to products, maintenance services
and replacement products.

**_Diversified Business Model_**

We sell to a diversified customer base who use our products in a variety of end markets and to which we offer
varied sales channels. Collectively, this diversification provides downside protection in times of cyclicality and thus
comprises key drivers of resilience of our business.

We have established strong, long-lasting relationships with a wide range of customers, including SMEs, which
comprise our core customer group, as well as large construction companies, private consumers and other types of
customers, such as public authorities. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top 20 customers only
generated approximately 7% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 3% of gross profit for the
Ongoing Business, with the remaining approximately 93% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately
97% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business being generated by a long tail of customers, including SME customers for
whom STARK Group is a critical supplier. Our fragmented customer base is further diversified in that both small and
large customers often have a variety of product preferences and requirements, purchasing from multiple product
categories, frequently and in small quantities, making our role as a “one stop shop” for our core customer groups
particularly important.

In addition to low customer concentration, our business benefits from a diversified mix of sales channels
designed to maximize the accessibility of our products, including: (i) stock collected by customers inside our branches,
(ii) stock delivered by us to our customers from our facilities, and (iii) direct delivery by us to customers from the
manufacturer’s facilities. In the year ended July 31, 2017, we generated approximately 38%, 29% and 33% of total
revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 60%, 27% and 13% of total gross margin for the Ongoing Business
from our stock collected, stock delivered and direct delivery channels, respectively.

Furthermore, our business benefits from geographic diversification, which enables us to capitalize on the
different macroeconomic growth drivers of our core markets of Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway. As the different
growth drivers experience peaks and troughs at different times, our business benefits from more stable through-the-cycle
revenue generation. In addition, as the Nordic region as a whole may experience a separate economic cycle, our business
benefits from resistance to national economic cycles, which is a stabilizing factor with respect to our revenue.

Lastly, we are exposed to a diverse supplier base and are not dependent on a single supplier for the operation of
our business. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top ten suppliers, excluding unmapped suppliers,
accounted for approximately 28% of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business, with no one supplier accounting
for 10% or more of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business.

**_High Customer Retention due to Steady Base of Loyal SME Customers and Best-in-Class Product and Relationship_**
**_Offerings_**

We rely on a deep and loyal base of SME customers who exhibit frequent purchasing patterns with respect to our
products and services. As of October 31, 2017, our active customer base of 29,000 customers, which we define as
customers who have spent more than €5,000 on our products and services in the year ended July 31, 2017, had an
average life of 9.8, 7.5, 6.0 and 8.3 years in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway, respectively. According to exit
interviews of 119 customers of STARK DK, Bygma or XL Byg, conducted by a leading management consulting firm in
2016, about 83% of our customers in Denmark purchase our products at least once a week.

-----

SMEs represent our largest gross profit pool, and we estimate SMEs represent a higher percentage of our revenue
for the Ongoing Business than the percentage of revenue generated by SMEs in the total Nordic construction materials
distribution market. We continue to provide SMEs with a leading assortment of products and services, guaranteed
availability of key products and more favorable pricing and credit terms when compared to our competitors. For
example, compared to our competitors, we believe we offer our SME customers the best warranty and loyalty benefits.
On average, our SME customers have shopped with us for approximately ten years in Denmark and approximately eight
years in Sweden.

**_Value of Business is Underpinned by Owned Real Estate Portfolio_**

We own an extensive portfolio of 195 freehold properties with more than 1,000,000 square meters of space and
an average gross leasable area of 5,820 square meters, including 153 properties at which we operate branches, covering
key above-market growth areas across the Nordics. Given the large portion of owned branches, our business benefits
from low impact from rent expenses on our cash flow when compared to our competitors across Europe as we do not
have a fixed monthly cash outflow with respect to such rent expenses. In the year ended July 31, 2017, management
estimates that external rent accounted for only 14% of our EBITDA for the Ongoing Business. By contrast, external rent
represented approximately 20% and 37% of EBITDA for Ahlsell and Byggmax, respectively, during each of their 2016
financial years. In addition, as a result of our owned property portfolio, a large portion of our capital expenditures is
discretionary as we can generally decide the timing of any improvements to such properties, and we have historically
had the flexibility to reduce our capital expenditures during economic downturns.

As of September 30, 2017, our freehold real estate portfolio was independently valued at up to €805 million,
covering over 150% of our indebtedness for the Ongoing Business after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions.

**_Variable Cost Structure Provides Resilient Earnings and Cash Flow_**

Our cost structure has historically provided us with significant downside protection during periods of adverse
economic conditions. Given the intrinsic nature of a distributor business, approximately 90% of our cost base is either
directly linked to sales (such as cost of sales and fleet costs), or is considered by management to have a high potential for
short-term right-sizing (such as employee costs related to employees with flexible contracts and fleet costs). Our fixed
costs mainly relate to the fixed portion of our employee costs, including our base employee and pension costs,
administrative expenses and other fixed costs, such as costs related to IT functions. Additionally, we have historically
been able to further adjust our cost structure during economic downturns by rationalizing discretionary costs related to
advertisement, infrastructure, administration and IT, which allowed us to maintain stable margins between 2006 and
2011 compared to a number of our key competitors. The following chart provides an overview of the drop in peak and
trough EBITDA margin and EBIT margin of a number of building material distributors as well as selected Nordic
manufacturers of building material products:

(1) We define absolute drop in EBITDA margin and EBIT margin as the difference between peak and trough margins. We define the peak period as
between 2006 and 2008 and we define the trough period as between 2008 and 2011.

_Note: The financial data presented in this table is not calendarized. STARK’s EBITDA margin and EBIT margin are based on Ferguson’s Nordics_
financials as reported by Ferguson in its consolidated financial statements, and exclude the year ended July 31, 2016 due to unavailable public
data. STARK’s EBITDA margin and EBIT margin are not directly comparable to the EBITDA margin and EBIT margin, respectively, of the
Target for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, due to subsequent changes in STARK’s business, including as a result of the Branch
Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data.” EBITDA margin and EBIT margin for
STARK’s competitors are based on publicly available information, and STARK’s competitors may calculate EBITDA margin and EBIT margin
differently from STARK. As a result, STARK’s EBITDA margin and EBIT margin for the periods indicated herein may not be comparable to
the EBITDA margin and EBIT margin of its competitors.

Additionally, the rigorous management of our working capital, including through the tightening of credit controls
and improvement of payment terms with suppliers, and our flexible capital expenditure levels, have historically allowed
us to generate significant cash flows, resulting in a cash conversion rate, defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing
Business less adjusted capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, of 72%, 70% and
61% for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We believe that our efficient working capital
management will allow us to continue maintaining resilient financial performance going forward.

**_Experienced Management Team Has Refocused Our Business and Introduced Cost Saving Initiatives_**

Our business is supported by an experienced management team, including, for instance, our CEO, Søren P.
Olesen, and our Business Development Director, Daniel R. Potok, with a combined 39 years of experience in the
construction and renovation and retail industries. Mr. Olesen, who stepped into the role of Group-wide CEO in
November 2016, brings with him 24 years of experience in the construction and renovation industry, including three
years as CEO of STARK DK. Our Business Development Director, Daniel R. Potok, who recently joined the Group,
brings with him more than 15 years of experience in the professional service sector advising leading Nordic and
European builders’ merchants and retailers. Our senior management team is supported by the CEOs and managing
directors of each of our business units, comprising a leadership team with significant industry experience.

In the year ended July 31, 2017, following a comprehensive review of our leadership position in the Nordic
construction materials distribution markets, our customer value propositions and the management of our operations, our
CEO together with other members of senior management began implementing our “Back to Basics” strategic plan,
incorporating clearly defined cost saving and efficiency initiatives. Our “Back to Basics” initiatives aim to drive our
top-line growth by creating a customer centric business model refocusing our operations on our SME core customer
group, enhance our profitability by streamlining our headquarters and central administration functions, enforcing crossfunctional collaboration between our headquarters and business units and driving better sourcing initiatives through
leveraging our scale, and rationalizing our footprint by exiting unprofitable branches and locations and simplifying our
distribution network.

**_Implementation of Strategic Initiatives Has Yielded Positive Results_**

In connection with our “Back to Basics” strategy, to increase focus on our SME segment, we exited our Silvan DIY
business in 2017 and developed and launched a new SME marketing campaign to leverage our fastest growing profit pool.
Additionally, to optimize our physical footprint, in 2017, we closed 30 underperforming branches in low growth areas to
focus our business on regions that are expected to outperform national averages. Furthermore, to streamline administrative
functions, in 2016, we initiated significant downsizing at our headquarters, including the relocation of 178 FTEs from our
central headquarters to the business unit level to clarify responsibilities and increase accountability and a total planned
reduction of 55 FTEs, excluding the hiring of 19 FTEs, expected to be completed by the end of June 2018. We have also
initiated (i) further leveraging of our harmonized sourcing platform across the Nordics by rationalizing our supplier base to
maximize purchasing power, (ii) the expansion of our own brand offerings to support gross margin development while
rationalizing our product portfolio, (iii) the simplification of our distribution network and reduction of our distribution costs
and (iv) the optimization of our branch network with an eye toward regions where we have identified growing demand for
our products. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key
_Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Cost Saving and Other Strategic Initiatives.”_

We estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate cost savings of approximately €7 million in
the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 through our “Back to Basics” strategy, mainly as a result of better contractual
terms following our renegotiation of key supply contracts and as a result of headcount reductions and a more streamlined
headquarters if these cost saving measures had been implemented on November 1, 2016. Overall, we have identified
approximately €74 million in operational, sourcing- and network-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which
we aim to realize by 2021. Additionally, we have initiated several topline growth initiatives, primarily related to product
assortment, availability and pricing, which management believes, together with improvements in the market, have
resulted in an increase in revenue for the Ongoing Business of approximately 5% during the twelve months ended
October 31, 2017. We believe that our operational improvements have allowed us to outperform the market in each of
Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway in the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017.

**Our Strategy**

Based on our key strengths, our ongoing strategic plan continues to focus primarily on cost-reduction and, to a
lesser extent, growth in our revenue and market share through the following strategies:

**_Better Sourcing_**

To reach our objective of developing better sourcing processes, we are implementing a systematic review of our
supply chain operations by focusing on three key components: (i) our own brand products, (ii) our direct sourcing costs
and (iii) our indirect sourcing costs. We have already begun to implement several initiatives in connection with these key
components, the results of which we expect will positively impact our financial position in the near term.

Historically, there was a lack of focus on our own brand product portfolio and an excessive overlap of our own
brand product proposition with our branded product proposition, with the vast majority of our own brand SKUs not
being shared across our business units. By increasing our focus on own brand products, we intend to increase leverage
with our suppliers and continue supporting our margins, as own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on average than
branded SKUs, according to management estimates. As of October 31, 2017, our own brand portfolio comprised 4,110
SKUs spread across our four brands: Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics. We are currently building a strategic common
core range of 800 own brand SKUs which will have reduced overlap with our branded products portfolio. Furthermore,
following our disposal of our Silvan DIY business and in line with refocusing our business on our SME core customer
group, we will continue to reduce the number of our DIY SKUs. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we
derived approximately 9% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from own brand products. Based on independent
market studies, we estimate that own brand products will double their share of the relevant market in the Nordics by
2020, and in line with this estimated growth, we aim to more than double the share of our revenue generated by our own
brand products.

Historically, there was a lack of focus on our direct sourcing costs, including as our business units each defined
product categories independently and entered into individualized Nordic framework agreements with suppliers. As a
result, we only took limited advantage of bundling purchases from suppliers across business units to achieve volume
discounts and partially utilized our eSourcing tool, which aims to optimize efficiency and decrease our sourcing spend
through various internet-enabled sourcing methods to reduce the time spent on in-person price negotiations, collect
pricing data easily and enable high competition among suppliers. In addition, we previously did not track key
performance indicators consistently across business units, preventing us from adequately monitoring and driving
performance. Consequently, we believe there is significant potential for savings with respect to our direct sourcing costs,
and under our “Back to Basics” strategy, we intend to decrease our direct sourcing costs by better leveraging our
position as the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics, while building longer term relationships with
key suppliers to further reduce costs and ensure the quality and security of the supply for a number of our key products.
On August 1, 2017, we launched STARK Group Sourcing, our harmonized sourcing unit across the Nordics, which is
designed to maximize sourcing synergies between our business units through a three-step process of (i) rationalizing our
suppliers, (ii) rationalizing our product assortment and common core range of SKUs and (iii) improving payment terms
with suppliers. We believe STARK Group Sourcing will enable us to benefit from significant economies of scale.
Leveraging a “one door” decision making policy, our sourcing unit will continue to conduct best practice and fact-based
negotiations with suppliers under direct sourcing campaigns, with the aim of further reducing costs and increasing
efficiencies.

Historically, there was a lack of focus on our indirect sourcing costs, leading to decentralized sourcing processes
and unexploited cost saving opportunities in key indirect sourcing areas such as marketing and logistics, IT and facility
management. As part of our “Back to Basics” strategy, we have identified initiatives which we believe will reduce our
indirect sourcing costs with minimal effort. Such initiatives include continuing to streamline our supplier base, creating
performance-based supplier contracts and improving the management of demand for our products and supplies.

We have identified approximately €51 million of sourcing and procurement-related cost savings for the Ongoing
Business, which we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.

**_Stronger Network_**

To enhance our ability to serve customers, we seek to continuously improve our customers’ experience in our
branches by building a stronger branch network and providing more efficient logistics operations and higher availability
of stock. In line with our “Back to Basics” strategic plan, we will continue optimizing the footprint of our branches to
capture the benefit of expected growth in the markets in coming years and increase our competitive advantages. We aim
to increase the accessibility of our branches through facility improvements which are tailored to the needs of our
customers and trends in our markets and aimed to provide consistent and positive customer shopping experiences. While
our business benefits significantly from our current geographic coverage, we may in the future pursue strategic
relocations and consolidations of certain branches to better locations along highly travelled roads benefiting from higher
footfall or visibility and will assess any new branches that we bring into our network on a case-by-case basis. We
continue to monitor our existing branch base to selectively close or merge branches that are performing poorly or
otherwise do not meet our expectations.

To pursue cost saving opportunities, we have identified several measures which we intend to action in the short
term. For instance, we aim to further simplify our distribution network while optimizing our delivery routes and pricing

terms by, among other things, establishing additional ship hubs, developing our recently established light-side hub in
Denmark to streamline the distribution of slow moving items, downsizing and outsourcing certain of our centralized
warehouse processes to achieve cost savings and consolidating the number of dedicated branches used for the
distribution of products to better allocate our resources.

We have identified approximately €13 million of network-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which
we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.

**_Efficient Operator_**

We aim to continue optimizing our operations to create a leaner, more efficient operational structure with
improved support for our business units and reduced costs. In connection with our “Back to Basics” strategy, we have
focused on cost management through reduced overhead costs by having reorganized our managerial structure and
optimized the size of our headquarters, with the aim of strengthening local decision-making and accountability and
regaining focus on day-to-day operations at the business unit and branch level while still maintaining efficiency through
centralized functions from our headquarters, including for strategy, performance, human resources and compliance
across our business.

We have identified approximately €11 million of operational cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which we
aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.

**_Drive Top-Line Growth_**

We intend to continue driving our top-line growth by enhancing our value proposition to SMEs, providing
leading customer services, implementing smart pricing and leveraging our physical assets and industry experience. We
continue working with and for our SME customers to offer better terms and shopping experiences. For instance, we are
rationalizing our product assortment by focusing on trade-specific “high runner” products that SMEs prefer, and
guaranteeing availability of certain core assortments of products to immediately fulfill our customers’ requirements.
With respect to such trade-specific “high runner” products, we aim to improve our smart pricing strategy to maintain a
reputable value perception among our customers and to simultaneously drive movement in inventory and revenue.
Furthermore, we intend to capture digital growth opportunities by leveraging our existing physical network of branches
and logistics facilities, as well as industry experience and product expertise and improving our online platform for SMEs
to quickly, efficiently and comprehensively serve and advise our customers on the best products for each of their
projects’ needs. In connection with these strategic initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to increase revenue and
profitability as we continue capitalizing on our scale and competitive advantages.

**The Sponsor**

Following the completion of the Acquisition, Lone Star Fund X will be the indirect principal shareholder of the
Group. Lone Star Fund X is the most recently established opportunity fund organized by the principals of Lone Star.
Lone Star Funds (“Lone Star” or the “Sponsor”) is a leading private equity firm that invests globally in real estate,
equity, credit and other financial assets with affiliate offices in North America, Western Europe and Asia. Since the
establishment of its first fund in 1995, Lone Star has closed approximately 480 investments in over 1,400 transactions at
an aggregate purchase price of approximately $190 billion (including acquisition financing and co-investors), such as
investments in Xella, Esmalglass, the Balta Group, Forterra and Continental Building Products.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On November 10, 2017, the Issuer, an entity indirectly owned by Lone Star Fund X, entered into the Acquisition
Agreement to acquire, indirectly, through its wholly-owned, direct subsidiary, Bidco, from the Seller all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of the Target. We currently expect the Acquisition to complete in the spring of 2018. The
consummation of the Acquisition is, however, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance by the
competent merger control and foreign investment law authorities, and the performance of certain closing actions. Under
the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Bidco has agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the required
clearances as soon as possible after the signing of the Acquisition Agreement. If these conditions are not satisfied on or
prior to the Acquisition Longstop Date, and such date has not been extended by the parties, the Acquisition Agreement
may be terminated.


10


-----

The Acquisition Agreement contains customary warranties and indemnities (including several related to certain
specific tax liabilities) given by the Seller as to capacity, title and disclosure as well as customary covenants given by the
Seller regarding, among other things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of the Group pending closing of the
Acquisition. The Seller’s liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations. Pursuant
to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the purchase price payable for the Target will be determined on the basis of a
completion account mechanism taking into account the actual level of assets and liabilities, including net debt, debt like
items and net working capital, of the Target on the Acquisition Completion Date. As a result, the final purchase price
will be dependent on the timing of the Acquisition Completion Date. See also “—Sources and Uses of the Transactions”
and “Use of Proceeds.”

In connection with the Acquisition, the Target is preparing, and in some cases has completed preparations, to
operate on a stand-alone basis certain functions that the Target has previously shared with Ferguson. The Target believes
it will incur limited costs in replicating such functions, including in relation to insurance, IT, finance and treasury. See
also “—Summary Historical Financial Information, Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing
_Business and Other Financial Data.”_

Lux Holdco, the direct parent of the Issuer, holds 100% of the limited shares of the Issuer and Lux GP, the
Issuer’s general partner, holds the only unlimited share in the Issuer. Each of Lux Holdco and Lux GP is a private
limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. The
Issuer and Lux Holdco are indirectly owned and controlled by Lone Star Fund X, and were incorporated by affiliates of
Lone Star Fund X as acquisition vehicles for the Transactions. Neither the Issuer nor Lux Holdco has any business
operations or material assets or liabilities other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the
Transactions.

**_The Financing_**

The Acquisition is expected to require €1,100 million of debt and equity financing (including transaction fees
and expenses and cash funded to the Target’s balance sheet for general corporate purposes). The Acquisition will be
financed through (i) the issuance of the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of €515 million (the “Financing”) and
(ii) €585 million of shareholder funding to be provided by Lone Star Fund X (the “Shareholder Funding”).

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, pursuant to which
the Revolving Credit Facility will be made available for drawing in the amount of €100 million. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Based on our current estimate of our cash_
flow and operations, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to meet our
seasonal working capital requirements. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.”_

The proceeds of the Financing and the Shareholder Funding will be used as further described under “—Sources
_and Uses of the Transactions.” We refer to the Acquisition, the Shareholder Funding and the Financing collectively as_
the “Transactions.” See “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and
“Description of the Notes.”

**_Escrow Account_**

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the
Offering into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged on a firstranking basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The release of the Escrowed Property is
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition promptly following
release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption.” If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the business day immediately_
following the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price for the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate
issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date
of such special mandatory redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption.” In the event that the funds on deposit in the Escrow Account are insufficient to pay the special mandatory_
redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, Lone Star Fund X will make an
equity contribution to the Issuer in an amount required to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory redemption date. See
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the Acquisition—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer will be_
_required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.”_

**Sources and Uses of the Transactions**

The sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the table below
assuming the Acquisition Completion Date had occurred on October 31, 2017. Actual amounts will vary from the
amounts shown in this table depending on several factors, including the actual Acquisition Completion Date and
differences from our estimates of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions. Pursuant to the completion
account mechanism in the Acquisition Agreement, Lone Star Fund X will acquire the Target on a cash-free and debt-free
basis, and the actual purchase price for the Acquisition will be determined based on the actual level of assets and
liabilities, including net debt, debt like items and net working capital, of the Target on the Acquisition Completion Date.
As a result, the actual purchase price for the Acquisition will depend on the timing of the Acquisition Completion Date
and may be higher or lower than the estimated purchase prices as of October 31, 2017.

(1) Represents the Shareholder Funding, comprised of an equity contribution and deeply subordinated shareholder debt, which will be contributed
and/or on-lent by Lux Holdco to the Issuer. The Shareholder Funding will include the proceeds from the private placement of €100 million
aggregate principal amount of PIK Toggle Notes to be issued by PIK Holdco on or about the Acquisition Completion Date. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—PIK Toggle Notes.”_

(2) Represents the purchase price for the Acquisition as if the Acquisition Completion Date had occurred on October 31, 2017, and assumes that the
Target’s cash, net debt and debt like items on the Acquisition Completion Date will be equal to the Target’s cash, net debt and debt like items as
of October 31, 2017 and that the Target’s net working capital on the Acquisition Completion Date will be equal to the average net working
capital of the Target for the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, in each case, as calculated under the Acquisition Agreement. The actual
purchase for the Acquisition may vary depending on several factors including the actual cash, net debt, debt like items and net working capital
position of the Target on the Acquisition Completion Date. Based on our current estimate of our cash flow and operations, we expect to draw on
the Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to meet our seasonal working capital requirements. We anticipate that we will
repay such drawings in the subsequent months as our working capital requirements decrease. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.”_

(3) Represents the amount of cash expected to be funded to the Target’s balance sheet in connection with the Transactions, which will be used for
general corporate purposes, including, among other things, funding future capital expenditures and acquisitions, the payment of interest or the
repayment of debt.

(4) Includes estimated expenses in connection with the Transactions, including discounts, commissions and commitment, placement, advisory and
other fees related to the Notes and Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent the Notes are issued with original issue discount, the amount of fees
and expenses will increase. This amount may differ from the estimated amount depending on several factors, including differences from our
estimates of fees and expenses and the actual fees and expenses as of the completion of the various transactions referred to in the table above.

**Recent Developments**

**_Current Trading_**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have completed trading for the six months ended January 31,
2018. Based on preliminary results, derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information currently
available, we estimate that for the six months ended January 31, 2018, we generated total revenue for the Ongoing
Business between €1,087 million and €1,131 million, an increase of 4% to 8% compared to total revenue for the
Ongoing Business for the six months ended January 31, 2017. Furthermore, we estimate that we generated Adjusted
EBITDA for the Ongoing Business of between €46 million and €48 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018,
an increase compared of 27% to 33% to our Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the six months ended
January 31, 2017. The increase in revenue for the Ongoing Business was primarily due to an increase in sales in
Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business was primarily due to
growth in sales volumes and higher gross profit in Sweden and Denmark, partially offset by higher operating costs to
support such growth in sales volumes.

Based on preliminary results, derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information currently
available, we estimate that for the three months ended January 31, 2018, we generated total revenue for the Ongoing
Business between €481 million and €501 million, an increase of 4% to 8% compared to total revenue for the Ongoing


12


-----

Business for the three months ended January 31, 2017. Furthermore, we estimate that we generated Adjusted EBITDA
for the Ongoing Business of between €5 million and €6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, an increase
of 52% to 92% compared to our Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the three months ended January 31,
2017. The increase in revenue for the Ongoing Business was primarily due to an increase in sales volumes in Denmark
and Finland as well as tight cost control as a result of our “Back to Basics” strategy. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA
for the Ongoing Business was primarily due to growth in sales volumes and higher gross profit in Sweden and Denmark,
partially offset by higher operating costs to support such growth in sales volumes.

This preliminary information is based on internal management accounts and has been prepared under the
responsibility of our management. This preliminary information has not been audited, reviewed or verified; and no
procedures have been completed by our external auditors with respect thereto. It is not intended to be a comprehensive
statement of our financial or operational results for the Ongoing Business for the six months ended January 31, 2018 or
the three months ended January 31, 2018, and you should not place undue reliance thereon. This preliminary information
is subject to confirmation in our audited consolidated financial statements and audit report for the year ending July 31,
2018. Consequently, upon publication of our audited results for the year ending July 31, 2018, we may report results that
are materially different from the ones set forth in this section. See “Information Regarding Forward-Looking
_Statements” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this offering memorandum for a more complete discussion of certain of the_
factors that could affect our business, financial position and results of operation.

(1) Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, Lone Star Fund X will indirectly hold (through wholly-owned or majority-owned intermediate
holding companies) substantially all of the share capital of the Target (other than the indirect shareholding being acquired by management).
Following the Acquisition Completion Date, Lone Star Fund X plans to implement a management participation program for certain directors,
managers and officers of the Group. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Management Participation Program.”

(2) In connection with the Transactions, on or about the Acquisition Completion Date, PIK Holdco is expected to issue €100 million of PIK Toggle
Notes in a private placement, the proceeds of which will be contributed and/or on-lent to Bidco as part of the Shareholder Funding to finance a
portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition. See “—Sources and Uses of the Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.” For a description of the
key terms of the PIK Toggle Notes, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—PIK Toggle Notes.”

(3) Lone Star Fund X will indirectly provide an aggregate €585 million to Lux Holdco by way of the Shareholder Funding. Lux Holdco will
contribute and/or on-lend such funds to the Issuer. The Issuer will, in turn contribute and/or on-lend such funds, as well as proceeds from the
Notes offered hereby, to Bidco. Lux Holdco, the Issuer and Bidco are holding companies with no independent business operations and no
significant assets, other than the equity interest each of these companies holds in its subsidiaries and, with respect to the Issuer only, the
Escrowed Property it holds in the Escrow Account pending consummation of the Acquisition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Financing Arrangements and the Notes—Following the completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will have no revenue generating operations_
_of its own and will depend on cash flows from operating companies to make payments on the Notes.”_

(4) The Notes will be general senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will be guaranteed by the Guarantors as set forth under “Description of the
_Notes—Notes Guarantees” and will be secured by the Collateral as set forth under “Description of the Notes—Security.” Pursuant to the_

Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility and in the future may also secure hedging obligations and
other indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and secured on an equal basis with the Notes. Under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes, amounts
recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to repay
indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

(5) As part of the Transactions, the Issuer and the Guarantors will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which provides for the
Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of €100 million. The initial borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility will be the Issuer and Bidco.
Subject to certain limitations, other subsidiaries of the Issuer, including the Guarantors, which also guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility, may
become borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit
_Facility Agreement” for a summary of the key terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. Based on our current estimate of our cash flow and_
operations, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to meet our seasonal working capital
requirements. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting
_Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.”_

(6) On the Issue Date, Bidco will be the sole Guarantor of the Notes. We expect the Post-Completion Guarantors to be Beijer Byggmaterial
Aktiebolag, DT Finland Oy, DT Holding (Sweden) AB, Neumann Bygg AS, Stark Danmark A/S and Stark Group A/S. The obligations of a
Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent
conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise reflect limitations under applicable law. By virtue of these
limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. Other indebtedness of the Guarantors may not be similarly limited.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes
_will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their_
_validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantee and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the_
limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Security Interests.” Management estimates that the Guarantors (other than Bidco) accounted for at least 80% of total revenue for the Ongoing_
Business and at least 80% of Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, and held at least 80% of our total
assets as of July 31, 2017. Management estimates that the subsidiaries of the Target that will not be Guarantors accounted for less than 20% of
total revenue for the Ongoing Business and less than 20% of Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, and
held less than 20% of our total assets as of July 31, 2017. Within 120 days following the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to certain
adjustments and the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer is required to ensure that the Guarantors (other than Bidco) accounted for at least
80% of (i) total revenue for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the
year ended July 31, 2017 and (iii) total assets as of July 31, 2017. As of October 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Target’s
subsidiaries that will not be Guarantors would have had no third-party debt outstanding.

120 days from the Acquisition Completion Date will be guaranteed by
the Post-Completion Guarantors, in each case on a senior secured basis,
as described below under “—Notes Guarantees” and “—Ranking of the

AB, Neumann Bygg AS, Stark Danmark A/S and Stark Group A/S
(collectively, the “Post-Completion Guarantors”) on the earlier of (a) the date

Facility and (b) 120 days from the Acquisition Completion Date. The Notes
Guarantees will be limited as described under “Risk Factors—Risks Related

As of October 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and
the Guarantors would have had total third-party debt in the aggregate amount
of €515 million, consisting of the Notes. In addition, we would have had
€100 million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility. The
Indenture will permit the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined
herein) to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Management estimates
that the Guarantors (other than Bidco) accounted for at least 80% of total
revenue for the Ongoing Business and at least 80% of Adjusted EBITDA for
the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, and held at least 80%
of our total assets as of July 31, 2017.

Within 120 days following the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to certain
adjustments and the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer is required to
ensure that the Guarantors (other than Bidco) accounted for at least 80% of
(i) total revenue for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017,

(ii) Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31,
2017 and (iii) total assets as of July 31, 2017.

**Ranking of the Notes Guarantees . . . .** The Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor, at the time a Guarantor grants such
Notes Guarantee, will

                         - be senior obligations of the Guarantor, secured as set forth under
“—Security”;

                         - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Guarantor’s existing
and future senior indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of
payment to its Notes Guarantee, including any indebtedness under the
Revolving Credit Facility;

                         - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated
indebtedness of the respective Guarantor;

                         - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of
such Guarantor’s subsidiaries that are not also Guarantors;

                         - be effectively senior to any existing and future indebtedness of each
Guarantor that is not secured by the Collateral owned by such
Guarantor, to the extent of the value of such Collateral; and

                         - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of
each Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure
the Notes Guarantees on an equal basis, to the extent of the value of the
property or assets securing such indebtedness.

The Notes Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances.
See “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees.”

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured only by the Escrow Charge.

Pursuant to the Security Documents to be entered into on or prior to the
Acquisition Completion Date, and substantially simultaneously with our
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, no later than the Acquisition
Completion Date, the Issuer, Bidco and Lux Holdco will grant in favor of the
Security Agent, liens and security interests on an equal and ratable first
priority basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection
requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, over (i) the capital stock of
the Issuer and Lux GP held by Lux Holdco, (ii) certain structural
intercompany receivables owed from time to time to Lux Holdco by the
Issuer and Lux GP, (iii) the capital stock of Bidco held by the Issuer, (iv) the
material bank accounts of the Issuer held in Luxembourg, (v) certain
structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by Bidco, (vi) Bidco’s
rights under the Acquisition Agreement and (vii) Bidco’s material bank
accounts held in Denmark (together, the “Completion Date Collateral”).

Pursuant to the Security Documents to be entered into within no later than ten
business days from the Acquisition Completion Date and substantially
simultaneously with our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility,
Bidco will grant in favor of the Security Agent, liens and security interests on
an equal and ratable first priority basis, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral
Liens, over (i) the capital stock of the Target held by Bidco and (ii) certain
structural intercompany receivables owed to Bidco by the Target (together,
the “Initial Post-Completion Date Collateral”).

Pursuant to the Security Documents to be entered into on the earlier of (a) the
date on which our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will be so
secured and (b) 120 days from the Acquisition Completion Date, and


18


-----

substantially simultaneously with our obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant in favor of the Security
Agent, liens and security interests on an equal and ratable first priority basis,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and
any Permitted Collateral Liens, by pledges of the capital stock in and over the
material bank accounts of each Guarantor (the “Additional Post-Completion
Date Collateral” and together with the Escrow Charge, the Completion Date
Collateral and the Initial Post-Completion Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).
The security interests in the Collateral are limited as necessary to, inter alia,
recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and
defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that
relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

The liens and security interests securing the Notes may be released under
certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first priority security interests
securing the Notes are contractually deemed to rank equally with the security
interests that secure (but only to the extent that such security is expressed to
secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility,
(ii) certain obligations under hedging arrangements and (iii) certain other
future indebtedness and obligations permitted to be incurred under the
Indenture, including, but not limited to, Pension-related Obligations. Such
security interests are, or will be, evidenced by security documents for the
benefit of (whether directly or through the Security Agent) the holders of the
Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the holders of
certain other future indebtedness or obligations permitted to be incurred
under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject
to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Revolving Credit
Facility or the Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including
from the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral, will be
required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility,
certain future indebtedness and obligations, including Pension-related
Obligations, permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and future
hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes, following the payment of
fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees
and expenses of any other creditor representative of future indebtedness
permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security
interests.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the relevant security unless
instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement). The relevant Instructing Group or such other class of creditors
as specified by the Intercreditor Agreement may, under certain conditions, be
entitled to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the relevant security subject
to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In
the event of conflicting instructions, the Intercreditor Agreement contains
provisions as to which set of instructions will prevail. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the Notes
or the Notes Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction for
or on account of taxes unless required by law. If the Issuer or the Guarantors
are required by law to withhold or deduct amounts for or on account of tax


19


-----

imposed by a relevant taxing jurisdiction with respect to a payment to the
holders of Notes, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will, subject to certain
exceptions, pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount
received by the holders of the Notes after the withholding or deduction is not
less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of the
withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding
_Taxes.”_

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We intend to use the proceeds of the Offering together with the Shareholder
Funding to (i) fund the purchase price for the Acquisition, (ii) fund cash to
the balance sheet of the Target for general corporate purposes and (iii) pay
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . . . .** Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will,
concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the
gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes into the Escrow Account, in the
name of the Issuer. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow
Agent and pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the
Notes. The release of the Escrowed Property will be subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition
pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement promptly following the
escrow release. If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property have
not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the
occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price of the Notes
will be equal to 100% of the aggregate initial issue price of the Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to such special mandatory
redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any.

**Optional Redemption:**

Fixed Rate Notes: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Prior to, 2020, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem all or
a portion of the Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes plus the applicable “make whole”
premium described in this offering memorandum and accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes originally issued (including the
aggregate principal amount of any additional Fixed Rate Notes issued) in
each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal
amount thereof.

Prior to, 2020, the Issuer will be entitled at its option on one or more
occasions to redeem the Fixed Rate Notes in an aggregate principal amount
not to exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes
with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price
equal to % of the principal amount outstanding in respect of the Fixed
Rate Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
redemption date, so long as at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Fixed Rate Notes remains outstanding immediately after each such
redemption and each such redemption occurs within 180 days after the
closing date of the relevant equity offering.

On or after, 2020, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem
all or a portion of the Fixed Rate Notes at the applicable redemption prices
set forth under the heading “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Optional_
_Redemption—Fixed Rate Notes” plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but_
excluding, the redemption date.


20


-----

Floating Rate Notes: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Prior to, 2019, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem all or
a portion of the Floating Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes plus the applicable “make
whole” premium described in this offering memorandum and accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On or after, 2019, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem
all or a portion of the Floating Rate Notes at the applicable redemption prices
set forth under the heading “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Optional_
_Redemption—Floating Rate Notes” plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but_
excluding, the redemption date.

**Optional Redemption for Tax**
**Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation which cause the Issuer
to pay additional amounts, the Issuer may redeem the relevant Notes in
whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional
amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See “Description
_of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a change of
control, the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. A change of
control will not be deemed to have occurred on one occasion if, after giving
_pro forma effect to such change of control, a specified consolidated total net_
leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Notes” is
not exceeded as a result of such event. See “Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control.”_

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the Issuer and
the restricted subsidiaries of the Issuer to:

                         - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred
stock;

                         - create or incur certain liens;

                         - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with
respect to the shares of the Issuer;

                         - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

                         - make certain investments;

                         - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or
other distributions, loans or advances to and on the transfer of assets to
the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries;

                         - sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of restricted
subsidiaries;

                         - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                         - consolidate or merge with other entities;

                         - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes;
and

                         - amend certain documents.

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no established

may discontinue market making at any time without notice. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the
Notes.

such listing will be maintained.

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by the laws of the State of
New York. Under the terms of the Indenture, the governing law of the
Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. The
Intercreditor Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales. The

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION, UNAUDITED ADJUSTED FINANCIAL**
**INFORMATION FOR THE ONGOING BUSINESS AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA**

The following tables summarize certain of our historical financial information, Unaudited Adjusted Financial
Information for the Ongoing Business and other financial data for the periods ended on and as of the dates indicated
below. In the following tables and notes thereto, references to financial data for the Ongoing Business are to the adjusted
financial information for the Target’s Ongoing Business and references to financial data for the Historical Business are
to the historical financial information for the Target, in each case, for the relevant period. The Target’s Ongoing
Business refers to the Target’s historical financial information after giving effect to the Branch Closures and the
Property Portfolio Adjustment. See also “Presentation of Financial and Other Data.” The Target’s Historical Business
refers to the Target’s business before giving effect to the Branch Closures and Property Portfolio Adjustment. The
financial data for the Target’s Historical Business is reflected in the Financial Statements.

We have extracted (i) the consolidated historical financial data of the Target as of and for the three months ended
October 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, from the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and (ii) the consolidated
historical financial data of the Target as of and for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 from the relevant
Audited Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We have extracted the
Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and
2017, and the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, from the section entitled “Unaudited Adjusted Financial
_Information for the Ongoing Business.”_

In addition, the following tables include unaudited income statement data for the Ongoing Business for the
twelve months ended October 31, 2017, which has been calculated by adding the unaudited income statement data for
the Ongoing Business for the three months ended October 31, 2017 to the unaudited income statement data for the
Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017 and subtracting the unaudited income statement data for the Ongoing
Business for the three months ended October 31, 2016. The unaudited income statement data for the Ongoing Business
for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering memorandum, is
for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any future period or our
financial condition at any future date.

The following tables also present certain as adjusted and run-rate data which we include for information purposes
only, and which does not purport to present what our results of operations and financial condition would have been, nor
does such data project our results of operations for any future period or financial condition at any future date. In
addition, while certain of the financial data set forth below have been derived on the basis of historical financial
information prepared in accordance with IFRS, such financial data contains financial measures other than those in
accordance with IFRS and should not be considered in isolation from or as substitutes for our historical financial
information. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is not presented in accordance
with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial data has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors and should not be considered as an
alternative to any measure of liquidity or performance derived in accordance with IFRS for the applicable periods.

Prospective investors should read the summary data presented below in conjunction with, and the summary data
presented below is qualified in their entirety by reference to, “Presentation of Financial and Other Data,” “Use of
_Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Financial Information,” “Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information_
_for the Ongoing Business,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”_
and the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(a) Consists of purchases related to certain operational properties in Denmark and Norway, a distribution center in Finland, the
headquarters in Copenhagen and 30 vacant properties, which have historically been included in the Target’s financial results but do
not form part of the Target’s ongoing business that will be acquired by Lone Star Fund X in connection with the Acquisition.
(b) Purchase of intangible assets is presented on a historical basis and is not adjusted for discontinued operations or adjusted for the
Branch Closure or the Property Portfolio Adjustments. Purchase of intangible assets principally represents spending on software.
Software is used centrally by the group throughout all branches. Management does not allocate the capital expenditures in relation to
intangible assets on a branch by branch basis. However, management believes that the historical purchases of intangible assets relate
primarily to the Ongoing Business.
(c) Freehold capital expenditures in the year ended July 31, 2017 related to the purchase of the freehold site at Risskov, an existing Stark
DK branch that was previously leased. Freehold capital expenditures in the year ended July 31, 2015 related to the purchase of the
freehold of an existing Stark FI branch that was previously leased.
(d) Relates to the purchase of the land and development of the new Stark Denmark distribution center at Braband, which management
considers to be non-recurring.

(3) EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business are
supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We calculate EBITDA for the
Ongoing Business as historical profit for the period before financial income, financial expenses, tax for the period, depreciation and
amortization excluding the impact on operating profit resulting from the Branch Closures, as described in “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Data” and “Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business.” We believe EBITDA for the Ongoing Business is a useful_
financial metric for assessing operating performance. We believe that it also facilitates comparison between us and our competitors. We define
Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business as EBITDA for the Ongoing Business before exceptional items related to the Ongoing Business
and the Ferguson Group management fee, which reflect historical charges to us of Ferguson Group-related functions and services, such as
finance and treasury support and oversight, which we believe will no longer be indicative of our financial performance following the
Acquisition Completion Date. As such, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business provides investors with a useful tool for
assessing the comparability of our core business between periods because it excludes certain items that do not reflect the ongoing performance
of our business.

EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business are Non-IFRS Measures and the use of these measures has
certain limitations. Our presentation of EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business may be different
from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The terms EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and
Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business are not defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles, and EBITDA
for the Ongoing Business and Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business are not measures of net income, operating income, operating
performance or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in
isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in
accordance with IFRS.

We calculate Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business as Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business adjusted for (a) certain
estimated costs that we will incur as a stand-alone business following the Acquisition Completion Date to replicate services previously provided
to us as part of Ferguson Group, such as treasury services, insurance policies and share-based incentive payments which used to be covered by
Ferguson’s share plan, and (b) the annualized results from certain costs savings and other performance improvement initiatives that we
implemented during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 as if we had implemented such cost savings and performance improvement
initiatives on November 1, 2016. Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business is subject to the same limitations as EBITDA for the
Ongoing Business and Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business. Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business is presented for
illustrative purposes only and does not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any historical or future period.

Our presentation of Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business may be different from the presentation used by other companies and
therefore comparability may be limited. In evaluating Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, you should be aware that, as an
analytical tool, it is subject to certain limitations. In particular, run-rate cost savings and performance improvement are based on management
estimates and assumptions and are forward looking in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may
not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives for the period presented and may not be
comparable with our Financial Statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum, and should not be relied
upon when making an investment decision.

(i) Under our “Back to Basics” strategy, we focused on, among other things, decentralizing our decision making processes,
developing our SME customer base, tailoring our product assortment to better serve customers and developing our new
distribution center. In connection with these initiatives, we incurred costs related to consulting and advisor fees, inventory
write-offs, staffing and bonus payments. We consider such costs to be exceptional.

(ii) Restructuring represents consulting and advisor fees incurred in connection with restructuring our head office and STARK FI,
which we consider to be non-recurring costs.

(iii) The profit/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment relates to the gain on sale of our Cheapy chain, a Swedish
discount chain, in Sweden during the year ended July 31, 2016 and the loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment in
Denmark.

(iv) The profit on disposal of businesses represents adjustments to provisions in respect of prior year disposals by STARK FI.

(b) Ferguson Group management fee represents certain charges to us by Ferguson for historical Ferguson Group-related functions and
services, such as finance and treasury support and oversight, which will no longer be indicative of our financial performance following
the Acquisition Completion Date.

(c) GSTS Group IT costs include costs incurred in connection with Ferguson’s shared technology service for the provision of shared data
centers, applications, security, maintenance and engineering, primarily driven by a European data center operating out of the United
Kingdom that we will no longer incur following the completion of the Transactions. GSTS Group IT costs were €4 million, €1 million
and €1 million for the year ended July 31, 2017, for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and for the three months ended
October 31, 2017, respectively.

(d) Group insurance costs relate to payments for insurance policies under the Ferguson Group insurance policy that we will no longer incur
following the completion of the Transactions. Group insurance costs were €2 million for the year ended July 31, 2017, there were no
Group insurance costs in the three months ended October 31, 2016 or October 31, 2017.

(e) Group share based payments include charges for long-term incentives which will no longer be applicable. Group share based payments
were €2 million for the year ended July 31, 2017, there were no Group insurance costs in the three months ended October 31, 2016 or
October 31, 2017.

(f) Estimated FTE costs include estimated costs related to the hire of one additional FTE to provide treasury services, one additional FTE to
provide support to the Group CFO and five additional FTEs to provide infrastructure and IT strategy support, previously provided by
Ferguson.

(g) Estimated non-FTE costs include estimated treasury system costs that we expect will be incurred in connection with replicating treasury
services previously provided to us by Ferguson’s treasury, estimated costs incurred in connection with outsourcing our HFM
consolidation system, costs related to like-for-like insurance replacement and estimated costs related to the replacement of share based
payments to certain key employees which were previously covered by Ferguson’s share plan.

(h) Estimated incremental IT costs relate to the estimated procurement costs of external IT services to replicate Ferguson’s GSTS IT
systems.

(i) Represents the annualized cost savings from our cost saving initiatives, including the simplification and centralization of our
administrative functions, the optimization of our footprint and the rationalization of our local workforce, which we implemented during
the year ended July 31, 2017, as if these initiatives had been implemented on November 1, 2016, and mainly include the full-year effect
of (i) headcount reductions at our headquarters (€2 million) and (ii) headcount reductions at our business units (€2 million).

(j) Represents the annualized cost savings from our better sourcing initiatives, which we implemented during the year ended July 31, 2017,
as if these initiatives had been implemented on November 1, 2016, and mainly include reduced sourcing costs following a renegotiation
of key supply agreements and assuming that supply volumes for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 were in line with volumes
for the year ended July 31, 2016.

(4) EBITDA margin for the Ongoing Business means EBITDA for the Ongoing Business divided by revenue for the Ongoing Business.

(5) Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Ongoing Business means Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business divided by revenue for the Ongoing
Business.

(6) As adjusted net senior secured debt for the Ongoing Business represents our senior secured debt adjusted for the Transactions and includes the
€515 million aggregate principal amount of Notes offered hereby less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents. See “Use of Proceeds” and
“Capitalization.”

(7) As adjusted cash interest expense for the Ongoing Business represents interest payable for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, adjusted
to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds as contemplated under “Use of Proceeds,” as if the
Transactions had occurred on November 1, 2016. As adjusted cash interest expense reflects the interest expense in connection with the Notes
offered hereby, and assumes that the Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn on the Acquisition Completion Date. Based on our current
estimate of our cash flow and operations, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to meet our
seasonal working capital requirements. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—

**RISK FACTORS**

_In addition to the other information contained in this offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the_
_following risk factors before purchasing the Notes. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones_
_we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may_
_also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the possible events described_
_below were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely_
_affected. If that happens, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due, respectively, and you_
_could lose all or part of your investment. This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that_
_involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering_
_memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry**

**_We are affected by general economic conditions in our regions._**

The construction materials distribution industry in any geographic market is dependent on the level of activity in
the construction and renovation sector of that geographic market, including with respect to both RMI and new build
activities. The level of new build activities and, to a lesser extent, RMI activities tends to be cyclical and is dependent on
the prevailing economic climate, including, among other things, GDP growth, unemployment levels, salaries (including
minimum wages), the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence, demographic developments, immigration
levels and consumer perception of economic conditions as well as the level of construction- and renovation-related
expenditures in the residential and non-residential sectors, public and private spending on infrastructure projects and
public investments. Decelerating economic growth in certain major global cities and concerns regarding the extent of
such deceleration may also have an impact on the global economic outlook and increase volatility in the markets,
including the construction materials distribution markets in which we operate, and thus indirectly have a negative impact
on demand for some of our products.

Due to the cyclicality of certain of the end-markets we serve, in particular the new build sector of the
construction materials distribution industry, our future sales and sales margins will vary and, consequently, our
profitability and absolute profit levels will also fluctuate. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, management
estimates RMI projects accounted for approximately 60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately
75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business, and new build projects accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue
for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business in the same period. During an
economic downturn or in periods of low economic growth, end-users may hire commercial builders less frequently, and
as a result B2B customers may buy less of our products, as consumers seek to increase savings and postpone
cost-intensive new build projects and, to a lesser extent, RMI projects. Revenue generated by our customers’ propensity
toward new build activities has historically and recently been more susceptible to cyclicality than RMI activities. New
build activities in Denmark today, for example, remain approximately 33% below peak levels, according to
Euroconstruct. Consequently, during periods of economic downturn or low economic growth, we have recorded, and
may continue to record, lower sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

**_We operate in highly competitive markets, which could adversely affect demand for our products and could affect our_**
**_financial performance._**

The B2B construction materials distribution industry is competitive and fragmented in the markets in which we
operate. We face, and will continue to face, competition from local, regional, national and international B2B building
materials suppliers, manufacturers and distributors, as well as from privately owned single-site retailers. Competition in
the B2B construction materials distribution industry is subject to a number of variables, including convenience of
location, product availability and range, delivery services, pricing strategies, customer service, availability of credit,
technical product knowledge with respect to application and usage and advisory capabilities. Currently, our major
competitors are XL Byg, Optimera, Bygma, S-Ryhmä, Woody, Byggmakker, Kesko and Maxbo. Any of these
competitors may predict the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are
superior to our products, have the ability to produce or supply similar products at a lower cost, develop stronger
relationships with professional homebuilders or commercial builders, adapt more quickly to new technologies or
evolving customer requirements or have access to financing on more favorable terms than we can obtain.

We also face competition from European operators of large superstores, some of which may expand into the
Nordics either through organic growth or by acquiring smaller builders’ merchants with an existing market share in the

29


-----

Nordics. Large competitors could use economies of scale to their advantage, and may be able to, among other things,
purchase inventory and/or sell products at lower prices, make substantial marketing expenditures or offer a superior
in-branch experience compared to our branches. Actions taken by competitors, as well as actions taken by us to maintain
competitiveness and a reputation for value for money, have placed, and may continue to place, pressure on product
pricing, gross margins and profitability. Furthermore, some of our competitors, including both B2B builders’ merchants
and general retailers may be able to negotiate better contracts with major suppliers, acquire business real estate at better
locations or devote greater resources to advertising and marketing campaigns to procure new customers.

Additionally, we face competition from our larger suppliers. Such suppliers may supply their products directly to
the B2B customers that comprise our target market, including organizing distribution and logistics themselves.
Alternatively, such suppliers may agree to supply directly to our customers, with our business providing an invoice
service only. As a result, we may experience fewer volumes sold to our customers, lost volume bonuses for our
purchases from suppliers, lost margins and in the case of invoice servicing, continued legal and contractual risk for the
products delivered. Suppliers may also elect to enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with our competitors. Any of
these conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

In addition, our customers, particularly B2B customers, have historically exerted and will continue to exert
pressure on our and their other suppliers to keep prices low because of their market share and their ability to leverage
such market share in the highly fragmented construction materials distribution industry. Moreover, consolidation among
B2B customers, and changes in their purchasing policies or payment practices, may result in increased competition for
their business and consequently additional pricing pressure, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We may not be able to effectively compete with competitors,
which could threaten our market position in the markets in which we operate, and negatively affect our levels of sales
and profit margins. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued
investment in, among other things, refurbishing our branches, sourcing and developing new products and maintaining
and developing our digital capability, our logistics network and our offering, including our supplier base, sales channels,
sales and marketing capabilities and customer relationships. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources
to make the necessary investments, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. If we are unable to compete
effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected.

**_We may not be able to accurately predict and address customer and end-user preferences, demand and demographics._**

We have assembled our product offering across our multiple business units and have built a multi-modal
customer service platform that attempts to provide our customers with an extensive range of building materials that
address their needs as well as the needs of end-users. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to
identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in product developments, local population demographics and customer
and end-user preferences, expectations and needs, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an
excellent customer experience. Demand in the B2B construction materials distribution industry may be affected by, for
example, demographic trends among end-users, such as aging and declining populations, changes in the average number
of persons living in one household, the increasing average living space per capita or migration trends. As a result, we
must offer a sufficient range of products to satisfy varying customer and end-user preferences and demographics. Our
competitors may offer a more compelling product mix or may stock a greater number of SKUs, including for substitutes
for our products that may be or become more popular or may be perceived as having superior characteristics. We also
must be able to train our in-branch personnel to understand new products, some of which are technologically complex,
and sell those products to our customers. We may not be able to accurately predict customer and end-user preferences or
demand for certain products, and some of our products may be rendered obsolete because of developments in
technology.

If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing trends or misjudge the market, customer demand
or consumer preferences and demographics, our revenue may decline and we may have a substantial amount of unsold
inventory or missed sales opportunities. In response, we may be forced to rely on promotional activities to dispose of
excess or slow-moving inventory. We may spend substantial sums developing products with our suppliers, or we may
enter into minimum purchase contracts with suppliers for goods, which may exacerbate losses if those products are not
successful. In contrast, in the event that certain products are more successful than anticipated, we may need to restock
initial inventories at one or more of our locations. Despite our robust supply chain, we may not be able to replenish a
particular branch that has reduced stock and we may therefore end up with insufficient inventory at particular locations.
Such an inventory shortage might result in unfilled orders and lost revenue. Any failure to adequately address customer
and consumer preferences and properly maintain inventory levels could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Customer expectations about the methods they use to purchase and receive products or services are also
becoming more demanding. Customers now routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products
and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products, which could make our traditional branchbased or phone-based operations less appealing. Once products are purchased through any of these channels, customers
are demanding convenient options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick and low-cost delivery. We
must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchase and delivery process, including with respect to
pricing trends, which are made more visible with online price comparison capabilities, as well as existing and new
competitors, who may be able to provide lower prices, greater choice and/or superior convenience through their online
sales platforms. Our ability to strategically improve our online sales platforms to support our traditional branch-based
sales also depends on a number of other factors, including our ability to successfully market our websites, the hiring,
training and retention of qualified IT personnel and the compatibility of our websites with newer customer devices.
Growing our online sales platforms will result in increased reliance on information technology, the interruption or failure
of which could adversely affect our business. Performance issues with these customer facing technology systems,
including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or cyber attacks, or a complete failure of one or
more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could negatively affect business and
harm our reputation or our customers’ perceptions of us.

Furthermore, we have a branch network that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the
shopping experience that our customers desire. We must also maintain a safe branch environment for our customers and
associates. If we cannot maintain the standards at our branches and utilize our branch space effectively, timely identify
or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and construction and renovation needs, positively
differentiate the customer experience for our main customer groups from our competitors or effectively implement a
comprehensive and compelling merchandising assortment, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and
our market share, could each be adversely affected.

**_Our results may be adversely affected by the housing market, changes in housing regulations or government_**
**_monetary or fiscal policies._**

The condition of local housing markets particularly affects customer demand for the products we sell. Generally,
in stable or strong housing markets, sales of building material products benefit from housing moves and renovations
undertaken by end-users. However, in a weaker housing market, factors such as tighter restrictions on the availability of
mortgage financing, slower household formation growth rates, lower existing home sales, reduction in government
incentives and falling home prices may limit consumers’ propensity to move or build houses or undertake discretionary
renovations on existing properties either themselves or through a professional, which could result in a decreased demand
for building materials. Accordingly, weak housing markets in the countries in which we operate may result in a decrease
in sales of our building material products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow.

In addition, the construction and renovation industry is subject to various local, national and regional statutes,
ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, renovation, energy and
water conservation and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in
order to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area or in order to maintain
certain areas as primarily or exclusively residential. Regulatory restrictions may increase our operating expenses and
limit the availability of suitable building lots for B2B customers and B2C customers, which could negatively affect our
sales and earnings. In addition, building codes may affect the products that B2B customers and B2C customers are
permitted to use, and consequently, changes in building codes may affect the saleability and marketability of our
products.

Moreover, the demand for our products and services is impacted by monetary and fiscal policies in each of the
countries in which we operate. This includes policies that have the effect of encouraging or discouraging construction
and renovation, such as long-term interest rates, tax policies such as tax reduction for repairs, conversion and extension
(“ROT”), policies encouraging or discouraging labor mobility and migration, availability of financing or subsidies, the
allocation of government funding for public infrastructure programs, and safety regulations that encourage or discourage
the use of certain materials and products. Interest rate changes, for example, affect demand for residential and
non-residential structures, which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities. Interest rate changes
could also affect the ability of B2B customers and B2C customers to finance purchases. In addition to changing interest
rates, central banks and other policy terms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit
available in an economy. Changes in liquidity and credit policies, including the reduction or elimination of favorable tax
or other stimulus programs, could adversely impact our customers, markets and suppliers, any of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our business depends on a strong brand image and reputation._**

We believe we enjoy high brand awareness in the Nordic B2B construction materials distribution market for our
business unit brands, namely STARK DK, STARK FI, Beijer and Neumann. We also believe that maintaining and
enhancing our brand is integral to the success of our business and to the implementation of our business plans. Our
maintenance, promotion and positioning of our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and
merchandising efforts, and our ability to provide good customer experiences. Our brand could be adversely affected if
we fail to achieve these objectives or if negative publicity tarnishes our public image or reputation. Our brand image
may be diminished if we fail to maintain high standards for, among other things, the timely and efficient delivery of
quality products and an after-sales service, if we fail to maintain high social and environmental standards for all our
operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience other negative events
that affect our image or reputation. Moreover, other factors that we may be unable to control could tarnish our
reputation, such as any safety issues with our products due to the fault of the supplier and any resulting product liability
claims against us.

In addition, the widespread use of social media by customers and consumers, including blogging and use of and
feedback about our business or products on social media activities can negatively affect our business, as criticism in
blogs, forums and on social media, and regardless of whether such criticism is based on facts, may rapidly spread online
and may damage our reputation and our brand. These platforms also could be used for the dissemination of trade secret
information or compromise other valuable company assets, any of which could harm our business. The harm may be
immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Any failure to maintain a strong brand image
could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, we sell our own brand products through our own four brands, Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics,
which each represent an important asset of our business. Maintaining the reputation of and value associated with these
own brand names are central to our success. Certain of our policies, including our pricing policies and our expansion
policies, could damage our reputation and the value associated with our own brand names and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We believe our own brand
products offer potentially significant commercial opportunities and we are investing in these brands and related supply
and distribution networks, but there can be no assurance that these brands will generate sufficient sales volumes and
customer demand to match our expected long-term return on investment. We may have to further develop, improve and
expand our own brand product portfolio and services in the future, for example by entering new end-user markets and
adapting our products to new applications and regulatory or customer requirements. Our success in meeting our
customers’ needs and expectations is dependent on various factors, such as market research, a well-developed
understanding of the strategies and requirements of customers new to our business, the right positioning in markets new
to us or of our new products and technologies, as well as the ability to research, develop and offer new or improved
products and technologies at competitive terms. If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of our own brand
products, our reputation may be diminished, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow.

In addition, as we seek to expand our own brand product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due
to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater
responsibility for administering and complying with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product
liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of
those products. In addition, to effectively execute our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to
successfully protect our proprietary rights and navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties.
Furthermore, an increase in sales of our own brand products may adversely affect sales of certain of our suppliers’
branded products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. Any failure to
appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_We may not have adequate remedies against our suppliers for defective merchandise and for unsatisfactory services,_**
**_which could damage our reputation and brand image, and harm our business._**

Any failure by our suppliers to adhere to product safety or manufacturing safety standards could result in serious
product defects that may not be detected by our quality control procedures, which may in turn lead to product recalls.
Although we or the injured party in question are able to make a claim against the supplier in the case of product defects
or warranty events, if the supplier defaults on their obligations, we may bear a portion of, and in some cases the primary
risk of, product liability and warranty claims. The reputation of our brand could be damaged by the marketing of
defective products, especially in the event of serious defects such as products containing harmful substances causing

32


-----

physical harm or other health problems. Such serious defects could also lead to a significant decline in sales. In addition,
there is a risk that compliance lapses by our suppliers could occur which could lead to investigations by agencies
responsible for international trade, health and safety or modern slavery compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement
actions could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. In all such cases, especially if there is a
prolonged impact on product quality, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow may be
materially adversely affected.

Additionally, if products that we purchase from suppliers are damaged or prove to be defective, we may not be
able to return products to these suppliers and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain other indemnification from
them. Our suppliers’ limited capacities may result in a supplier’s inability to replace any defective merchandise in a
timely manner, especially during peak selling seasons. In addition, our suppliers’ limited capitalization or liquidity may
mean that a supplier that has supplied defective merchandise will not be able to refund the purchase price to us or pay us
any penalties or damages associated with any defects, including the costs associated with removing and replacing
defective products and making associated repairs.

**_We may be unable to optimize our operational efficiency in accordance with our strategy and realize the cost savings_**
**_we are seeking._**

As part of our cost savings strategy, we are seeking to optimize our sourcing, branch network and organizational
and managerial structure. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively optimize our operational efficiency.
We will seek to realize significant cost savings in procurement, inbound and outbound logistics, centralized functions,
inventory range and management, size of our workforce, headquarters size and functions and information technology. In
order to realize these cost savings, we expect to incur material expenditures, which may be higher than our estimated
amount. Our anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement our cost saving
measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Furthermore, our ability to achieve the planned cost
savings is dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. We may be unable
to achieve these anticipated cost savings in a timely manner, if at all.

If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these cost saving programs proves to have been
incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or
realize in the anticipated time frame, the expected benefits from our cost saving measures. We may have to replace
headcount in certain areas of our workforce which might cost more than the current workforce and lead to a delay in
execution capability while the replacement workforce is recruited and integrated. Furthermore, pricing pressure from our
customers or competitors or other variables may deprive us of some of the anticipated long-term benefits from our cost
saving programs. Our new business initiatives could result in unintended consequences, such as the loss of customers
and key suppliers, a reduction in administrative or operational capabilities or collective action by our workers. Our
inability to realize the anticipated cost savings from our operational efficiency strategies could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

**_Our plans for improvement may not be successful._**

We are undertaking, or may undertake in the future, a variety of strategic projects throughout our business,
including enhancing our supply chain processes, improving our IT infrastructure, selectively acquiring complementary
businesses, establishing new facilities to grow our logistics platform, refurbishing existing branches and improving
overall customer experiences. These projects are intended to transform our infrastructure and data systems, increase our
cost efficiency gains and optimize our supply chain operations and our branch network. Strategic projects are often
complicated, interlinked and require considerable resources to deliver them. As a result, the expected benefits and the
costs of implementation of each project may deviate from those anticipated at their outset, which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

If our strategic projects are not successful, or require extensive investment, we may be unable to achieve or
maintain expected levels of profitability. Our strategy depends in part on continually growing our sales and increasing
our market share through the optimization of our branch network. As we pursue strategic acquisitions, failure to identify,
acquire and integrate suitable acquisition candidates on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse
effect on such growth strategy. We also cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to secure high quality real
estate to add to our freehold portfolio on terms and timelines acceptable to us. If our competitors are able to secure such
sites, they may be able to increase their market share in these areas and consequently restrict our ability to expand.
Additionally, we may experience difficulties securing new business space or refurbishing our existing branches due to
regulatory measures, such as approvals from regional or local planning authorities. Although we prepare investments in
our branches on the basis of detailed market research analyses which examine, among other criteria, catchment area,

33


-----

purchasing power, potential demand and competition, we may still face the risk of unsatisfactory sales performance at
our branches. Our market research analysis may prove to be inadequate, particularly due to factors that are difficult to
predict, such as customer behavior, or the data available may prove to be insufficient, such as in periods when market
conditions are changing. We cannot guarantee that any investments in our branches will yield the anticipated returns.
Our failure to build or refurbish our facilities, including branches, hubs and distribution centers, and meet customer
demand in a timely manner could result in a loss of business opportunities and damage to or loss of customer
relationships, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, we
cannot assure you that the opening of new branches, refurbishing of certain existing branches or integration of acquired
businesses will exclude the possibility of the diverting of sales from other of our existing branches, thereby reducing
sales in those branches. The growth and refurbishment of our branch network could place a strain on our management
systems, infrastructure and resources. In addition, such growth and refurbishment may prevent management from having
time to focus on their day to day activities. Any failure, or delay, in responding to these challenges or in implementing
our expansion strategy in a timely and cost effective manner could prevent us from remaining competitive and have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Moreover, reduced operating results could prevent us from obtaining the capital required to effect our
improvement strategy. We may be required to incur additional debt in order to consummate such plans in the future,
which debt may be substantial and may limit our flexibility in using our cash flow from operations. In the future, we
may be unable to arrange financing for our strategic plans on favorable terms, if at all. Consequently, we may not be able
to implement any improvement plans as anticipated, or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain qualified and motivated members of management_**
**_and employees while also controlling our labor costs._**

The successful operation of our business depends on the availability of skilled management and our continued
ability to attract and retain highly skilled, qualified and motivated employees in the areas of, for example, logistics and
distribution, customer service, IT, finance, procurement, marketing and research and development of our products. We
are in the process of implementing large-scale strategic initiatives, and are reliant upon certain members of our senior
management for the successful implementation of these initiatives and the execution of our overall growth strategy.
Even if we are able to attract new qualified members of management, we cannot ensure a smooth transition with respect
to the role of the successor. New management may alter our existing business plans or change our financial policies or
strategies for the future and may do so without as strong of an understanding of the results of our historical business
policies and strategies. We cannot assure you that any new strategies or business models adopted by any new
management will attract customers, or generate revenue or operating margins consistent with, or higher than, our prior
performance.

In addition, our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our employees.
To meet the needs and expectations of our customers and of the growth of our business, we must attract, train and retain
a large number of qualified and competent employees while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to
control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other
insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage or
healthcare benefits. If we are not successful in limiting such increases in labor costs or fail to mitigate such increases
through productivity gains or if cost increases cannot be passed on to our customers or only with a delay, this might have
significant negative effects on our financial condition and results of operations. However, an inability to provide wages
and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our profit margins.

In addition, we compete with other businesses for many of our key employees, particularly those positions with a
close personal relationship to our customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain suitable
employees in the future. We have previously lost certain key employees in Sweden when we did not adequately
incentivize our teams financially and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain key employees in the
future. A shortage of suitable employees could detrimentally impact our in-branch customer service and may
consequently result in reputational harm and adversely affect our results. If we are unable to retain qualified and
personable employees, particularly at the branch level, our customer services may be negatively affected and we may
lose repeat customers who have come to trust such employees’ in-branch advice and support to our competitors. We
cannot guarantee that contractual or other restrictions on existing employees will be enforceable or capable of preventing
such customers from moving to our competitors, which may lead to loss of business and adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_The properties at which we operate our branches, hubs and distribution centers are subject to certain permits and_**
**_licenses._**

The properties at which we operate our branches, hubs and distribution centers or at which we may operate new
branches, hubs and distribution centers are subject to certain permits and licenses from the applicable governmental
authorities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew such permits and licenses in a timely manner, or that the
permits and licenses that we have applied for will be obtained. In addition, we cannot assume that we will obtain such
permits and licenses in a timely manner for the opening of new branches, hubs and distribution centers. If we are unable
to renew or obtain such permits and licenses, we may not be able to open or operate a branch, hub or distribution center,
or we may be subject to certain penalties which vary from the imposition of fines to the termination of our business in
the respective properties, as the case may be. Such penalties, especially the termination of our activities in the properties
in which we operate our branches, hubs and distribution centers, may adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

**_The valuation of our freehold real estate portfolio may not be accurate or may decrease significantly and our_**
**_obligations under our leasehold real estate portfolio may be restrictive._**

As of September 30, 2017, we had a freehold real estate portfolio that was independently valued at up to
€805 million. Since the real estate market is affected by many factors, including but not limited to, general economic
conditions, interest rates, inflation rates, urbanization rates, household disposable income levels and supply and demand
dynamics, many of which are beyond our control, the valuation of our real estate portfolio may not be accurate. In
addition, the value of our real properties may depreciate. Should we be required to sell all or any portion of our
properties, including due to facing financial difficulties, in connection with an insolvency or otherwise, we may not be
able to sell our properties at favorable prices or on favorable terms, or the prices or terms offered by prospective
purchasers may not be acceptable to us. We may alternatively lease or sell the properties we own at rental rates or sales
prices below our expectation, and we may experience delays in the leasing or sale of such properties we own. Moreover,
the properties we own may not be as profitable as we expected and the maintenance costs of holding these properties
may exceed our capital expenditure budget and place a strain on our financial capacity. Any of the foregoing may
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

We also lease certain properties. We may be adversely affected if we experience any difficulty negotiating new
leases or renewing leases on commercially favorable terms. From time to time we may be unable to terminate leases
prior to their scheduled expiration without incurring a significant fee or financial penalty and may otherwise be unable to
sub-let a leased property or assign our rights under our leasing agreements. As a result, we may not be able to terminate,
sub-let or assign leases at our option, and in such circumstances, we may be unable to cease operating an unprofitable
branch or facility which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flow.

**_Our business is seasonal and could also be adversely affected by sustained periods of unfavorable weather._**

The B2B construction materials distribution industry provides customers with products used largely in RMI
activities and new build activities. These activities generally decrease during periods of inclement weather, and, as a
result, our operations can be characterized by weather-affected fluctuations in demand. Our revenue and net working
capital generally reflect seasonality in the building sector, and our most important trading period in terms of revenue,
operating results and cash flow has historically been in our first and fourth financial quarters as a result of increased new
build and RMI activity during warmer periods with longer daylight hours, among other things. In the winter months, we
typically generate less revenue due to low construction and renovation activity as a result of cold weather, partially
offset by an increase in indoor activities such as painting. Additionally, our results of operations are affected by
generally consistent seasonal swings in our net working capital. Typically, we experience a cash outflow in the winter
months as we tend to incur additional expenses in advance of our peak sales periods that occur during our first and
fourth financial quarters. We typically experience a cash inflow in the summer and early fall as we finalize collecting
payments from customers who have made purchases for their spring construction and renovation projects simultaneously
as we begin collecting payments from customers who are making purchases for their summer and early fall construction
and renovation projects. As a result of the seasonal nature of parts of our business, the financial results of a single
financial quarter may not be indicative of the financial results of a full financial year or may not be directly comparable
with the results of other financial quarters in the same year or in previous years. In addition, with respect to swings in
our working capital, from time to time our existing working capital financing may not be sufficient to meet our
obligations, and we may be required to either limit our business operations or obtain additional working capital
financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing at attractive rates or at all, or may be restricted under our
existing debt instruments in obtaining such financing. Any such inability to finance our net working capital requirements
could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

35


-----

Furthermore, climate change or changes in weather patterns could lead to the occurrence of more extreme
weather events or increase the frequency of extreme weather events in the future. Such adverse weather conditions could
increase the effects of seasonality on our business, especially if such events occurred frequently or for a prolonged
period of time, with an unusual intensity or during peak periods for RMI activities and new build activities. These and
other unfavorable weather conditions may result in unsold inventory, especially of seasonal merchandise, which is
difficult to clear without relying on promotional activities. Deliveries and service levels may also fluctuate based on
weather conditions. Any of the foregoing could materially affect our business, financial position, results of operations
and cash flow.

**_Our business is subject to increased transportation costs and could be affected by the disruption of transportation_**
**_services._**

Logistics is an important element of our cost structure. We transport products between our hubs, distribution
centers and branches and deliver products to our customers, relying on approximately 120 delivery trucks that we
directly operate and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs.
Any material disruption in, or lack of availability of, transportation or significant increases in fuel prices, road tolls or
demand-driven market prices resulting in higher transportation costs, as well as increasing costs relating to emissions
control requirements that have been or may be imposed in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In cases where we rely on third party-owned delivery
trucks, our ability to service our customers at commercially reasonable costs depends on our ability to negotiate
commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that third party-owned delivery trucks increase their rates, for example, as
a result of higher labor, maintenance, fuel or other costs they may incur, or due to other factors, such as capacity
shortages or consolidations, we may be forced to pay such increased rates without being able to pass through such
increased transportation costs to our customers. In addition, we are sometimes required to source products
internationally, and in such cases we may be subject to higher transport costs and may face a greater threat of damage to
our products during shipping, either of which may have a negative impact on our inventory costs and working capital.

Any material increases in our transportation costs that we are unable to pass on to customers fully or in a timely
manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
Furthermore, pursuant to our expansion strategy, we intend to open additional facilities, which may increase our
exposure to logistics costs and risks. Any increases in the cost of transportation or any disruption in transportation could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_We may face increasing prices in raw materials and fuel._**

We purchase and sell products that are made with, among other materials, wood or steel as part of our business.
The prices of many of these materials are volatile and set by international commodities markets. For example, prices of
wood products, including timber and panel products, are subject to significant volatility and directly affect our sales and
earnings as we have limited ability to manage the timing and amount of pricing changes for building products. If we or
our suppliers face increasing purchase prices for those materials, the prices we pay to purchase inventory may increase.
Suppliers normally seek to pass increased raw materials costs through to us, and may be able to do so depending on our
ability to obtain alternative supplies. In addition, the supply of building products fluctuates based on available
manufacturing capacity. A shortage of capacity or excess capacity in the industry can result in significant increases or
declines in prices for those products, often within a short period of time. If our suppliers are forced to close their
manufacturing plants or we are otherwise reliant on a more concentrated number of suppliers, we may experience higher
prices for our supplies and lower margins for our products. While we have historically been able to pass increased costs
on to customers, sometimes through contractual terms, we may be prevented from doing so in the future due to
competition, the need to uphold good customer relationships or other factors. Any increase in the prices at which we
purchase our inventory, particularly those exacerbated by lower margins on the products we sell, may adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Furthermore, higher prices for products involving fuel-intensive manufacturing and transportation processes
could also lead to an increase in the overall procurement costs for the finished products we stock. Increases in fuel prices
also affect the operating costs of our branch network and may only be offset to a limited degree through cost-saving
measures. If we are unable to pass on such costs to our customers, or only following a certain delay, we may face
declining margins. As we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with our customers generally, our attempt to
pass through higher raw material or other costs to them may lead to disruptions in such relationships or significant
decreases in the volume of products purchased, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow.

**_Our business operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises or other_**
**_catastrophic events._**

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and
climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist
attacks, war and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the Nordics or
internationally, could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our suppliers. In particular, these types
of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability to operate
our branches or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact customer or consumer spending in
the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally.

To the extent that such events were to result in a decrease in housing starts, the closure of one or more of our
branches or impair our ability to purchase, receive or replenish inventory, our operations and financial performance
could be materially and adversely affected. In particular, acts of terrorism could result in us experiencing a decline in our
revenue if customers are deterred from shopping in general or if one or more of our branches, due to their location, are
perceived to be particularly at risk from such acts of terrorism. In addition, any of these events could result in price
increases for, or shortages of, fuel, delays in opening new branches, and/or a temporary or long-term disruption to our
supply chain and ability to distribute products to our customers. In addition, these events can have indirect consequences
(such as increases in the cost of insurance) if they result in a significant loss of property or other insurable damage.
Moreover, our disaster recovery plans may be insufficient to cope adequately with such unforeseen circumstances. To
the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected.

**_We may encounter difficulties in our relationships with suppliers._**

We purchase our goods through a broad international network of suppliers and manufacturers. Our ability to
continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers and manufacturers who can satisfy our high
standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. We
believe that there are a limited number of reliable, high quality suppliers in the industry who are prepared to provide a
sufficient volume and quantity of products, and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative agreements or
arrangements in the future with suppliers, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Some
of our supplier contracts, for example, offer us better pricing depending on the quantity of supplies we purchase from
them. Any disputes with our preferred suppliers could limit our ability to maintain our quality standards and meet
customer demand for our products at favorable prices.

If our existing suppliers were unable or unwilling to continue to supply our needs, or if they were to be willing to
do so only at higher prices or on commercially unfavorable terms, our ability to provide materials, products and services
to our customers at competitive prices will be adversely affected. For example, our ability to obtain an adequate volume
and quality of timber, for example, could be affected by, among other things, forest fires, insect infestation, tree diseases,
prolonged drought, other adverse weather and climate conditions, and government regulations relating to forest
management practices, each of which may threaten our suppliers’ ability to perform their contractual obligations to us.
Since we may be unable to procure such materials and products elsewhere at short notice, we may experience supply
delays, and we may be forced to revise the terms, including the price, on which we supply products to our customers,
which could prompt our customers to purchase those products from our competitors. Additionally, if we become reliant
on a more concentrated number of suppliers for such materials, we may experience higher prices for our supplies and
lower margins for our products.

We have framework agreements in place with the majority of our suppliers and standard terms and conditions in
place for most other suppliers. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, approximately 17% of our sourcing spend
was incurred without a framework agreement in place. Where we have agreements in place, such agreements do not
usually contain minimum purchase or sales obligations for either party and may be terminable by either party on limited
notice. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could
put pressure on our operating margins or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow.

**_Our business and competitive position could be harmed if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual_**
**_property rights or if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information._**

Our business unit trademarks, namely STARK, Beijer and Neumann, and the trademarks for our own brand
products, namely Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics, are significant value drivers in our business. Third parties may in
the future try to challenge the ownership, scope and/or validity of our intellectual property. In addition, our business is

37


-----

subject to the risk of third parties infringing our intellectual property rights. We may not always be successful in
securing protection for or stopping infringements of our intellectual property rights. We may need to resort to litigation
in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and a
diversion of resources. Our failure to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition to intellectual property rights, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information in
operating our business. If this information is not adequately protected, then it may be disclosed or used in an
unauthorized manner. To the extent that consultants, key employees or other third parties apply technological
information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed products, disputes may arise as to the
proprietary rights to such information, which may not be resolved in our favor. The risk that other parties may breach
confidentiality agreements or that our trade secrets become known or independently discovered by competitors, could
harm us by enabling our competitors, who may have greater experience and financial resources, to copy or use our trade
secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies. The disclosure
of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position, thereby weakening demand for our products or services and
harming our ability to maintain or increase our customer base.

**_We may infringe or be alleged to have infringed intellectual property rights of third parties._**

It is also possible that we may infringe or be alleged to have infringed intellectual property rights owned by third
parties who may challenge our right to continue to sell certain products and/or may seek damages from us. Any
infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time consuming,
result in costly litigation, cause product delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. If successful,
such complaints could lead to products or services being withdrawn from our branches and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We have been and may in the future be subject to litigation._**

In the normal course of our business operations, we may be involved with legal proceedings initiated by our
customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties, both in court and out of court. See “Business—Legal
_Proceedings.” For example, on September 13, 2017, STARK DK was charged with an alleged bribery offense under the_
Danish criminal code relating to the payment in 2013 of DKK10,000 (approximately €1,500) by a former branch
manager of one of STARK DK’s Aarhus branches to a local badminton club at which a leading employee of Aarhus
municipality was a board member. The charges allege that STARK DK was hired as one of Aarhus municipality’s
suppliers in return for such payment. The branch manager in question as well as his direct supervisor left STARK Group
in 2015. According to the information currently available, it is our view that management of STARK DK, at the time of
the payment, was not aware of the former branch manager’s activities. Under Danish criminal law, in order to be liable,
STARK DK’s management at the time of the payment must have been aware of and sanctioned the activity of the former
branch manager. STARK DK is fully cooperating with the local police on this matter and intends to vigorously defend
itself against the allegations. In case of a conviction, STARK DK could be liable to pay a fine. While management
currently believes that the chances of a conviction of STARK DK are low, we cannot guarantee you that the case against
STARK DK will be dropped. Should STARK DK be convicted of the alleged bribery offense, we could be required to
pay a fine and our reputation may be harmed. We have been advised by external counsel that if a fine were levied, such
external counsel would not expect the fine to be more than the DKK10,000 in question.

Legal proceedings in which we may be involved, whether individually or in the aggregate, could involve
substantial claims for damages or other payments and, even if we successfully dispose of lawsuits without direct adverse
financial effect, such alleged claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and divert our financial and
management resources from more beneficial uses. If a court or arbitral body found us to be liable under any such claims,
the resulting litigation or arbitration expense and any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_Shop crime and fraud in our branches and on our online sales platforms may adversely affect our business._**

We seek to prevent shop crime and fraud in our branches and on our online sales platforms. Accordingly, in
recent years we have invested annually in training, security techniques, preventive measures and equipment such as
security cameras. Despite these efforts, shop crime and fraud continue as new methods of committing fraud continue to
be developed, including those performed by our employees. Fraud and other cyber-crimes may also target our online
sales platforms. There can be no assurance that continued or expanded efforts to counteract this trend will be effective or
that the cost of such efforts will not increase. Moreover, while we do not manage a significant amount of cash at the cash

registers in our branches, we cannot prevent the risk of experiencing shop crime and fraud due to, for example,
perceptions that we have high cash levels in-branch. The failure to control and reduce shop crime and fraud in a
cost-effective manner could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flow. In addition, any shop crime or fraud may give rise to litigation, which could be time consuming for our
management team, costly and have a material adverse effect on our reputation.

**_Any inability to update our information technology and/or a disruption in our information technology systems could_**
**_adversely affect our operations._**

Our business activities rely to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our IT systems,
particularly because our branches must record and process a substantial volume of sales transactions and inventory
management information quickly and accurately. The efficient operation and management of our business relies heavily
on a wide range of complex IT systems, both in terms of the availability of hardware and the efficient and effective
operation of software. The fast pace of technology advances together with our expansion has resulted in an increasing
demand for IT services, particularly as we develop new capabilities to supply products through new channels such as
phone and online based ordering. We rely upon our information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory,
to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, and to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and
services. Any significant disruption to the operations of our IT systems (arising from, for example, system capacity
limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages, or delays in our service) could significantly affect
our ability to carry out sales transactions in-branch, over the phone and online and could result in delays in receiving
inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our
systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic
break-ins, or similar disruptions affecting internet users. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or
associated costs and resulting loss in sales from a critical failure of our IT systems will not have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we currently rely heavily on certain longstanding key IT personnel, and if they leave their position with us or retire, we may not be able to find adequate
replacements in a timely manner.

The expansion and optimization of our existing operations will from time to time entail significant investments.
For example, we currently operate on a number of older IT systems, which may require replacement or significant
development and integration in order to support changes in business demand and in legislative requirements. In addition,
while we have historically had a fully in-house IT operation setup, we will be moving towards greater reliance on
external strategic IT partners. In connection with the Acquisition, we plan to outsource most of our IT services,
including, for example, hosting, support functions and application management services. The introduction and
integration of new software or upgrades require not only considerable investment but also skilled personnel, and may not
be successful or may take longer than initially anticipated. If we were not able to implement such new systems, if
required, in a timely and cost effective manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow
could be adversely affected. In addition, any significant disruption or breakdown in any of the systems at our external IT
partners’ facilities may result in a significant disruption of our operations and could significantly affect our ability to
manage our IT systems, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flow.

**_If we do not maintain the privacy and security of customer, employee, supplier or our business information, we could_**
**_damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation._**

In connection with our operations, we regularly store and handle personal information and purchasing
preferences of our employees, customers and suppliers, including personal data and credit card information. While we
believe we employ industry-standard methods for data security, our information systems have faced in the past, and may
face in the future, cyber attacks, and are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks, as
cyber criminals develop new ways to gain unlawful access to protected information systems. Any significant
compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of employee, supplier or customer
data, could significantly damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, employee, supplier or
business information, and result in significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. While we have implemented systems
and processes to protect us against unauthorized access to or to use of secure data and to prevent data loss, there can be
no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuse of the data.
Moreover, regulations related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy are becoming increasingly
rigorous in the countries and regions in which we operate, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to
our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.

**_Prolonged disruptions of business operations due to work stoppages or strikes could adversely affect our business._**

A significant part of our workforce is, and other members of our workforce in the future may be, represented by
unions. Although we believe that we have good relations with the labor unions that represent our labor force, we cannot
assure you that we will not experience a deterioration in our labor relations, resulting in strikes or other disturbances
occasioned by our unionized labor force. For example, labor unions may organize strikes if they disagree with our
business strategy. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that, upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining
agreements with the unions representing our labor force, we will be able to reach new agreements on satisfactory terms
or that we would agree on such new agreements without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. If our
workers were to engage in industrial action, our operations could be adversely affected and our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer material harm.

In addition, work stoppages or other disruptions of the business operations, strikes or similar measures at our
suppliers’ sites or any logistics provider could impact our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers.
Moreover, our customers, namely B2B customers, may enter into stricter union agreements that could impact their
operations and demand for our products and increase our cost base. Any of these events could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_Interruptions at any of our hubs or distribution centers or disruptions in our existing supply chain could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our operations._**

When we purchase products from certain of our suppliers, we take delivery of those products at our branches,
hubs or distribution centers before we arrange for their transportation to our branches for sale or delivery directly to our
customers. We rely on five ship hubs, one light-side hub, five central distribution centers and certain dedicated branches
for the storage and distribution of such suppliers’ products and to serve our overall network of branches in the Nordics.
Any major breakdown, disturbance or accident which affects any of our hubs and distribution centers may have a
material impact on the operation of our supply chain, which would adversely impact our ability to distribute products to
our branches and our customers in a timely manner and could affect our in-branch inventory and our ability to meet our
customers’ requirements. For instance, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with
distributing our products to our customers during the time it takes us to reopen or replace a damaged hub or distribution
center. In these cases, while we can rely more heavily on the dedicated branches that we utilize to store and distribute
our products, we would experience higher cost to serve and lower availability of stock due to the size and location of
these branches relative to our hubs and distribution centers.

Furthermore, because we source a portion of our products internationally, our logistics providers may encounter
issues associated with international shipping that could affect their ability to deliver our products on time or at all. For
instance, there may be delays or cancellations in the shipments of our products as a result of, but not limited to, natural
catastrophes, geopolitical issues, labor disruptions or any unforeseen failures in the operations or financial condition of
our third-party partners. Any delay in our shipments of products could affect our ability to offer our full product range.
Failures in our supply chain, such as those mentioned above, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_Our future growth and profitability depends on the success of, and the prevention of liability from, our advertising_**
**_strategy._**

We rely on advertising to increase customer and consumer awareness of our product offers and pricing and to
increase branch traffic. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of advertising platforms, including
digital and mobile devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable
laws and regulations on the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business or subject us to fines
or other penalties. Our future growth and profitability will depend in part upon the appropriateness, effectiveness and
efficiency of our advertising and marketing programs. In order for our advertising and marketing programs to be
successful, we must manage advertising and marketing costs effectively in order to maintain acceptable operating
margins and returns on our marketing investment, and convert consumer and customer awareness into actual branch
visits and product purchases.

Additionally, a large proportion of our revenue is generated by repeat customers. To further our relationship with
key customers and as part of our advertising strategy, we organize social events with certain customers who pay to
attend these events. In the future, if these advertising events become taxable or are perceived as excessive gifts or are
otherwise deemed to be unlawful incentives by the relevant authorities, this may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

40


-----

**_Compliance with or changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business._**

We are subject to and must comply with various directives by the European Union and other national and local
laws and regulations governing, among other things, advertising, product safety, timber sourcing, data protection,
intellectual property protection, health and safety, labor, building, environment, tax and other laws and regulations,
including consumer credit and consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances, which regulate
retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise. For example, we are subject to
various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations and although we believe that our facilities are in material
compliance with such laws, ordinances, and regulations, as owners and lessees of real property, we can be held liable for
the investigation or remediation of contamination on such properties, in some circumstances, without regard to whether
we knew of or were responsible for such contamination. No assurance can be provided that remediation may not be
required in the future as a result of spills or releases of petroleum products or hazardous substances, the discovery of
unknown environmental conditions, more stringent standards regarding existing residual contamination, or changes in
legislation, laws, rules or regulations. More burdensome environmental regulatory requirements may increase our
general and administrative costs and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Other applicable laws and regulations may also change or become more stringent, and consequently compliance
with these regulations could lead to increased costs, and violations of these regulations could result in damage payments,
substantial fines, the revocation of applicable permits, remediation costs for existing liabilities and increased costs for
future liabilities, and materially harm our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a tightening up of
zoning and planning regulations may limit our ability to expand our business and therefore adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow. Moreover, as we derive a portion of our turnover from public sector
related expenditure, changes in government policy that decrease governmental public sector spending, redirect material
purchasing directly towards the manufacturers, increase the requirements on suppliers or otherwise restrict the awarding
of government contracts could lead to a reduction in our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including our
effective tax rate or tax payments. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and
regulations. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these
laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to
pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes,
which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be subject to investigations or challenges with respect to our tax liabilities that may adversely impact
our results of operations. In addition, negative public attention regarding such investigations or challenges or our tax
structure in general could damage our brand or reputation.

From time to time, we are involved in discussions with tax authorities regarding our tax liabilities, which may
lead to a revision in our tax liabilities, and therefore impact our financial position. In such a case, we may be subject to
negative public attention, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation or relations with our customers,
employees, suppliers or other third parties.

**_Our results may be adversely affected by increases in the rate of value added tax or other applicable tariffs._**

Our results may be adversely affected by increases in the rate of value added tax (“VAT”) or other applicable
tariffs. VAT has historically increased and could increase further in the future or be expanded to cover products and
services not previously covered. To date, we have been able to pass on increased VAT costs to our customers by
increasing the prices of our products to match the increase in VAT. If we are unable to do so in the future, our
profitability margins will be negatively impacted. On the other hand, when passing the increase in VAT on to our
customers by raising the prices of our products, the demand for our products could decline.

In addition, we often rely on generally available interpretations of the regulation applicable to VAT and other
taxes and tariffs. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these
regulations. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the increase in the rate of VAT applicable to

41


-----

our activities or the imposition of additional taxes or tariffs could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect
or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations
or our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flow.

**_We are subject to currency exchange and inflation risk, which may adversely affect our financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because we source, either directly or indirectly, a
portion of our products from foreign suppliers and we generate revenue in euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona and
Norwegian krone. If the value of the currency in which the purchase price of our products is denominated increases
relative to the currency in which we generate revenue for such products, the profit margin for any such transaction would
be reduced.

Although we may engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to reduce our foreign currency exposure, our
hedging strategies may not adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, and
will reduce any benefit that we might otherwise have received from favorable movements in exchange rates. Inflation
and fluctuations in currency exchange rates may thus adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow.

**_We are subject to liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

We may be unable to obtain long-term financing for our investments for growth such as investments in our
branches, the procurement of large quantities of supplies or other investments from banks if financing conditions in the
capital markets change. If we become obligated to immediately repay any funds drawn due to a default under any
financing documentation, we would be required to obtain refinancing, which may only be available on stricter terms and
conditions. If any of the aforementioned risks materializes, this could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

In addition, trade credit from our suppliers is an important source of financing for the purchase of the inventory
we sell in our branches. Accordingly, the loss of, or a reduction in, trade credit (whether as a result of commercial,
financial or regulatory influences) could have a significant adverse impact on our inventory levels and operating cash
flow and negatively impact our liquidity. Our suppliers may seek credit insurance to protect against the nonpayment of
amounts due to them. If credit insurance is not available to suppliers at reasonable terms or at all, suppliers may demand
accelerated payment of amounts due to them or require advance payments or letters of credit before goods are shipped to
us. A negative change in our credit ratings or our suppliers’ perception of our creditworthiness, including due to pending
debt maturities, may impact their willingness to provide trade credit to us or the ability of our suppliers to obtain credit
insurance in respect of credit given to us. Any adverse changes in our trade credit for these or other reasons could
increase our costs of financing our inventory or negatively impact our ability to deliver products to our customers, which
may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

We provide the majority of our customers with short-term credit for which we carry the associated credit risk or
pass on to credit insurers. We also have supply arrangements with suppliers, which can result in them owing us
significant rebates. As such, we are exposed to the risk of credit default and generally risks of financial losses in
connection with financial investments and derivative financial instruments, which may increase if economic conditions
deteriorate. We endeavor to limit these credit risks by maintaining credit insurance and working exclusively with
contractual partners of strong credit worthiness and selecting banks covered by collective deposit security arrangements,
but we cannot exclude the possibility that one or more of our contractual parties may be unable to comply in part or in
full with the obligations entered into under financial instruments, which could in turn increase our premiums with our
credit insurer. If such a risk materializes, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

**_We are subject to certain competition and antitrust laws._**

Our business is subject to applicable competition and antitrust laws, as well as the rules and regulations of the
European Union. We may become subject to legal action or investigations and proceedings by national and supranational
competition and antitrust authorities for alleged infringements of antitrust laws, which could result in fines or other
forms of liability, or otherwise damage our business reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Such laws and regulations could limit or prohibit our ability to
grow in certain markets.

42


-----

**_Existing insurance coverage may turn out to be inadequate._**

We seek to cover foreseeable risks through insurance coverage. Such insurance coverage, however, may not fully
cover the risks to which we are exposed. This can be the case with insurance covering legal and administrative claims as
well as with respect to insurance covering other risks. For certain risks, adequate insurance coverage may not be
available on the market at all or may not be available on reasonable commercial terms. Consequently, any harm resulting
from the materialization of these risks could result in significant capital expenditures and expenses as well as liabilities,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_We are subject to liabilities in connection with our pension plans._**

Certain of our employees participate in defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. These pension
plans expose us to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, salary risk and investment risk. In addition, in
respect of contribution plans, changes in actuarial and financial assumptions used in determining the contribution level
may require us to increase our pension fund contributions in 2018 and beyond. In addition, in respect of defined benefit
plans, the majority of the plans’ defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation and an increase in inflation rates will
result in higher pension liabilities. At the same time, the majority of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by or only
loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation rates will also increase plan deficits. The majority
of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so that increases in life expectancy will result
in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. If we are required to increase our cash contributions to the pension scheme, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.

In Sweden, our Beijer business unit currently participates in collectively bargained defined contribution and
defined benefit pension plans for its white collar employees. Retirement pensions provided under the defined benefit
plan can be financed (i) through insurance contracts with a mutual insurance company, (ii) by accruing a liability for
promised benefits on the plan provider’s balance sheet and paying out pensions as these fall due or (iii) by making
contributions to an independent pension foundation. In the case of (ii) and (iii), a plan provider is obligated to take out
insolvency protection with PRI Pensionsgaranti, a mutually owned credit insurance and administrator of the relevant
defined benefit plan. Our Beijer business unit is currently accruing a liability for the promised benefits on its balance
sheet, which amounted to €48 million under IFRS as of July 31, 2017. In line with Swedish law requirements, Beijer has
taken out a credit insurance policy with PRI Pensionsgaranti. Beijer’s obligations to PRI Pensionsgaranti under the credit
insurance policy are guaranteed by Ferguson and secured by a floating charge over Beijer’s assets and business.
Ferguson’s guarantee will remain in place until the credit insurance policy is due for renewal in May 2018. In connection
with the Transactions, we have contacted PRI Pensionsgaranti and informed them of the anticipated change in ownership
of Stark Group. Following the consummation of the Transactions, unless otherwise agreed with them, PRI
Pensionsgaranti will remain the holder of the above mentioned floating charge and may also require additional or
replacement guarantees from one or more members of the Group, including the Issuer or one or more Guarantors, and/or
additional collateral, including over assets and properties constituting Post-Issue Date Collateral. PRI Pensionsgaranti is
entitled to cancel the credit insurance policy should they consider that they have not received satisfactory collateral or
should Beijer fail to provide additional collateral to PRI Pensionsgaranti’s satisfaction. Upon any cancellation of the
credit insurance policy provided by PRI Pensionsgaranti, Beijer would be required to subscribe to a mandatory pension
insurance policy with Alecta (the sole provider of the requisite pension insurance policies that could cover Beijer’s
pension liability), the cost of which could exceed 150% of the aggregate amount of Beijer’s incurred pension liabilities
and will be calculated by Alecta.

At the option of the Issuer, collateral and guarantees to PRI Pensionsgaranti, together with any other Pensionrelated Obligations, are permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank senior to our obligations
under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. See “—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—
_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit_
_Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and obligations permitted to be incurred on a_
_priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not control_
_decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes.” Additionally, in the future, Beijer may choose to, or may be_
required to (or another member of the Group may choose to, or may be required to) enter into one or more pension
insurance lines or similar agreements pursuant to which any pension liabilities (including liabilities to any pension
insurance provider, including, without limitation, PRI Pensionsgaranti) of any member of the Group incorporated in (or
under the laws of), or which liabilities are otherwise subject to, or governed by, the laws of, Sweden, may be guaranteed,
cash collateralized and/or extended any other credit support. Such future arrangements may be secured on the Post-Issue
Date Collateral on a priority basis with our obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

**_We are subject to risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures._**

In the future, to expand our business, we may pursue strategic acquisitions, business combinations and joint
ventures intended to complement or expand our business. Any future acquisitions, business combinations or joint
ventures by us could involve a number of special risks, including: the diversion of management’s attention and resources
to the negotiation, execution and assimilation of the acquired companies and their employees and to the management of
expanding operations; the incorporation of acquired products into our product lines; problems associated with
maintaining relationships with employees, suppliers and customers of acquired businesses; the increasing demands on
our operational systems; possible adverse effects on our reported operating results, particularly during the first several
reporting periods after such acquisitions are completed; and the loss of key employees and the difficulty of presenting a
unified corporate image. In addition, we may become liable for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to
discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with any future acquisition. Furthermore, we may not
be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions without substantial costs, delays or other problems, and the costs of
such integration could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we
may not be able to control any future joint ventures and therefore may be dependent on our respective joint venture
partners to cooperate with us in making decisions regarding the relevant joint venture.

From time to time, we also make divestments as part of our strategy. For example, during the year ended July 31,
2017, we divested our DIY brand, Silvan, in order to focus on our core business and customer groups. However, we
cannot assure you any divestments we have made or may make in the future will lead to positive growth for our
business. Such divestments could result in less revenue, write-downs of goodwill and a lower amount of total assets on
our balance sheet. We may encounter unanticipated events, costs or delays and retain or incur contract or legal liabilities
related to the divested business with respect to employees, customers, suppliers, independent agents, public authorities
or other parties. These divestments may also negatively affect our end-market and customer diversification and our
ability to meet our customers’ demand or to realize expected growth or cost savings, and may also increase our exposure
to cyclicality. The separation of the divested business may lead to delayed implementation of strategic initiatives of the
retained business.

In addition, we may also continue to reorganize our branch network as part of our optimization strategy. For
example, during the year ended July 31, 2017, we closed 30 underperforming branches in low growth regions. However,
we cannot assure you that such branch closures, or any future branch closures, will lead to positive growth for our
business. Such branch closures may negatively affect our end-market and customer diversification due to more limited
access to our products and services and our ability to meet our customers’ demand or to realize expected growth or cost
savings. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
of operations.

**_The interests of our current or future controlling shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the_**
**_Notes._**

The interests of our shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as holders of the
Notes. After the Acquisition Completion Date, the Sponsor will hold a controlling stake in our Group. As a result, the
Sponsor will have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our
day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve any other changes to
our operations. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain
material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The interests of the Sponsor could conflict with interests of holders of the Notes,
particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The Sponsor could also have
an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their
judgment, could enhance their equity investments although such transactions might involve risks to the holders of the
Notes.

**Risks Related to the Acquisition**

**_The Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks._**

On November 10, 2017, the Issuer entered into the Acquisition Agreement to acquire all of the issued and
outstanding share capital of the Target. We currently expect the Acquisition to complete in the spring of 2018. The
consummation of the Acquisition is, however, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance by the
competent merger control and foreign investment law authorities and the performance of certain closing actions. The
parties to the Acquisition Agreement will not consummate the Acquisition until the conditions are fulfilled, which may,

44


-----

potentially, take a number of months and, in exceptional circumstances, significantly longer. Certain subsidiaries or
assets of the Target may have to be sold or spun-off in order for the parties to the Acquisition Agreement to obtain
clearance by the competent merger control and foreign investment law authorities, which might lead to the loss of
operational benefits and might adversely affect the Group’s financial position. Accordingly, the parties may not be able
to undertake this transaction in a timely fashion, without remedies, or at all. Any such remedies may make the
Acquisition less attractive. The realization of any risks related to uncertainties of the Acquisition could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_The Issuer does not currently control the Group and will not control the Group until completion of the Acquisition._**

The Issuer will not obtain control of the Group until completion of the Acquisition. The Seller may not operate
the business of the Group during the interim period from signing of the Acquisition Agreement until completion of the
Acquisition in the same way that we would. Some information contained in this offering memorandum has been derived
from public sources and, in the case of historical information relating to the Group, has been provided to us by the Seller,
the Target and the Target’s subsidiaries. The Issuer and Bidco have relied on such information supplied to them in the
preparation of this offering memorandum. Furthermore, the Acquisition itself has required, and will likely continue to
require, substantial time and focus from management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the business.
Likewise, employees may be uncomfortable with the Acquisition or feel otherwise affected by it, which could have an
impact on work quality and retention.

In addition, prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, the Target and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the
covenants described in “Description of the Notes” to be included in the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that,
prior to such date, the Target and its subsidiaries will not take any action that would otherwise have been prohibited by
the Indenture had those covenants been applicable. Any of the risks associated with the Issuer’s lack of control over the
Target and its subsidiaries until the completion of the Acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

**_The Target’s historical financial information may not be representative of our future results._**

During all historical periods covered by the Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum, and
until the consummation of the Acquisition, the Target has been and will be wholly owned by the Seller. Accordingly, the
Target has no independent operating history that can be used as a basis for evaluating our financial condition, results of
operations and expected future performance following the Transactions. We cannot assure you that the risks and
challenges we face as an independent company, including planning or anticipating operating expenses, servicing our
indebtedness and obtaining financing on a stand-alone basis, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, our
financial position and our results of operations. The Target’s historical financial information included in this offering
memorandum reflects, among other things, fees paid to Ferguson in return for certain services as well as corporate
allocations for certain general and administrative expenses deemed to be attributable to the Target. However, these
allocations reflect the corporate general and administrative expense attributed to the Target as part of a larger
organization and do not necessarily reflect the corporate general and administrative expense that the Target would have
incurred had it been operating independently, including costs related to insurance, IT, finance and treasury functions.
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the Target and the other historical financial information included
in this offering memorandum do not necessarily indicate what our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows
or costs and expenses will be in the future.

**_The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is not intended to reflect what our actual_**
**_results of operations and financial condition would have been without the divestment of Silvan, the Branch Closures_**
**_and the Property Portfolio Adjustment for the periods presented and thus these results may not be indicative of our_**
**_future operating performance._**

We have no available historical financial information that reflects the divestment of Silvan or the effects of the
Branch Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment as the divestment of Silvan occurred during our financial year
ending July 31, 2018. We include the results of operation, financial position and cash flows from Silvan in our Financial
Statements as discontinued operations, which are shown separately from continuing operations in our Financial
Statements. In the future, we will report our consolidated financial results excluding Silvan.

The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business of the Target gives effect to the Branch
Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment as of and for the periods presented therein. The Unaudited Adjusted
Financial Information for the Ongoing Business has been prepared by management of the Target, including the
adjustments. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data” and “Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the

_Ongoing Business.” We believe the estimates and assumptions used to produce the Unaudited Adjusted Financial_
Information for the Ongoing Business are reasonable, but such estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate
over time. Accordingly, the historical and adjusted financial information included in this offering memorandum may not
reflect what our results of operations and financial condition would have been without the divestment of Silvan, the
Branch Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment during the periods presented, or what the results of operations
and financial condition of the Issuer will be in the future. Our first annual financial report describing the results of our
first fiscal year may not contain comparative data against the Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing
Business included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data” and

**_The Target is exposed to risks associated with the separation of its business from the Ferguson Group._**

The Target has operated as part of the Ferguson Group since 2006, during which time the Target has shared
certain functions with the Ferguson Group, including IT, governance, treasury, tax and insurance functions. The nature
and extent of functions provided on a Ferguson Group-wide basis, particularly about which the Target has limited
information or prior experience, may render the separation of the Target from Ferguson Group costly and timeconsuming and may diminish the amount of synergies we expect to generate from the integration of the Target business
into our own business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to replicate the shared functions provided under the
Ferguson Group on a stand-alone basis in a timely and cost-efficient manner or at all, including, for example, as a result
of the Target incurring costs related to sourcing dis-synergies as a smaller purchaser and in connection with employing
additional employees responsible for sourcing. In addition, the design and execution of the separation from the Ferguson
Group may require the devotion of substantial time and attention from management and key personnel and may have an
adverse effect on the conduct of normal business operations. The separation may increase the likelihood of operational
risks such as delays in bringing products to market, compliance risk such as ineffective internal controls and financial
risks such as reporting risks. Moreover, the design and execution of the separation may involve significant support from
external legal, tax, financial and other professional consultants and as a result, the Target may incur substantial costs.
Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to_**
**_redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in the Escrow Account pledged in favor of the Trustee for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, some of which are outside of our
control. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the business day immediately following the Escrow
Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption as described in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and you
may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the Notes.

The Escrowed Property will be initially limited to the gross proceeds of the Offering and will not be sufficient to
pay the special mandatory redemption price, which is equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date of special mandatory
redemption. In the event that the Escrowed Property is insufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, plus
any such accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, Lone Star Fund X will be required to make an equity
contribution in an amount required to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, owing to the holders of the Notes.

Your decision to invest in either series of the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or
financial position of the Target and its subsidiaries, or the terms of the Acquisition or the Financing, between the Issue
Date and the Acquisition Completion Date, may have an impact on our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to
rescind your decision to invest in the Notes as a result thereof.

**_The Acquisition may entitle our customers and certain other business partners of the Group to terminate their_**
**_agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**

The Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Target and its
subsidiaries. These counterparties will be entitled to terminate their agreements with us. Some of these counterparties
may exercise their termination rights, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
of operations.

**_Amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may have adverse consequences for holders of the Notes._**

The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement. The
Acquisition Agreement, however, may be amended and the closing conditions may be waived at any time by the parties

thereto, without the consent of holders of the Notes. Furthermore, any amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement
may make the Acquisition less attractive.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties that the Seller has_**
**_provided to us under the Acquisition Agreement._**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Seller has given certain customary representations and warranties in the
Acquisition Agreement related to their shares, the Target and the Target’s business. We may not be able to enforce any
claims against the Seller relating to breaches of these representations and warranties. The Seller’s liability under the
Acquisition Agreement is very limited. Moreover, even if we are able to eventually recover any losses resulting from a
breach of these representations and warranties, we may temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves.

**_We may have liabilities that are not known to us._**

There may be liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence
investigations into the Target and its subsidiaries in connection with the Acquisition. We may learn of additional
information about the Target and/or any of its subsidiaries that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent
liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

Following the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to
generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations on an ongoing basis. As of October 31,
2017, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had €515 million of outstanding indebtedness, comprising
the Notes. In addition, based on our current estimate of our cash flow and operations, we expect to draw on the
Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to meet our seasonal working capital requirements. See
also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting
_Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.”_

The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

     - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to either series of the Notes;

     - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

     - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal
of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, and limiting the ability
to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, joint ventures or
other general corporate purposes;

     - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

     - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as
highly leveraged; and

     - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes.

Furthermore, we experience significant fluctuations in our monthly and intra-month working capital and,
following the Acquisition Completion Date, we may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of our
working capital requirements. Drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility will vary and may be substantially higher
during certain months and weeks to compensate for months with reduced cash reserves.

47


-----

Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture, which could further
exacerbate the risks described above. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that with respect to a distressed disposal of,
or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such
Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other
future indebtedness and obligations permitted under the Indenture, including but not limited to, Pension-related
Obligations, have been repaid in full. Additionally, we could raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature
prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and
exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those
restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent
us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital
needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

     - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

     - create or incur certain liens;

     - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Issuer;

     - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

     - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

     - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to
and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries;

     - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

     - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

     - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

     - consolidate or merge with other entities;

     - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

     - amend certain documents.

All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and_
capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial test under certain
circumstances. Our ability to meet that financial test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure
you that we will meet it. A breach of this test could result in a default or an event of default under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject
to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the
availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or
cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving
Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our
subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which
would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay each series of the Notes, in full or in part. In
addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could enforce against any collateral granted to them to
secure repayment of those amounts.

48


-----

**_Despite our current indebtedness and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur_**
**_significant additional amounts of debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks_**
**_associated with our substantial leverage._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these
restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the
amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the
Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute indebtedness as such term is defined under those agreements, including, but not limited to, Pension-related
Obligations. Moreover, although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on
our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we will be able to make
substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances. Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt
levels or making restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage described above,
including our possible inability to service our debt.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not be able_**
**_to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit
Facility and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance
and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success of our business strategy as well as
general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors
discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated revenue growth, cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity
financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or
to fund our other liquidity needs, including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will mature six months prior to the maturity of the Notes. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility can be further increased, assuming we have the ability to
incur such additional debt under the restrictive covenants included in the Indenture. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of the Notes or any other debt that we may_
incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or
to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

     - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure;

     - sell assets;

     - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

     - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital-raising transactions
will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we
would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an
event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on any series of the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of
our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Notes, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may limit, and any future debt may
limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and
may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition
and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold
or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are
unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

49


-----

**_Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at floating rates_**
**_that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as well as the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at
floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR, CIBOR, NIBOR, STIBOR or LIBOR, depending on the
currency of the relevant loan, as adjusted periodically, plus a margin. Fluctuations in EURIBOR, CIBOR, NIBOR,
STIBOR or LIBOR, as the case may be, or the occurrence of a “market disruption event” (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement) may increase our overall interest burden and could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to service our debt obligations. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a
portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase significantly, our
interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of
national governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data
in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR or EURIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to
manipulate LIBOR or EURIBOR. Actions by EURIBOR-EBF (the association that sets the regulatory framework for the
calculation of EURIBOR), other regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which
LIBOR or EURIBOR is determined. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may
result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR or EURIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our
ability to service debt on drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Floating Rate Notes or any future
indebtedness that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_Our hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging counterparties fall_**
**_into bankruptcy._**

We are party to certain interest rate swaps and we may enter into additional interest hedging agreements to hedge
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes.
Under any such agreements, we are exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties
falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless.
Also, such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact
resulting from interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or
otherwise terminate hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a
loss.

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit_**
**_Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and obligations permitted to be incurred on a_**
**_priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not_**
**_control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances._**

Following the Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the same entities that also guarantee
the Revolving Credit Facility. Furthermore, other than the Escrow Charge, which will only secure the Issuer’s
obligations under the Notes, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-priority basis by the
same Collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, under the terms of
the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured
by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from
enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. The Indenture will permit and the Intercreditor Agreement permits currency
and interest rate hedging and certain other indebtedness incurred in accordance with the Indenture to be secured on a
priority basis.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first priority security interests securing the Notes are contractually
deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the extent that such security is expressed to
secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) certain obligations under hedging
arrangements and (iii) certain other future indebtedness and obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture,
including, but not limited to, Pension-related Obligations. Such security interests are, or will be, evidenced by security
documents for the benefit of (whether directly or through the Security Agent) the holders of the Notes, the lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the holders of certain other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the
Indenture. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of
the Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of
the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility,

50


-----

certain future indebtedness and obligations, including Pension-related Obligations, permitted under the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging
obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes, following the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving
Credit Facility, the Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other
creditor representative of future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security
interests. As a result, proceeds from the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees and the sale of Collateral may be
insufficient to pay claims under the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do
not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for the
secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security
Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) for the purpose of enforcement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

Creditors under Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) may have interests that are
different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such
entities securing such Notes and Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral described
in this Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement. We may increase the amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facilities or incur additional Super
Senior Liabilities, or liabilities ranking senior to the Super Senior Liabilities, permitted under the Indenture, as a result of
which the amount of indebtedness and obligations that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security interests
in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure
additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase
in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral.

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. There
is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under each
series of the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes
may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes.

The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. The fair market value of the Collateral at any point in
time may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry
conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon
many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies
in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the
ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there
may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant
portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. As a result, the book value of the Collateral should not be
conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or
enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. All or a
portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure
you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial
delay in our liquidation. In addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is
subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the
Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to
their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the

51


-----

Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of
any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the
extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant
guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any
challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce
the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral.

In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us.
Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or other Collateral or, if such market
does exist, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of this Collateral may
fluctuate over time.

**_The Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral and not all of the Guarantors will initially guarantee the_**
**_Notes._**

On the Issue Date, and upon completion of the Acquisition, the Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral,
as further described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured only by the
Escrow Charge. Additionally, on or prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, by first-priority interests in the Completion Date Collateral. Additionally, within no later
than (i) ten days from the Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured by first-priority security interests
in the Initial Post-Completion Date Collateral and (ii) 120 days from the Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will
also be secured by first-priority security interests in the Additional Post-Completion Date Collateral. There can be no
assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such liens within the time periods specified. The security
interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Revolving Credit Facility and otherwise as set forth under
“Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Security Interests,” which limitations could be significant. It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security interest_
granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such guarantee
or security interest may be subject to claw-back provisions under applicable local insolvency laws. See “Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by Bidco. We will agree in the Indenture, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, to use our commercially reasonable efforts take such necessary actions so that the PostCompletion Guarantors become guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture (or supplemental indentures) in the form attached to the Indenture on the earlier of (x) the date on which such
Post-Completion Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Revolving Credit Facility and (y) 120 days from the Acquisition
Completion Date. Management estimates that the Guarantors (other than Bidco) accounted for at least 80% of total
revenue for the Ongoing Business and at least 80% of Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended
July 31, 2017, and held at least 80% of our total assets as of July 31, 2017. Within 120 days following the Acquisition
Closing Date, subject to certain adjustments and the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer is required to ensure that the
Guarantors (other than Bidco) accounted for at least 80% of (i) total revenue for the Ongoing Business for the year
ended July 31, 2017, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017 and (iii) total
assets as of July 31, 2017. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such additional Notes
Guarantees within the time period specified. The additional Notes Guarantees will be limited to the same extent as those
under the Revolving Credit Facility and as otherwise set forth in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that
have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as
well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking
of security interests with respect to the Notes can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a
public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security Agent may need to

52


-----

obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be
able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when
required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose
upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further_

**_or other obligations in the future, may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may create hardening periods for
such security interests. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness or other obligations
permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the
Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances,
including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new
security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. Each
time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective
hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. To the extent that the
grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest.

The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the
accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets
and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor, as applicable, of the security. The liens on the
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take
the actions required to perfect any of these liens.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the
Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest
in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if not properly
perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the
debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the
security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges
is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created
on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the
appropriate register or by notification) may have priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation
or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of,
or to take steps or actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties.
See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and
_the Security Interests” for further information._

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent (on behalf of the holders of the Notes)_**
**_rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral_**
**_may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the relevant Notes
but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent, which will hold the Collateral on behalf of the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and our hedging obligations, the holders of the Notes and the holders of any additional debt
secured by Collateral permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide (along with the
Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a
consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement
action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of
the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests”_
for further information.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes. So long
as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among
other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the
Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course
cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of Notes under which the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will be_**
**_released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically. See “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of
_Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our subsidiaries as a result of an_
enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, then claims under the Notes and the Notes
Guarantees may be released or transferred. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Description of the Notes— Security—Release of Liens.” Your ability to recover on the Notes could be_
materially impaired in such circumstances.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in
connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes, if the Issuer has confirmed in writing to the
Security Agent that it has determined that it is neither possible nor desirable to implement any such refinancing on terms
satisfactory to it by instead granting additional Collateral and/or amending the terms of the existing Collateral. Such a
release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral.
Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the
validity and enforceability of the grant of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your
recovery in respect of such Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. See also “—The granting of the
_security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt or other obligations in_
_the future, may create or restart hardening periods.”_

**_Following the completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will have no revenue generating operations of its own and_**
**_will depend on cash flows from operating companies to make payments on the Notes._**

The Issuer does not have any revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations,
material assets (other than its shareholding in Bidco) or liabilities (other than those incurred in connection with its
incorporation and the Transactions). Repayment of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including under the Notes, is dependent on
the profitability and cash flow of its subsidiaries, including the Target and its subsidiaries, and their ability to make such
cash available to the Issuer, by dividend distributions, or otherwise. The subsidiaries of the Issuer may not be able to, or
may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness, or by law, in their ability to make distributions or
advance upstream loans to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of the
subsidiaries of the Issuer is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may
limit our ability to obtain cash from the subsidiaries of the Issuer. Furthermore, goodwill impairment and other non-cash
charges in our profit or loss account, as well as charges recognized directly in equity, if incurred, could reduce the
Issuer’s subsidiaries’ reserves available for distribution and thus reduce or prevent upstream dividend payments to the
Issuer.

While the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, respectively, will limit the ability of the
Group’s subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany
payments to us, such limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do
not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and
interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. We do not expect to have any other sources of funds that
would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor members of our Group._**

Some, but not all, of the members of the Group will guarantee the Notes. We expect the Post-Completion
Guarantors to be Beijer Byggmaterial Aktiebolag, DT Finland Oy, DT Holding (Sweden) AB, Neumann Bygg AS, Stark

54


-----

Danmark A/S and Stark Group A/S. Management estimates that the subsidiaries of the Target that will not be Guarantors
accounted for less than 20% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and less than 20% of Adjusted EBITDA for the
Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, and held less than 20% of our total assets as of July 31, 2017. Unless
a member of our Group is a Guarantor, such member will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes
or to make funds available for that purpose. The Indenture will, subject to some limitations, permit our non-Guarantor
restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial amounts of additional indebtedness and will not restrict the amount of other
liabilities that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of,
non-guarantor companies, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims
from the assets of such non-Guarantor companies before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or
any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

     - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such company; and

     - the creditors of such non-guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment
in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before any Guarantor, as a direct or
indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**_The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and_**
**_may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability._**

The Notes will be guaranteed by Bidco, which is incorporated in Denmark, and certain of our subsidiaries which
are incorporated under the laws of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, and will be secured by security interests
over the Collateral, which will be governed by the laws of these jurisdictions. The Indenture will provide that the Notes
Guarantees, and the Indenture and the relevant Security Documents will provide that the security interests, will be
limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed, or otherwise, or in respect of which security interests may be
granted, by the relevant Guarantor or grantor, as applicable, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security
interest, as it relates to that Guarantor or grantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law. See
“Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Security Interests.”_

In addition, enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor or security interests against any
security provider will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors or security providers, as applicable, in the
relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those
that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or
bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance,
set-off, counter-claim and prescription (time bar) or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or grantor of security interests may have
no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee or security interest, as applicable, depending on the amount
of its other obligations and applicable law.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws,
a court could (i) subordinate or void any Notes Guarantee or any security interest (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes
return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee or security interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or to
a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court
found that:

     - the Notes Guarantee or security interest was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors
or shareholders of the Guarantor or the security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient
was merely aware that the Guarantor or the security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant
Notes Guarantee or security;

     - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the
granting of the Notes Guarantee and/or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i) was

55


-----

insolvent or was rendered insolvent as a result of having granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security
interest; (ii) was under-capitalized or became under-capitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or
security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to
pay at maturity;

     - the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held to constitute prohibited
financial assistance;

     - the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held not to be in the best interests
or not to be for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider or was held to exceed the
corporate objects of the Guarantor or security provider; or

     - the aggregate amounts paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds under
the relevant security were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the
Indenture.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing
law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if:

     - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

     - the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay its existing debts and liabilities,
including contingent liabilities, as they became due; or

     - it could not pay its debts as they became due.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at
the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was
insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the
date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers
or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security
Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee or security interest not constituting a
fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can
be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each
Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee or security interest may be set
aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Notes Guarantee, or the granting of the security, was a
fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment
obligations under the Notes or such Notes Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void the security over
the Collateral, or could require the holders of the relevant Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes
or such Notes Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a
finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant
Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer, any other Guarantor or security provider, if
applicable, under any Notes Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been declared void.

Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to
Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as
debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the pledge or charge
permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or charge had not been given and a
bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within a certain time period following the
pledge or charge.

**_Enforcement of the rights of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture across multiple jurisdictions may be_**
**_difficult and the applicable insolvency laws may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the_**
**_Notes._**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, the
Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the Security Documents granting
security interests in the Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions. Moreover, the
Issuer and Bidco are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and Denmark, respectively, the other Guarantors are
incorporated under the laws of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland and the operational headquarters of the Group is
located in Denmark. Therefore, in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated
in these and other applicable jurisdictions. The rights of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture will thus be subject
to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and
costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. In
addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer,
Bidco and the other Guarantors may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors’
rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The
application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should
apply and could adversely affect the ability to realize any recovery under the Notes.

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and the_**
**_occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change of Control” (as defined in
the Indenture). Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding
Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient
funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of
the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A
Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other
indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even
if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay
cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing
financial resources. If we repay all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes in an amount over 50%
of the principal amount of the Notes in aggregate, we are required under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement to reduce the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility proportionately in accordance with the terms
of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control were to occur at a time when our Group is prohibited from
providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under
such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.
If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any
Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon
a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that our Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the
Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a
default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction
involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or
beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture. Except as
described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would
require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be deemed
not to be a Change of Control if a certain net consolidated leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the “Description
_of the Notes” is not exceeded in connection with such an event. In this case holders of Notes would not be entitled to_
require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and would only be able to rely on the then prevailing trading prices in order
to exit their investments, which might be lower than the 101% change of control repurchase price. See “Description of

57


-----

_the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Change of Control Triggering_
_Event.”_

The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted
subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether
the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.

**_Each series of the Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of relevant Notes unless and until
definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee) for
Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be
made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be
credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global form
and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the
Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, Transfer Agent, Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent or the Registrar will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to
Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the
Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests
for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including the enforcement of security for the Notes and the Notes
Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary (or its nominee) (as
registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you
have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We
cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote
on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted
to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry,
_Delivery and Form.”_

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

     - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

     - your ability to sell your Notes; or

     - the price at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investmentgrade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to
the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market
for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes
may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market
for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the

58


-----

Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an
active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of
the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application has been made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on
the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no assurance
can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the Official List of the Exchange, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of
the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in
the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact the
liquidity of the relevant Notes.

**_United States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Guarantors are incorporated
under the laws of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, and all of our assets are located outside the United States. In
addition, the majority of the members of our board and our officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may
be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing
outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in United
States courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in
jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon United States laws. See “Service of Process and
_Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”_

The United States and Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, Norway or Finland currently do not have a treaty
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. This may give rise to difficulties in respect of the enforcement in Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden,
Norway or Finland of judgments obtained in the United States. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil
_Liabilities.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that
payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to
the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A
credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any
given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating
assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and
conditions of our financings, and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws, which may affect their liquidity and_**
**_the price at which they may be sold._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United
States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. The Notes are not being offered
for sale in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any
Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the
Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal account of less than €100,000. We have not agreed to
or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (including by way of
an exchange offer). See “Transfer Restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and
sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_The interests of holders of Floating Rate Notes and the interests of the holders of Fixed Rate Notes may be_**
**_inconsistent and the interests of holders of additional notes under the Indenture may be inconsistent with the holders_**
**_of the Notes under the Indenture._**

The Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes will be issued pursuant to a single indenture and will vote as a
single class with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications of the Indenture other than with respect to
amendments, waivers or other modifications that will only affect the Fixed Rate Notes of a particular series or the
Floating Rate Notes of a particular series. The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate, will have a
different call schedule and call protection, and will have other features that will differ from the Fixed Rate Notes. As a
result of these differences, the interests of holders of the Floating Rate Notes and the interests of holders of the Fixed
Rate Notes could conflict. In addition, the holders of one series of Notes may be in a position to agree to certain terms in
a consent solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of Notes but adverse to the economic interest of the other
series of Notes; however, to the extent the relevant amendment or waiver is approved by the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (subject to the limited exceptions described above), all holders
of the Notes will be bound by such amendment. Furthermore, a series of additional notes may be issued under the
Indenture that have different terms in respect of currency, interest rate, maturity, call schedule and other matters. Such
additional notes will also generally vote as a single class with other series of notes issued under the Indenture, but may
have interests that differ from the holders of other series of notes issued under the Indenture, including the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to
a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other
factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which such investors
measure the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which
we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the
return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and
could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such
investors measure the return on their investments.

**_The interests of our sponsor may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Lone Star Fund X indirectly owns the majority of the shares of the Issuer. As a result, the Sponsor has and will
continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure, as well as the ability to elect
and change our management, approve other changes to our operations and influence the outcome of matters requiring
action by our shareholders. The Sponsor’s interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as holders
of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example,
Lone Star Fund X could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness or to sell certain lines of business or other
assets of the Group. If the Group achieves certain net leverage ratios following an asset sale, the Group may dividend the
proceeds of such sale to Lone Star Fund X without first reducing the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, the
Revolving Credit Facility or other indebtedness of the Group. The Sponsor is in the business of making investments in
companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our Sponsor
may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, the Sponsor may in the future hold interests in suppliers or
customers of the Target. The Sponsor and its affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures
(including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business, certain business segments, or sales of our shares which
would result in changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in
their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder
of Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be approximately €515 million. Pending
the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering into the
Escrow Account. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” On or prior to
the Acquisition Completion Date, the Sponsor will provide the Shareholder Funding in order to pay part of the
consideration payable for the Acquisition.

Bidco and the Issuer intend to use the gross proceeds from the Financing, together with the Shareholder
Funding, to (i) fund the purchase price for the Acquisition, (ii) fund cash to the balance sheet of the Target for general
corporate purposes and (iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including estimated fees
and expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering.

In connection with the Transactions, the Issuer will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to
provide for a Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of €100 million to finance our general corporate and ongoing
working capital needs.

The sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the table below
assuming the Acquisition Completion Date had occurred on October 31, 2017. Actual amounts will vary from the
amounts shown in this table depending on several factors, including the actual Acquisition Completion Date and
differences from our estimates of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions. Pursuant to the completion
account mechanism in the Acquisition Agreement, Lone Star Fund X will acquire the Target on a cash-free and debt-free
basis, and the actual purchase price for the Acquisition will be determined based on the actual level of assets and
liabilities, including net debt, debt like items and net working capital, of the Target on the Acquisition Completion Date.
As a result, the actual purchase price for the Acquisition will depend on the timing of the Acquisition Completion Date
and may be higher or lower than the estimated purchase prices as of October 31, 2017.

(1) Represents the Shareholder Funding, comprised of an equity contribution and deeply subordinated shareholder debt, which will be contributed
and/or on-lent by Lux Holdco to the Issuer. The Shareholder Funding will include the proceeds from the private placement of €100 million
aggregate principal amount of PIK Toggle Notes to be issued by PIK Holdco on or about the Acquisition Completion Date.

(2) Represents the purchase price for the Acquisition as if the Acquisition Completion Date had occurred on October 31, 2017, and assumes that the
Target’s cash, net debt and debt like items on the Acquisition Completion Date will be equal to the Target’s cash, net debt and debt like items as
of October 31, 2017 and that the Target’s net working capital on the Acquisition Completion Date will be equal to the average net working
capital of the Target for the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, in each case, as calculated under the Acquisition Agreement. The actual
purchase for the Acquisition may vary depending on several factors including the actual cash, net debt, debt like items and net working capital
position of the Target on the Acquisition Completion Date. Based on our current estimate of our cash flow and operations, we expect to draw on
the Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to meet our seasonal working capital requirements. We anticipate that we will
repay such drawings in the subsequent months as our working capital requirements decrease. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.”_

(3) Represents the amount of cash expected to be funded to the Target’s balance sheet in connection with the Transactions, which will be used for
general corporate purposes, including, among other things, funding future capital expenditures and acquisitions, the payment of interest or the
repayment of debt.

(4) Includes estimated expenses in connection with the Transactions, including discounts, commissions and commitment, placement, advisory and
other fees related to the Notes and Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent the Notes are issued with original issue discount, the amount of fees
and expenses will increase. This amount may differ from the estimated amount depending on several factors, including differences from our
estimates of fees and expenses and the actual fees and expenses as of the completion of the various transactions referred to in the table above.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and capitalization (i) of the Target as of
October 31, 2017, on a historical basis and (ii) of the Issuer as adjusted for the Ongoing Business and after giving effect
to the Transactions (including the use of proceeds from this Offering), as if the Transactions had occurred on October
31, 2017. We believe that presenting the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and capitalization of the Issuer in this
manner is the most meaningful way to present the financial position of the Issuer after giving effect to the Transactions
as if they had occurred on October 31, 2017, given the Issuer is a holding company formed in connection with the
Transactions with no revenue generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations, material assets
or liabilities (other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions).

The table below should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and Other Data,” “Summary—
_Summary Historical Financial Information, Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business and_
_Other Financial Data,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and our Financial Statements_
and related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(1) The adjustments to cash and cash equivalents reflect the movement in cash and cash equivalents as a result of the transactions set forth under
“Use of Proceeds,” and reflect that Lone Star Fund X will acquire the Target on a cash-free and debt-free basis. As adjusted cash and cash
equivalents of the Issuer as of October 31, 2017 does not include any adjustments to the Target’s cash and cash equivalents due to working
capital expansion or contraction or any other cash utilization since October 31, 2017. As a result, our actual cash and cash equivalents on the
Acquisition Completion Date may be higher or lower than shown in the table above.

(2) Represents bank overdrafts and secured bank loans relating to Danish mortgages, which will be repaid in connection with the completion of the
Transactions pursuant to the closing account mechanism in the Acquisition Agreement.

(3) Represents the €100 million Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to be entered into on or about the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Based on our current estimate of our cash flow and operations, we expect to_
draw on the Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to meet our seasonal working capital requirements. See also
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—
_Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.”_

(4) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes is stated gross of any capitalized issuance costs.

(5) Payables to related parties will be repaid in connection with the completion of the Transactions pursuant to the closing account mechanism in
the Acquisition Agreement.

(6) As adjusted share capital reflects the Issuer’s nominal share capital of €30 thousand and €585 million of Shareholder Funding assuming the
Shareholder Funding consisted entirely of an equity contribution. We expect the Shareholder Funding to comprise both an equity contribution
and deeply subordinated shareholder debt.

**SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following tables present selected historical financial data for the periods ended on and as of the dates
indicated below. We have extracted the consolidated historical financial data of the Target as of and for the three months
ended October 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, from the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and the consolidated
historical financial data of the Target as of and for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 from the relevant
Audited Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

On July 10, 2017, in connection with our strategy to refocus our ongoing business operations primarily on B2B
customers, we announced our agreement to divest our DIY brand, Silvan, to Aurelius Group. The sale of Silvan
concluded on August 31, 2017. Additionally, we divested our Cheapy chain, a Swedish discount chain, which was sold
in April 2014, and Oscar Perschard, a small Norwegian branch, which was sold in July 2014. We include the results of
operation, financial position and cash flows from Silvan, Cheapy and Oscar Perschard in our Financial Statements as
discontinued operations, which are shown separately from continuing operations in our Financial Statements. In this
offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, references to any financial data are only to financial data from
continuing operations and exclude the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Silvan, Cheapy and
Oscar Perschard.

Prospective investors should read the summary data presented below in conjunction with, and the summary data
presented below is qualified in their entirety by reference to, “Presentation of Financial and Other Data,” “Use of
_Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations” and the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**UNAUDITED ADJUSTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE ONGOING BUSINESS**

The following Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is presented to illustrate the
impact of the Branch Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment on the Target’s historical financial information.
For a description of the Branch Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment, see also “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Data.” The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is based on, and should be read_
in conjunction with, our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and the section entitled
“Selected Historical Financial Information.”

In particular, the Unaudited Adjusted Income Statement Data for the Ongoing Business for the three months
ended October 31, 2016 and 2017, and the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017 is adjusted to give effect to the
transactions described below, as if they occurred at the beginning of the respective period:

     - our closure of 30 underperforming branches and sale of our Sanvold business in (i) Denmark in January
2017 (14 branches), (ii) Finland in January 2017 (8 branches), (iii) Norway in March 2017 and (iv) Sweden
in April 2017 (7 branches) (the “Branch Closures”); and

     - an adjustment of the Target’s property portfolio to exclude certain operational properties in Denmark and
Norway, a distribution center in Finland, the headquarters in Copenhagen and 30 vacant properties, which
have historically been included in the Target’s financial results but do not form part of the Target’s ongoing
business that will be acquired by Lone Star Fund X in connection with the Acquisition (the “Property
Portfolio Adjustment”).

In addition, certain other financial information is adjusted to add back amortization of acquired intangible assets,
impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets, items that management considers to be exceptional and certain
other items that management considers to be non-recurring.

The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is not presented in accordance with
IFRS and has been derived by applying certain adjustments to the line items included in the Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We present the Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the
Ongoing Business because we believe that it reflects more closely the Target’s business that will be acquired by Bidco in
connection with the Transactions and thus provides additional information of the Target’s historical performance and
financial position of the businesses and operations to be acquired. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the
Ongoing Business may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as
analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as
reported under IFRS.

The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business reflects the application of adjustments
that are based upon available information and certain assumptions, as described above, that management believes are
reasonable under the circumstances. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is
presented for informational purposes only. Actual results may differ materially from the assumptions within the
accompanying Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the
Ongoing Business has been prepared by management and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that
would have been realized had the transactions contemplated above as of the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be
indicative of any future results of operations that we will experience going forward.

write-offs, staffing and bonus payments. We consider such costs to be exceptional.

(ii) Restructuring represents consulting and advisor fees incurred in connection with restructuring our head office and STARK
FI, which we consider to be non-recurring costs.

(iii) The profit/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment relates to the gain on sale of our Cheapy chain, a Swedish
discount chain, in Sweden during the year ended July 31, 2016 and the loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment in
Denmark.

(iv) The profit on disposal of businesses represents adjustments to provisions in respect of prior year disposals by STARK FI.

(b) Ferguson Group management fee represents certain charges to us by Ferguson for historical Ferguson

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing_
_Business based on the Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business. Please also refer to_
_“Presentation of Financial and Other Data.”_

_You should read this discussion in conjunction with the Financial Statements of the Target, included the notes_
_thereto, included elsewhere in the offering memorandum as well as the information set forth in “Summary—Summary_
_Historical Financial Information, Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business and Other_
_Financial Data,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and “Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the_
_Ongoing Business.” A summary of the critical accounting estimates that have been applied to the Target’s financial_
_statements is set forth below in “—Critical Accounting Judgments.” This discussion also includes forward-looking_
_statements which, although based on assumptions that we consider reasonable, are subject to risks and uncertainties_
_that could cause actual events or conditions to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking_
_statements. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties facing us as a result of various factors, see “Risk Factors.”_

**Overview**

We are the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics. We directly operate a total of 179 branches
across Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Greenland from which we serve our diversified customer base of small
and medium-sized enterprises, which comprise our core customer group, as well as large construction companies, private
consumers and other types of customers, such as public authorities.

We operate four business units across the Nordics and as of October 31, 2017, we directly operated 66 branches
in Denmark, with an additional six branches in Greenland, under our STARK DK business unit, 27 branches in Finland
under our STARK FI business unit, 66 branches in Sweden under our Beijer business unit and 14 branches in Norway
under our Neumann business unit. Our customers primarily purchase our products for use in the resilient RMI market
which has shown stable growth during 14 out of the past 17 years across the Nordic region. In the twelve months ended
October 31, 2017, management estimates that we generated approximately 60% of total revenue for the Ongoing
Business and approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from RMI activities and approximately 40%
of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from new
build activity.

As of October 31, 2017, we had 5,056 FTEs and a total headcount of 5,667 personnel, and in the twelve months
ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue for the Ongoing Business of €2,183 million and Run-rate Adjusted
EBITDA for the Ongoing Business of €109 million, and achieved a Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Ongoing
Business of 5%.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Various factors affect our operating results during each period, including, but not limited to:

**_General Economic Conditions and Activity in the Construction Industry_**

The construction materials distribution industry and demand for our products in our markets is dependent on the
level of activity in the construction and renovation sector in these markets. Total construction and renovation activity
includes RMI as well as new build activity. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, management estimates RMI
activity accounted for approximately 60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 75% of gross
profit for the Ongoing Business, and new build activity accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue for the
Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business. The level of construction and
renovation activity in the Nordics is cyclical in nature and is dependent on the level of construction- and renovationrelated expenditures in the residential, industrial and commercial sectors, public investments and public and private
spending on infrastructure projects. Such construction- and renovation-related expenditures are particularly sensitive to
factors such as GDP growth, interest rates, cost and availability of mortgage financing for residential, commercial and
industrial construction and renovation, inflation, consumer and producer confidence as well as other macroeconomic
factors. Political instability, changes in government policy, increased immigration and urbanization may also affect the
construction and renovation industry. As a result, cyclical fluctuations in the construction and renovation industry has
historically affected our sales and gross margin. Historically, RMI activities across the Nordics have exhibited structural
resilience through the economic cycle and has shown stable growth during 14 out of the past 17 years, which has in the

70


-----

past contributed to stable revenue generation and gross margins. RMI activity is more resilient to cyclical fluctuations
than new build activity and primarily driven by the need to modernize existing housing stock. In the past, RMI activity
has generated a larger proportion of our revenue during economic downturns due to delays or temporary interruptions in
the new build industry.

**_Trends in the Construction and Renovation Industry_**

Our results of operations are affected by general trends in the construction and renovation industry, including an
increase in the number of private consumers hiring SMEs for RMI activity, the growing trend towards urbanization, an
ageing population, increased own brand penetration and other key trends. We estimate that SMEs accounted for
approximately 50% of the gross profit pool in the construction materials distribution industry across the Nordics in 2016,
which is forecast to grow at a faster rate than the overall construction materials distribution market between 2016 and
2021 according to a leading management consulting firm. We consider SMEs to be our core customer group, accounting
for approximately 56% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business in the year ended July 31, 2017. Consequently, our
business is benefitting from a continuing increase in the number of private consumers hiring SMEs for RMI activity
rather than completing RMI works themselves, which has led to stable sales to SMEs during the last three years. This
trend has historically been supported by government tax incentives on home improvements in Denmark and Sweden,
including, for example, the ROT tax subsidy in Sweden, which allows for a tax deduction of up to 30% of the labor costs
incurred in relation to RMI works carried out on one’s property, which incentivizes private consumers to hire SMEs for
RMI activity. In addition, we believe our business is well-positioned to benefit from growing urbanization trends,
particularly given our footprint is strategically skewed toward attractive growth areas. A leading management consulting
firm expects the growth of urbanization to lead larger geographic regions and cities to outgrow the rest of the market and
increase demand for both residential and non-residential RMI and new build activities in such regions. Changing
demographics also affect our results of operations, as an aging population tends to lead to a shift away from DIY toward
the hiring of SMEs and other of our B2B customers for new build and RMI needs. Management believes since wealth
may increase with age, an older population may also be more able and willing to spend on new build and RMI activities
than a younger population. In addition, our results of operations are affected by increasing own brand penetration across
the Nordics as own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on average than branded SKUs, according to management
estimates. We currently offer our customers approximately 4,110 own brand SKUs. Based on independent market
studies, we estimate that own brand products currently hold approximately 10% of the relevant market share in the
Nordics, and we expect such market share to double by 2020.

**_Our Ability to Effectively Compete with Other Building Material Distributors_**

Competitive pressure from other building material distributors affects our ability to attract customers in the
markets in which we operate, and may result in reduced sales volumes and pricing pressure and require us to make
additional capital expenditures to upgrade branches or incur additional costs, for example relating to staff numbers or our
logistics and distribution network, as we seek to provide more competitive products and services. Given our scale, we
believe that we benefit from significant operational advantages compared to our competitors, which are mostly “mom
and pop” shops collaborating in buying groups or franchisee-owned operations, which generally cannot match the
combination of our harmonized sourcing capabilities across the Nordics, collaborative customer service network and
convenient national and cross-regional product availability. Additionally, operating a company-owned network of
branches allows us the opportunity to leverage our scale to provide flexible collection and delivery services on a national
and cross-regional basis, thus reducing infrastructure and fleet costs, as well as operate at better sourcing and working
capital levels than our competitors by harmonizing our product assortment across branches. Furthermore, in order to
enhance customer loyalty, we have implemented a customer discount and loyalty bonus system across certain of our
business units pursuant to which we offer favorable pricing terms and purchasing conditions to, for example, repeat
customers whose total purchase spend with us is high, which may affect our revenue and gross margin. We also provide
credit to a majority of our customers, which for many is an essential criteria for purchases. We mitigate the potential
risks for providing credit to our customers through credit insurance and our credit control team.

**_Product Pricing, Product Mix and Supply Costs_**

The price of our products has a direct impact on our revenue and is dependent on, among other things, general
economic conditions and pricing pressure from our competitors in the markets in which we operate. If pricing
competition increases, we may sell fewer products than expected or we may sell these at lower prices, which could affect
our revenue and gross margin. We have introduced our smart pricing strategy pursuant to which we have implemented
consistent shelf prices. In addition, to facilitate movement in inventory, we have established pricing structures under
which we offer discounts on certain trade-specific “high runner” products, competitive prices for items purchased
frequently and fairer prices for items purchased infrequently. We believe our smart pricing strategy enhances brand and
value perception among our customers to further drive sales growth.

Our results of operations are also affected by the type of products that we sell and the type of construction
activity for which these products are used by our customers. For example, products such as timber, concrete and
insulation materials, which customers may use for new build activity, can generate lower margins than products such as
paints, tiles, sealants, sand paper and adhesives, which customers may use for RMI activity. Furthermore, as of
October 31, 2017, we offered our customers 4,110 own brand SKUs and are currently in the process of building a
strategic common core range of 800 SKUs for our own brand portfolio. Own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on
average than branded SKUs, according to management estimates. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we
derived approximately 91% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from branded products and approximately 9% of
total revenue for the Ongoing Business from own brand products. Compared to the three months ended October 31,
2016, our own brand products generated approximately 31% more revenue for the Ongoing Business in the three months
ended October 31, 2017, according to management estimates. As a result, increased sales of own brand products may
positively affect our gross margin.

Moreover, our results of operations are affected by our ability to source our products at competitive prices.
Leveraging our scale, our business benefits from our harmonized sourcing capabilities across the Nordics which allow us
to reduce costs and increase our gross margin by maximizing purchasing power through rationalizing our supplier base
and creating performance-based supplier contracts.

Furthermore, our results of operations are affected by our customers’ preferences for our sales channels. Our
stock collected channel typically generates higher gross margins due to a higher margin product mix and value-added
potential from large product assortment and availability within branches, as well as higher exposure to higher margin
RMI activities. Our direct delivery channel typically generates lower gross margins, as large order volumes can lead to
discounts and lower purchasing power with manufacturers and as this channel typically has higher exposure to lower
margin new build activities. Our stock delivered channel typically generates variable gross margins depending on the
country of operation and type of customer contract, including as a result of mixed exposure to RMI and new build
activities. As a result, an increase in sales through our stock collected channel may positively affect our gross margin.

**_Flexibility of Our Cost Structure_**

Our cost structure has historically provided us with significant downside protection during periods of adverse
economic conditions. Given the intrinsic nature of a distributor business, approximately 90% of our cost base is either
directly linked to sales (such as cost of sales and fleet costs), or is considered by management to have a high potential for
short-term right-sizing (such as employee benefits expenses related to employees with flexible contracts and fleet costs).
Our fixed costs mainly relate to the fixed portion of our employee benefits expenses, including our base employee and
pension costs, administrative expenses and other fixed costs, such as costs related to IT functions. Additionally, we have
historically been able to further adjust our cost structure during economic downturns by rationalizing discretionary costs
related to advertisement, infrastructure, administration and IT. Furthermore, the downside protection offered through our
variable cost structure is partially due to our large freehold portfolio of 195 properties independently valued at up to
€805 million as of September 30, 2017. Given the large portion of owned branches, our business benefits from low
impact from rent expenses on our cash flow when compared to our competitors across Europe as we do not have a fixed
monthly cash outflow with respect to such rent expenses. In the year ended July 31, 2017, management estimates that
external rent accounted for only 14% of our EBITDA for the Ongoing Business. By contrast, external rent represented
approximately 20% and 37% of EBITDA for Ahlsell and Byggmax, respectively, during each of their 2016 financial
years. Additionally, the rigorous management of our working capital and our flexible capital expenditure levels, have
historically allowed us to generate significant cash flows, resulting in a cash conversion rate, defined as Adjusted
EBITDA for the Ongoing Business less adjusted capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing
Business, of 72%, 70% and 61% for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

**_Management of Foreign Exchange_**

Our key operating currencies are the euro, Danish krone, which is pegged to the euro, Swedish krona and
Norwegian krone. Our revenue and costs, including sourcing costs, for each business unit are primarily in the respective
local currency, which offers natural hedging opportunities. We also have limited exposure to foreign exchange risks in
connection with the U.S. dollar as we source some of our own brand products from China in U.S. dollars. In addition, we
sometimes source certain of our products for our Beijer branches from Denmark, exposing us to limited foreign
exchange risks between the Danish krone and Swedish krona, while at the same time reducing our exposure to Swedish
krona and increasing our exposure to Danish krone, which is pegged to the euro.

**_Management of Capital Expenditures_**

We incurred €37 million, €28 million and €55 million of Capital Expenditures for the Ongoing Business in the
years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, of which €33 million (1.6% of revenue for the Ongoing
Business), €20 million (0.9% of revenue for the Ongoing Business) and €53 million (2.5% of revenue for the Ongoing

72


-----

Business), respectively, related to purchases of land, property, plant and equipment and €4 million (0.2% of revenue for
the Ongoing Business), €8 million (0.4% of revenue for the Ongoing Business) and €2 million (0.1% of revenue for the
Ongoing Business), respectively, related to purchases of intangible assets.

Maintenance capital expenditures typically relate to branch refurbishment in connection with improving our
customer offer and space allocations and IT expenditures. As of September 30, 2017, we had a freehold property
portfolio comprising 195 properties, including 153 properties at which we operate branches, eleven properties in
Denmark shared with Silvan and other properties. Our freehold property portfolio allows us discretion in our capital
expenditures, as we can decide on the amount and timing of our maintenance capital expenditures. The scope and related
investment associated with branch refurbishments varies by the size and category of the physical branch as well as its
general condition, and we generally target a payback on investment within three to four years.

Expansion capital expenditures have historically comprised one-off expenditures related to the development of
new branches, the acquisition of the freehold of existing branches and our distribution center.

In connection with the completion of the Acquisition, we expect to incur expenses related to replicating certain
functions, such as stand-alone insurance, IT, finance and treasury functions, that we have previously shared with
Ferguson on a Group-wide basis. In addition, in connection with our strategy to optimize the footprint of our branches in
above market growth areas, we may in the future selectively acquire freehold properties in strategic locations across the
Nordics. Costs incurred in improving and/or expanding our property portfolio are generally capitalized and then
depreciated in line with IFRS.

As we continue to invest in the improvement and optimization of our branch network, including through the
consolidation of our branches and any selective bolt-on acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, capital
expenditures and costs associated with the depreciation of the corresponding capitalized costs will likely increase.

**_Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods_**

Our business activities are cyclical and are subject to significant seasonal influences. Our revenue and net
working capital generally reflect seasonality in the building sector, and our most important trading periods in terms of
revenue, operating results and cash flow has historically been in our first and fourth financial quarters as a result of
increased new build and RMI activity during warmer periods with longer daylight hours, among other things. In the
winter months, we typically generate less revenue due to low construction and renovation activity as a result of cold
weather, partially offset by an increase in indoor activities such as painting. Additionally, our results of operations are
affected by generally consistent seasonal swings in our net working capital. Typically, we experience a cash outflow in
the winter months as we tend to incur additional expenses in advance of our peak sales periods that occur during our first
and fourth financial quarters. We typically experience a cash inflow in the summer and fall as we finalize collecting
payments from customers who have made purchases for their spring construction and renovation projects simultaneously
as we begin collecting payments from customers who are making purchases for their summer and early fall construction
and renovation projects.

We finance our working capital needs through cash and cash equivalents and third-party borrowings. Following
the completion of the Transactions, we will utilize cash on hand and our Revolving Credit Facility to cover swings in our
working capital. See also “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Net Working Capital.”

Our results are also affected by periods of abnormal, severe or unseasonable weather conditions, particularly if
such events occur during our peak sales period. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—
_Our business is seasonal and could also be adversely affected by sustained periods of unfavorable weather.”_

**_Cost Saving and Other Strategic Initiatives_**

_Felix Strategy_

In the year ended July 31, 2013, our former management initiated our “Felix” strategy, focusing on the
simultaneous pursuit of strong topline growth and cost cutting while also seeking to strengthen the Group’s central
management. In connection with our “Felix” strategy, our business experienced, among other things, an increase in
headquarters and other central costs without capturing related scale benefits and a drop in gross margins as a result of
our former management’s focus on high volume products with lower margins. Additionally, during the implementation
of our “Felix” strategy, our business lacked strategic focus seeking to tailor our product and service offering to both
private customers and B2B customers which led to a loss of scale benefits in our product offerings to our core SME
customers. Furthermore, due to inconsistent category management across the Group, our customers experienced
inconsistent products assortment, availability and product pricing. Due to inconsistent leadership and management
difficulties across our business units we also lost key personnel during the implementation of our “Felix” strategy.
Ultimately, our “Felix” strategy did not have a positive impact on our financial position during its implementation.

_Back to Basics_

In the year ended July 31, 2017, after our CEO, Søren P. Olesen, stepped into the role of Group-wide CEO from
his previous position with STARK DK, we initiated our “Back to Basics” strategy with the intention to drive our top-line
growth by refocusing our operations on our SME core customer group and enhance our profitability by streamlining our
headquarters and central administration functions, rationalizing our footprint, simplifying our distribution network and
driving better sourcing initiatives through leveraging our scale and harmonizing our product assortment across the
Nordics. We estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate cost savings of approximately €7 million in
the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, mainly as a result of better contractual terms following our renegotiation of
key supply contracts and as a result of headcount reductions and a more streamlined headquarters if these cost saving
measures had been implemented on November 1, 2016.

Overall, we have identified approximately €74 million in operational, sourcing- and network-related cost savings
for the Ongoing Business, which we aim to realize by 2021. Additionally, we have initiated several topline growth
initiatives, primarily related to product assortment, availability and pricing, which management believes, together with
improvements in the market, have resulted in an increase in revenue for the Ongoing Business of approximately 5%
during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017.

Better Sourcing

To reach our objective of developing better sourcing processes, we are implementing a systematic review of our
supply chain operations by focusing on three key components: (i) our own brand products, (ii) our direct sourcing costs
and (iii) our indirect sourcing costs. By increasing our focus on own brand products, we intend to continue supporting
our margins by developing our own brand product portfolio to have reduced overlap with our branded products portfolio
and building a strategic common core range of 800 own brand SKUs shared across our business units. We expect that
increased sourcing for our own brand products will provide us with greater leverage in negotiations with our suppliers
than we may have with suppliers of branded products since suppliers of branded products also receive offers from our
competitors. In addition, we are in the process of decreasing our direct sourcing costs by developing our pan-Nordic
sourcing setup and consolidating volumes to achieve economies of scale by centralizing sourcing functions through
STARK Group Sourcing, our Group sourcing unit, and decreasing procurement costs. We have recently implemented a
new organizational model with a new sourcing management team and board and we intend to further leverage our
harmonized sourcing platform across the Nordics to consolidate our supplier base and maximize purchasing power.
Moreover, we are in the process of reviewing and negotiating our sourcing contracts across our business to align
purchasing terms and procurement prices across our four business units. Furthermore, we intend to maintain and, in
certain cases, strengthen our general policy of direct sourcing, which allows us to directly negotiate prices with
suppliers. In parallel, we are in the process of decreasing our indirect sourcing costs by continuing to streamline our
supplier base, creating performance-based supplier contracts and improving the management of demand for our products
and supplies. We estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate sourcing- and procurement-related cost
savings of approximately €3 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, mainly as a result of better
contractual terms following our renegotiation of key supply contracts, a leaner cost base for our supply chain and
enhanced optimization opportunities for our network if these cost saving measures had been implemented on November
1, 2016.

Overall, we have identified approximately €51 million of sourcing and procurement-related cost savings for the
Ongoing Business, primarily including direct sourcing initiatives and increased own brand sourcing, which we aim to
realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.

Stronger Network

In connection with building a stronger network to better serve our customers, we are optimizing our branch
footprint and logistics platform and providing greater access to increased availability of stock. For example, we exited
our Silvan DIY business in 2017 to increase focus on our SME segment, and developed and launched a new SME
marketing campaign to leverage our fastest growing profit pool. Additionally, to optimize our physical footprint, in
2017, we closed 30 underperforming branches in low growth areas to focus our business on regions that are expected to
outperform national averages. We will continue optimizing the footprint of our branches to capture the benefit of
expected growth in the markets in coming years and increase our competitive advantages. While we believe our business
benefits from our current geographic coverage, we may in the future pursue strategic relocations and consolidations of
certain branches to better locations along highly travelled roads benefiting from higher footfall or visibility and will
assess any new branches that we bring into our network on a case-by-case basis. We continue to monitor our existing
branch base to selectively close or merge branches that are performing poorly or otherwise do not meet our expectations.

-----

Additionally, we aim to further simplify our distribution network while optimizing our delivery routes and pricing terms
by, among other things, establishing additional ship hubs, developing our recently established light-side hub in Denmark
to streamline the distribution of slow moving items, downsizing and outsourcing certain of our centralized warehouse
processes to achieve cost savings and consolidating the number of dedicated branches used for the distribution of
products to better allocate our resources.

Overall, we have identified approximately €13 million of network-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business,
primarily related to a simplified distribution network and an optimized footprint of branches, which we aim to realize by
the year ending July 31, 2021.

Efficient Operator

We intend to continue focusing on cost management through reduced overhead costs and the optimization of
operations at the business unit and branch level. We have recently implemented a number of initiatives to reorganize our
managerial structure and optimize the size of our headquarters, with the aim of strengthening local decision-making and
accountability and regaining focus on day-to-day operations at the business unit and branch level. At the same time, we
intend to maintain efficiency through centralized functions from our headquarters, including for strategy, performance,
human resources and compliance across our business. For example, in 2016, we initiated significant downsizing at our
headquarters, including the relocation of 178 FTEs from our central headquarters to the business unit level to clarify
responsibilities, heighten responsiveness to support requirements and increase accountability. We also initiated a total
planned reduction of 55 FTEs, excluding the hiring of 19 FTEs, expected to be completed by the end of June 2018. We
estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate operational cost savings of approximately €4 million in
the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, mainly as a result of headcount reductions and a more streamlined
headquarters if these cost saving measures had been implemented on November 1, 2016.

Overall, we have identified approximately €11 million of operational cost savings for the Ongoing Business,
primarily related to a leaner headquarters, a streamlined workforce and increased focus on business unit-level activity
and cost management, which we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.

Top Line Growth Initiatives

To improve our revenue generation and sales volume, we have refocused our business on our core customer
group, SMEs, which represent the fastest growing profit pool in the Nordic construction materials distribution market. In
line with strategically refocusing our business, we are intend to offer SMEs an industry-leading product assortment and
availability which is tailored to our customers’ trade-specific needs. Additionally, we have recently begun implementing
a smart pricing strategy across our business which is aimed at rationalizing shelf prices. In line with our smart pricing
strategy, we have established pricing structures under which we offer discounts on certain trade-specific “high runner”
products, competitive prices for items purchased frequently and fairer prices for items purchased infrequently.
Furthermore, we intend to capture digital growth opportunities by leveraging our existing physical network of branches
and logistics facilities, as well as industry experience and product expertise and improving our online platform for SMEs
to quickly, efficiently and comprehensively serve and advise our customers on the best products for each of their
projects’ needs.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

**_The Acquisition_**

In the future, we will report consolidated financial statements and other information for the Issuer and its
consolidated subsidiaries prepared under IFRS. The fiscal year of the Issuer ends on July 31 of each calendar year and
the first annual consolidated financial statements for the Issuer will be available in respect of the fiscal year ending
July 31, 2018. The Issuer will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS, which
will affect the comparability of the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements with the Financial Statements contained in
this offering memorandum. We will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Transactions to our
financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Completion Date. The application of purchase
accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance sheet, which
may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and
depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our financial statements could be materially
different once the adjustments are made.

Furthermore, we will incur a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the Transactions. As of
October 31, 2017, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had total third-party debt in the aggregate
amount of €515 million, consisting of the Notes. In addition, we would have had €100 million available for drawing

75


-----

under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information, Unaudited Adjusted
_Financial Information for the Ongoing Business and Other Financial Data.” Our indebtedness may limit our flexibility_
in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business opportunities, since a substantial portion our
cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness, and this may place us at a competitive
disadvantage as some of our competitors are less leveraged.

**_Disposal of Silvan and the Effects of the Branch Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment_**

On July 10, 2017, in connection with our strategy to refocus our ongoing business operations primarily on B2B
customers, we announced our agreement to divest our DIY brand, Silvan, to Aurelius Group. The sale of Silvan
concluded on August 31, 2017. Additionally, we divested our Cheapy chain, a Swedish discount chain, which was sold
in April 2014, and Oscar Perschard, a small Norwegian branch, which was sold in July 2014. We include the results of
operation, financial position and cash flows from Silvan, Cheapy and Oscar Perschard in our Financial Statements as
discontinued operations, which are shown separately from continuing operations in our Financial Statements. In this
offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, references to any financial data are only to financial data from
continuing operations and exclude the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Silvan, Cheapy and
Oscar Perschard.

Additionally, in line with our strategy to focus our business on areas with above market growth, we closed 30
underperforming branches in low growth areas, including 14 STARK DK branches in January 2017, eight STARK FI
branches in January 2017, seven Beijer branches in April 2017 and the Norwegian Sandvold business in March 2017. As
these branch closures occurred during our financial year ended July 31, 2017, our Audited Financial Statements include
the contribution to our financial results by these 30 branches until their respective dates of closure. Additionally, the
comparative unaudited financial data for the three months ended October 31, 2016 included in the Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements includes the contribution to our financial results by these 30 branches for the entire three month
reporting period. In the future, these 30 branches will not contribute to the consolidated financial results of the Issuer as
a result of which the future consolidated financial statements of the Issuer will not be comparable to our Audited
Financial Statements and the comparative unaudited financial data for the three months ended October 31, 2016 included
in the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. At the same time, our future revenue will be affected by our ability to
retain sales from these closed branches, which would create an initial increase in year-on-year revenue during the first
twelve months following the branch closures as sales would be concentrated to fewer branches. We expect this increase
in revenue to weaken in subsequent periods once the retained revenue has been fully reflected in our financial
statements. Furthermore, following the completion of the Acquisition, the Issuer will report its consolidated financial
results excluding certain operational properties in Denmark and Norway, a distribution center in Finland, the
headquarters in Copenhagen and 30 vacant properties, which have historically been included in the Target’s financial
results but do not form part of the Target’s business that will be acquired by Lone Star Fund X in connection with the
Acquisition. As a result, the future consolidated financial statements of the Issuer will not be comparable to our
Financial Statements.

We also include in this offering memorandum certain Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing
Business for revenue, cost of sales, gross profit, operating costs, trading profit and Adjusted EBITDA. The Unaudited
Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business has been derived by adjusting the historical revenue, gross
profit, trading profit and Adjusted EBITDA to give effect to the Branch Closure and Property Portfolio Adjustment
described above as of and for the periods presented therein. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data” and
“Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business.” The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information
for the Ongoing Business is presented for information purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of
our results of operations that we would have reported had the Branch Closure and Property Portfolio Adjustment been
completed as of the dates and for the periods presented therein, and should not be taken as representative of our
consolidated results of operations or financial condition following the completion of the Transactions. The Unaudited
Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is not comparable to the historical financial results of the
Target presented or included in this offering memorandum, and will not be comparable to the future consolidated
financial statements of the Issuer.

**Description of Key Income Statement Line Items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue comprises the sales value of the goods sold and services rendered. Revenue is recorded net of returns,
discounts/offers and value added taxes.

76


-----

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit is the difference between our revenue and cost of sales where cost of sales includes the purchase
price of the products sold and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the location in a condition ready for sale.
These costs include those of purchasing, storing, salaries and transporting products to the extent that it relates to bringing
the inventories to the location in a condition ready for sale.

**_Operating Costs_**

Operating costs comprises amortization of acquired intangible assets and other operating costs. Other operating
costs include:

     - employee costs, comprising, among others, wages, salaries, social security and pension expenses and other
employee benefits;

     - infrastructure costs, comprising, among others, external rental costs related to properties rented from third
parties, equipment rental costs such as fork lifts, waste disposal costs, rates and property taxes net of
external rent income from rent charged to third parties for areas occupied on our premises;

     - fleet costs, comprising, among others, costs related to our own and rented fleets, costs related to freight
services provided by third parties and labor costs for truck drivers;

     - marketing and advertising costs and income, comprising, among others, advertising and marketing costs,
including for flyers, brochures and catalogues, costs associated with TV commercials and costs related to
customer events;

     - administrative expenses, comprising, among others, the costs of general management, including fees for
professional services and costs associated with alarms and business insurance; and

     - other operating expenses, comprising, among others, other staff costs, such as company cars and fuel, travel
expenses, external training costs, external IT costs and costs related to bad debts and credit insurance.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

We define Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business as historical profit for the period before financial
income, financial expenses, tax for the period, depreciation and amortization, exceptional items related to the Ongoing
Business and the Ferguson Group management fee, excluding the impact on operating profit resulting from the Branch
Closures as described in “Presentation of Financial and Other Data” and “Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information
_for the Ongoing Business” adjusted for certain charges to us by Ferguson for historical Ferguson Group-related functions_
and services, such as finance and treasury support and oversight, which will no longer be indicative of our financial
performance following the Acquisition Completion Date. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Data—
_Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business to historical profit._

**Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business**

The following section discusses our Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business for the
periods set forth below. We believe that presenting the discussion and analysis of our Unaudited Adjusted Financial
Information for the Ongoing Business in this manner promotes the overall usefulness of the comparison given the
complexities involved with comparing periods of differing lengths and the impact of the Branch Closures and the
Property Portfolio Adjustment on our Financial Statements. See also “Presentation of Financial and Other Data” and
“Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business.”

_Revenue for the Ongoing Business_

Revenue for the Ongoing Business increased by €32 million, or 5.5%, to €618 million for the three months ended
October 31, 2017 from €586 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016. This increase was driven by growth
across all of our four business units as a result of strong customer demand as well as the effect from our initiatives to
drive top-line growth. Additionally, we believe that we have gained market share in all of our four operating countries.
For a more detailed discussion of the change in revenue for the Ongoing Business from the three months ended
October 31, 2016 to the three months ended October 31, 2017, please see our analysis of revenue development for the
Ongoing Business by business unit below.

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our STARK DK business unit increased by €7 million, or 2.8%, to
€256 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €249 million for the three months ended October 31,
2016. This increase was primarily driven by a combination of successfully winning several large new customers and an
increase in revenue generated by existing SME customers.

STARK FI

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit increased by €10 million, or 6.8%, to
€157 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €147 million for the three months ended October 31,
2016. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in new construction activity in urban areas and an increase in
sales to local builders following the roll-out of our “Project Hunt” initiative, which involves STARK FI contacting local
builders whose volumes have recently declined.

Beijer

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit increased by €13 million, or 8.7%, to
€162 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €149 million for the three months ended October 31,
2016. This increase was primarily driven by a combination of three factors: regaining lost sales associates that left for
competitors in previous years, hiring more sales associates in a dedicated initiative called “Top Sales” and addressing
product availability issues that arose in connection with the roll-out of a new product assortment.

Neumann

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our Neumann business unit increased by €2 million, or 4.9%, to
€43 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €41 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016.
This increase was primarily driven by increased sales from the recently opened Oslo branch.

_Gross Profit for the Ongoing Business_

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business increased by €9 million, or 6.3%, to €152 million for the three months
ended October 31, 2017 from €143 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016. This increase was primarily
driven by an increase in sales in our higher gross margin business in Sweden and better pricing in Denmark. For a more
detailed discussion of the change in gross profit for the Ongoing Business from the three months ended October 31, 2016
to the three months ended October 31, 2017, please see our analysis of gross profit development for the Ongoing

STARK DK

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our STARK DK business unit decreased by €2 million, or 3.2%, to
€61 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €63 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016.
This decrease was primarily driven by mix effects as a result of a higher share of large customers that tend to generate
lower margins.

STARK FI

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit increased by €2 million, or 8.0%, to
€27 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €25 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016.
This increase was primarily driven by strong construction activity, partially offset by lower gross margin percentage
driven by sales channel mix.

Beijer

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit increased by €4 million, or 9.5%, to
€46 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €42 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016.
This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales, which positively impacted bonuses we received from suppliers,
as well as a reduction in the value of rebates we offered.

Neumann

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Neumann business unit increased by €3 million, or 33.3%, to
€12 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €9 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016.
This increase was primarily due to the implementation of our smart pricing initiative, which allowed us to manually
increase pricing for certain products, as well as increased sales to large customers.

_Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €8 million, or 25.0%, to €40 million for the three months ended October 31,
2017 from €32 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the increase
in gross profit and improved cost management.

_Revenue for the Ongoing Business_

July 31, 2017 from €2,108 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in
revenue in our STARK DK, STARK FI and Neumann business units, partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue in
our Beijer business unit due to one-off impacts that increased revenues in the prior year while the first half of the year
ended July 31, 2017 saw negative revenue growth, revenue growth picked up significantly in the second half of the year
ended July 31, 2017 due to strong construction activity, the implementation of various initiatives and other factors. For a
more detailed discussion of the change in revenue for the Ongoing Business from the year ended July 31, 2016 to the

STARK DK

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our STARK DK business unit increased by €14 million, or 1.6%, to
€892 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €878 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was
primarily driven by increased sales to SMEs following the implementation of our “Back to Basics” strategy to increase
our top-line growth. During the period under review, we supported our strategic focus on SME customers through
initiatives including improved availability of core products, focused product assortment and sales training. The growth in
revenue for our STARK DK business unit was partially offset by a decline in private customers as a result of a general
shift away from DIY activity in Denmark.

STARK FI

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit increased by €34 million, or 6.6%, to
€553 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €519 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was
primarily driven by growth in the Finnish construction market as well as management’s strategic focus on SMEs
supported by a better product assortment and product display. In addition, revenue increased due to the successful
execution of “Project Hunt,” which involved STARK FI contacting local builders whose volumes have recently
declined.

Beijer

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit decreased by €11 million, or 2.0%, to
€554 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €565 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This decrease was
primarily driven by a loss of sales associates that had left Beijer in previous years, which was partially offset by the
addition of 28 experienced sales staff as part of our top-line growth initiatives during the third and fourth quarters of the
year ended July 31, 2017, which led to increased sales growth in the fourth quarter of the year ended July 31, 2017.
Additionally, the decrease in revenue was also driven by a reduction in the ROT tax subsidy from 50% to 30%, which
positively affected the prior year period as customers brought forward certain RMI projects to the prior period to take
advantage of the higher tax deduction.

Neumann

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our Neumann business unit increased by €6 million, or 4.1%, to
€152 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €146 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was
primarily driven by overall market growth in Norway and strong performance of our Tromsø, Bergen and Mjåvann
branches, as well as large customer projects commencing in the year.

_Gross Profit for the Ongoing Business_

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business increased by €3 million, or 0.6%, to €532 million for the year ended
July 31, 2017 from €529 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by increases in
revenue generated by our STARK FI and STARK DK business units, offset by a reduction in revenue generated by our
Beijer business unit. For a more detailed discussion of the change in gross profit for the Ongoing Business from the year
ended July 31, 2016 to the year ended July 31, 2017, please see our analysis of gross profit development for the Ongoing

STARK DK

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our STARK DK business unit increased by €3 million, or 1.3%, to
€227 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €224 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was
primarily driven by better pricing as a result of the implementation of our smart pricing strategy, which increased
underlying margins and profit.

STARK FI

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit increased by €6 million, or 6.7%, to
€96 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €90 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was
primarily due to a number of corrective actions relating to the reversal and replacement of one of our price reduction
initiatives as well as the implementation of a formal weekly price review to monitor manual pricing levels at the branch
level. Such actions led to a 0.4% increase in gross margin for our STARK FI business unit for the fourth quarter in the
year ended July 31, 2017 compared to the first quarter in the year ended July 31, 2017.

Beijer

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit decreased by €6 million, or 3.6%, to
€159 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €165 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This decrease was
primarily due to a shift in mix of sales to local and regional builders from sales through our stock collected and stock
delivered channels to sales through our direct delivery channel, combined with pricing pressure from competitors. In
response, we have implemented a number of strategic initiatives which target margin growth, including reviewing all
product pricing for our Beijer business unit, optimizing our supply chain and ensuring that delivery charges are passed
on to customers more consistently.

Neumann

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Neumann business unit increased by €1 million, or 2.6%, to
€40 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €39 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter of the year ended July 31, 2017 compared to the fourth
quarter in the year ended July 31, 2016, which was primarily due to the implementation of a new pricing strategy to
increase price points, increased focus on monitoring margins and an increased commitment to pass through price
increases from suppliers to customers more consistently. This increase was partially offset by a slowdown in the oil
industry, which resulted in pricing pressure in our branches located along the southwest coast of Norway.

_Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business_

Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business decreased by €1 million, or 1.1%, to €93 million for the year ended
July 31, 2017 from €94 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by higher operating
expenses, particularly relating to an increase in sales personnel and one-off employee costs.

July 31, 2016 from €2,100 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by revenue
increases in our STARK DK and Beijer business units partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our STARK FI and
Neumann business units. For a more detailed discussion of the change in revenue for the Ongoing Business from the

STARK DK

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our STARK DK business unit increased by €22 million, or 2.6%, to
€878 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €856 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This increase was
primarily driven by higher sales volumes as a result of increased activity in the professional construction and renovation
industry in Denmark, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from private consumers.

STARK FI

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit decreased by €14 million, or 2.6%, to
€519 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €533 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This decrease was
primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from private consumers as well as a decrease in revenue from retailer
customers following the weaker trading performance of certain smaller retailer customers.

Beijer

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit increased by €18 million, or 3.3%, to
€565 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €547 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This increase was
primarily driven by a reduction in the ROT tax subsidy from 50% to 30%, which increased construction and renovation
activity during the first half of our financial year ended July 31, 2016 as customers and consumers brought forward
certain RMI projects before the tax reduction took effect from January 1, 2016.

Neumann

Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our Neumann business unit decreased by €18 million, or 11.0%, to
€146 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €164 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This decrease was
primarily driven by a decrease in demand from customers in the oil industry during the year ended July 31, 2016, which
primarily affected Neumann’s two largest branches, Byrne and Stavanger. This decrease in revenue was partially offset
by increased revenue at our Kristiansand branch driven by growth in the local market as well as increased project
activity with a number of large customers.

_Gross Profit for the Ongoing Business_

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business decreased by €5 million, or 0.9%, to €529 million for the year ended
July 31, 2016 from €534 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by reductions in
our STARK DK and STARK FI businesses. For a more detailed discussion of the change in gross profit for the Ongoing
Business from the year ended July 31, 2015 to the year ended July 31, 2016, please see our analysis of gross profit

STARK FI

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit decreased by €3 million, or 3.2%, to
€90 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €93 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This decrease was
primarily due to higher direct sales as well as the adverse impact of pricing initiatives that were implemented by our
former management team in order to drive revenue growth.

Beijer

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit increased by €1 million, or 0.6%, to
€165 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €164 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This increase was
primarily due to growth in the RMI market, as customers sought to take advantage of the ROT tax subsidy, partially
offset by an increase in the discounts offered to customers.

Neumann

Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Neumann business unit decreased by €5 million, or 11.4%, to
€39 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €44 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This decrease was
primarily due to a general decrease in customer demand in Norway as well as a decrease in revenue generation by our
Byrne and Stavanger branches, in particular.

_Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business_

Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business decreased by €9 million, or 8.7%, to €94 million for the year ended
July 31, 2016 from €103 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower gross
profit and an increase in employee costs.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Historically, our primary source of liquidity has been our cash flows from operations as well lines of credit made
available to Ferguson. Our primary cash needs relate to capital and other expenditures for funding our working capital
requirements, maintaining and refurbishing existing branches and meeting debt service requirements. Our ability to
generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic,
financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in
“—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors.” Following the completion of the Transactions, we
will also have access to €100.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working capital
and general corporate needs. The availability of this facility is dependent upon certain conditions described further under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”

We believe that, based on our current cash flows, these sources of liquidity, together with available borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditure and debt service for at
least the next twelve months. We cannot, however, assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from
operating activities, that the currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized, or that
future borrowings will be available under the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service
our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements
_and the Notes—We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we_

_Cash Flows from Operating Activities from Continuing Operations for the Historical Business_

Our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business is primarily driven
by movements in our operating results before amortization, depreciation and impairment, our net working capital, and
interest and tax expenses.

Our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the three
months ended October 31, 2017, amounted to an outflow of €33 million, primarily driven by an outflow of cash due to
the cash tied up in increasing working capital, specifically an increase in trade and other receivables, partially offset by
positive operating profit.

Our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the three
months ended October 31, 2016, amounted to an outflow of €24 million, primarily driven by a positive operating profit,
offset by unfavorable movements in working capital.

Our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended
July 31, 2017, amounted to an inflow of €52 million, primarily driven by a reduction in net working capital, driven by a
decrease in inventories and trade and other receivables and a decrease in provisions and other liabilities.

Our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended
July 31, 2016, amounted to an inflow of €70 million, primarily driven by a positive operating profit, partially offset by
increased inventory levels in STARK DK due to a change in wood supplier and to increased product availability in
STARK FI.

Our cash flow from operating activities for the Historical Business for the year ended July 31, 2015, amounted to
an inflow of €107 million, primarily driven by a positive operating profit, a reduction in net working capital supported
by longer payment terms with suppliers in Finland instead of cash discounts and a focus across all business units on
inventory reduction.

_Cash Flows from Investing Activities from Continuing Operations for the Historical Business_

Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business principally relates to
capital expenditures, including in relation to the purchases of land, property, plant and equipment, the refurbishment and
maintenance of our existing branches, range review related changes and the investment in our distribution center and IT
as well as intangible assets.

Cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the three months
ended October 31, 2017, decreased by €11 million from a cash outflow of €11 million for the three months ended
October 31, 2016, to a cash outflow of €22 million, primarily driven by costs related to the new distribution center for
STARK DK and the new STARK Group head office as well as investments in certain of our Beijer branches.

Cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended
July 31, 2017, increased by €19 million from a cash outflow of €34 million for the year ended July 31, 2016, to a cash
outflow of €53 million for the year ended July 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of the
freehold of an existing branch for €5 million and land for a new distribution center in Denmark for €11 million, in
addition to an IT project costing €3 million, during the year ended July 31, 2017.

Cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended
July 31, 2016, decreased by €8 million from a cash outflow of €42 million for the year ended July 31, 2015, to a cash
outflow of €34 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a planned reduction in
investment in branch maintenance, offset by the acquisition of the freehold of an existing branch in Finland for
€8 million in the year ended July 31, 2015.

_Cash Flows from Financing Activities from Continuing Operations for the Historical Business_

Cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the three months
ended October 31, 2017, decreased by €62 million from a cash outflow of €14 million for the three months ended
October 31, 2016, to a cash outflow of €76 million, primarily driven by the repayment of our secured long-term bank
loans in full on September 30, 2017.

85


-----

Cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended
July 31, 2017, decreased by €91 million from a cash inflow of €36 million for the year ended July 31, 2016, to a cash
outflow of €55 million for the year ended July 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by the partial repayment of
our secured long-term bank loans.

Cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended
July 31, 2016, increased by €107 million from a cash outflow of €71 million for the year ended July 31, 2015, to a cash
inflow of €36 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by a drawdown from the
Ferguson Group cash pooling facility.

**_Net Working Capital_**

Our working capital generally mirrors developments in our operating business and certain seasonal patterns may
therefore cause material fluctuations in our net working capital.

Historically, our inventory levels have increased ahead of our peak sales periods during our first and fourth
financial quarters. See “—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.”
Typically, we experience a cash outflow in the winter months as we tend to incur additional expenses in advance of our
peak sales periods that occur during our first and fourth financial quarters. We typically experience a cash inflow in the
summer and fall as we finalize collecting payments from customers who have made purchases for their spring
construction and renovation projects simultaneously as we begin collecting payments from customers who are making
purchases for their summer and early fall construction and renovation projects. Despite the seasonal variations in net
working capital, our net working capital is, on average, positive. During the year ended July 31, 2017, our working
capital for the Historical Business normalized from its high point of approximately €80 million in February to its average
level of approximately €20 million until May.

Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to utilize cash on hand and borrowings available under
the Revolving Credit Facility to manage seasonal variations in our net working capital. See also “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

We define adjusted net working capital as inventories plus trade and other receivables less trade and other
payables. Adjusted net working capital does not include provisions, related party balances, current tax receivables and
payables and retirement benefit obligations. The following information is a summary of the adjusted net working capital
related to continuing operations of the Target for the Historical Business as of July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and
October 31 2017, respectively:

Adjusted net working capital for the Historical Business as of October 31, 2017, increased by €66 million from
adjusted net working capital of €(67) million as of July 31, 2017, to adjusted net working capital of €(1) million,
primarily driven by seasonality given that our working capital typically increases due to an increase in trade and other
receivables during the first quarter of our financial year from customers who have made purchases for their summer and
early fall construction projects.

Adjusted net working capital for the Historical Business as of July 31, 2017, decreased by €17 million from
adjusted net working capital of €(50) million as of July 31, 2016, to adjusted net working capital of €(67) million,
primarily driven by a decrease in inventory, trade and other receivables and payables primarily due to branch closures in
that year.

Adjusted net working capital for the Historical Business as of July 31, 2016, increased by €7 million from
adjusted net working capital of €(57) million as of July 31, 2015, to adjusted net working capital of €(50) million,
primarily driven by an increase in inventory across some of our business units, driven by our former management’s
desire to increase topline, partially offset by a reduction of trade and other receivables as well as an increase in payables.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of October 31, 2017, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements.

**Employee Pensions**

We operate defined benefit pension plans in Sweden and Norway and defined contribution pension plans in
Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway. As of July 31, 2017, our defined benefit pension plans in Norway and Sweden had
accrued liabilities of €48 million and €1 million, respectively. In line with Swedish law requirements, Beijer has taken out a
credit insurance policy with PRI Pensionsgaranti. Beijer’s obligations to PRI Pensionsgaranti under the credit insurance
policy are guaranteed by Ferguson and secured by a floating charge and pledge over certain of Beijer’s assets and business.
Ferguson’s guarantee will remain in place until the credit insurance policy is due for renewal in May 2018. In connection
with the Transactions, we have contacted PRI Pensionsgaranti and informed them of the anticipated change in ownership of
Stark Group. Following the consummation of the Transactions, PRI Pensionsgaranti may require additional or replacement
guarantees from one or more members of the Group, including the Issuer or one or more Guarantors, and/or may require
additional collateral, including over assets and properties constituting Post-Issue Date Collateral. See also “—Risks Related
_to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes— Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, any credit facility that_
_refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and_
_obligations permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the_
_Notes. Holders of the Notes will not control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances,” “Description of_

(2) The Revolving Credit Facility matures six months prior to the maturity of the Notes and because such facility consists of revolving
indebtedness, which may be drawn and repaid from time to time, such indebtedness is not included in this table. Based on our current estimate
of our cash flow and operations, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to meet our seasonal
working capital requirements. See also “—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.” The
Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid and redrawn from time to time to fund our working capital needs. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

**Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and
liquidity risks associated with our underlying assets, liabilities, forecast transactions and firm commitments. Our treasury
department is responsible for managing our exposure to market risk that arises in connection with operations and
financial activities, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and liquidity, and credit risk
management.

The following sections discuss our significant exposures to market risk. The following discussions do not address
other risks that we face in the normal course of business, including country risk and legal risk.

**_Interest Rate Risk Management_**

We manage our net exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate financial debt and variable
rate financial debt in our total financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, the Issuer or its subsidiaries may in the
future enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which we have exchanged periodic payments based on a notional
amount and agreed upon fixed and variable interest rates, and forward contracts, in which we exchange fixed amounts of
foreign currency and fixed amounts of euro.

87


-----

Upon completion of the Transactions, we will be exposed to market risks as a result of changes in interest rates,
particularly in relation to floating rate indebtedness, including the Floating Rate Notes and borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility. Financial liabilities issued at floating rates will expose us to cash flow interest rate risk, while
financial liabilities issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk. To manage the exposure to changes in
interest rates, following the completion of the Transactions, we may use interest rate swaps to exchange all or a portion
of the interest rate exposure on the Floating Rate Notes from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate.

**_Currency Risks_**

We are exposed to foreign exchange risk, primarily with respect to the euro and, to a lesser extent, Swedish
krona. Our principal foreign currency exposures arise from our financing being principally in euro after the Transactions,
while our profits are generated in the local currencies of our respective business units. Our operations in Finland involve
the euro while our operations in Denmark involve the Danish krone, which fluctuates in value alongside the euro, and
together, these operations generated 61%, 59% and 59% of our gross profit for the Ongoing Business in the year ended
July 31, 2017, July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, respectively. Our residual exposure is primarily related to the Swedish
krona, which was relatively stable against the euro in recent years but which we monitor closely to reduce our currency
risk and increase any required hedging.

Our key operating currencies are the euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone. Our revenue and
costs, including sourcing costs, for each business unit are primarily in the respective local currency, which offers natural
hedging opportunities. We also have limited exposure to foreign exchange risks related to U.S. dollars, as we source
some of our own brand products from China in U.S. dollars. In the year ended July 31, 2017, we estimate our sourcing
spend amounted to less than $10 million for own brand products sourced from China, totaling up to 0.5% of our revenue
for the Ongoing Business. In addition, we sometimes source certain of our products for our Beijer branches from
Denmark, exposing us to limited foreign exchange risks between the Danish krone and Swedish krona.

We may use forward contracts to manage our foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions
and recognized financial liabilities.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk arises mostly in connection with cash flows generated and used in financing activities, and
particularly by servicing debt, in terms of both interest and capital, and from all our payment obligations that result from
business activities. Our liquidity management policy involves minimizing the available cash on a daily basis. The
reimbursement capacity is reviewed annually. An adjustment during the year would be possible if necessary.

In general, we manage our liquidity risk by monitoring our cash flow and rolling liquidity reserve forecast in
order to ensure that we have sufficient committed facilities to meet our liquidity needs.

**Critical Accounting Judgments**

The preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The Target’s critical accounting estimates and judgements are described in note 1 to the Audited Financial
Statements included herein.

**Accounting Developments and Changes**

The following standards have been published, but not yet applied:

a) IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”

b) IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”

88


-----

c) IFRS 16 “Leasing”

d) IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”

The Directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 17 in future periods will have no
material impact on the financial statements of the Group, but are still assessing the impact.

IFRS 16 will impact the majority of the Group’s operating lease arrangement as each lease will give rise to a
right of use asset, which will be depreciated on a straight-line basis, and a lease liability, with the related interest charge.
This will replace existing lease balances on the balance sheet and charges to the income statement.

The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however the impact will depend on the transition
approach and the contracts in effect at the time of adoption. It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable
estimate of the financial impact on the Group’s consolidated financial results.

**Market Overview**

**_Nordic Construction and Renovation Market_**

The building materials supplied by STARK Group serve the Nordic construction and renovation market. The
construction and renovation market may be divided into two sub-sectors with different market dynamics: (i) new
construction (“new build”), involving the construction of new residential and non-residential buildings, and
(ii) renovation, maintenance and improvement (“RMI”), involving construction work performed on existing residential
and non-residential buildings. Within the construction and renovation market, the residential and non-residential sectors
are the key driving elements.

According to a leading management consulting firm, the total Nordic residential and non-residential construction
and renovation market was estimated at €105 billion in 2016, with the majority, or €58 billion, comprising the resilient
RMI market and the remainder, or €47 billion, comprising the new build market.

_RMI Market_

The RMI market is resilient and significantly less affected by market fluctuations than the new build market. The
Nordic RMI market exhibited historically stable and resilient growth even through the economic downturn after the 2008
financial crisis, experiencing positive year-on-year growth in 14 out of the last 17 years according to Euroconstruct.

STARK Group has significant exposure to this resilient market, with RMI activity accounting for approximately
60% of revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business in the twelve
months ended October 31, 2017, according to management estimates. Such exposure to the RMI market leads to a
degree of counter-cyclicality of gross profit in downturn periods. New build sales tend to be characterized by larger
orders for construction projects that can involve products, as well as a sales channel, that generate lower margins. In
contrast, RMI sales, which are made predominantly to SME customers that comprise STARK Group’s core customer
group, tend to be characterized by more frequent and smaller purchases of high margin products, typically through a
sales channel that generates higher margins. In a period of potential downturn, the resilience of the RMI market counteracts the cyclicality of the new build market, and while new build sales may decrease, gross margins may benefit from a
higher share of revenue coming from higher-margin RMI sales.

Growth in the RMI market is impacted by a number of macroeconomic, regulatory, and sector-specific factors,
such as interest rates, government subsidies or housing transaction volumes. According to Euroconstruct, the Nordic
RMI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2016 and 2019. In particular, the Danish,
Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian RMI markets are forecasted to grow at CAGRs of approximately 2.1%, 0.9%, 1.7%
and 2.2%, respectively, over the same period.

Residential RMI

The Nordic residential RMI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2016 and
2019, driven by an increasing willingness and ability to pay for repairs and modernizations, in line with historical growth
rates and favored by the general upturn in the economy.

90


-----

The Danish residential RMI market is forecasted to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 2.2%
between 2016 and 2019, according to Euroconstruct. The Danish residential RMI market is expected to benefit from
higher housing needs due to increasing immigration and a growing trend towards urbanization, and will be further
supported by a tax relief scheme introduced in 2016 that will apply to projects related to energy conservation and the
installation of broadband internet.

The Swedish residential RMI market is expected grow at a CAGR of approximately 0.2% over the period from
2016 to 2019, according to Euroconstruct. Residential RMI experienced stable growth in Sweden between 2014 and
2016 on the back of strong consumer-driven market growth, sustained private consumption, growing house prices and
low interest rates. In addition, simpler rules for the extension of family houses, such as adaptations of roofs to extend
attics, positively impacted the Swedish residential RMI market. Beginning in 2015, the downward adjustment of tax
deductions on labor costs became the key reason behind only moderate growth forecasts over the next two years,
although such effect is expected to be counterbalanced by (i) increasing immigration rates, leading to transformations
and renovations of existing buildings, and (ii) a government support program applying to multi-family properties built
between 1961 and 1975 under which investment support is provided if such building becomes at least 20% more energyefficient after the renovation. Additionally, residential RMI growth in Sweden is expected to reflect the positive impact
of renovation works carried out by property owners in an effort to improve building quality and raise rents.

The Finnish residential RMI market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2016 and
2019. Changes in overall economic conditions in Finland have caused fluctuations in new housing construction volumes,
while RMI has increased steadily over the past 20 years. The outlook of residential RMI in Finland remains positive as
renovation needs are generally growing, with blocks of flats and attached houses reaching the age when renovation is
typically required.

The Norwegian residential RMI market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 2.6%
over the period from 2016 to 2019, primarily driven by strong growth in private consumption, with a substantial increase
in the willingness of households to spend money on RMI works, and by an increasing number of housing
transformations, particularly from office buildings into dwellings. In addition, the Norwegian residential RMI market
will further benefit from an expected increase in real wages and reduction in the level of unemployment.

Across all four countries, housing transaction volumes represent a key driver of RMI activity. When properties
change hands, RMI work is likely to be performed either before the sale by the seller to increase valuation or after the
sale by the buyer to renovate and personalize the newly purchased property. In the twelve months ended September 30,
2017, the total estimated number of sales of residential housing in Denmark reached 57,931 units, slightly above the
long-term average from 2000 to 2016, according to Statistics Denmark. In Sweden, transaction volumes with respect to
granted registrations of real estate titles are in line with the longer term average between 2000 and 2016, according to
SCB.

Non-Residential RMI

Euroconstruct estimates that the Nordic non-residential RMI market will grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7%
between 2016 and 2019, in line with historical growth rates and driven mainly by renovations and modernizations in
public service-type institutions, such as schools or hospitals.

91


-----

The Danish non-residential RMI market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.0% between 2016
and 2019, according to Euroconstruct. RMI needs in public buildings remain high in Denmark. Schools modernization
projects in Denmark are expected to add to overall RMI activity from 2017 onwards. With respect to Danish hospitals, a
number of old units are gradually being replaced by new ones, and the medium-term effect on RMI activity will depend
upon the new usage, if any, of the former hospital buildings.

The Swedish non-residential RMI market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 1.7%
over the period from 2016 to 2019, according to Euroconstruct, primarily driven by a favorable real estate age structure,
which leads to an increased number of buildings in need of repairs or modernizations each year. Furthermore, as long as
rents and vacancies are stable, professional property owners tend to stick to their renovation plans in order to preserve
property value. The government’s goal to reduce energy consumption in the building stock is also expected to boost
non-residential RMI activity.

The Finnish non-residential RMI market is forecasted by Euroconstruct to grow at a CAGR of approximately
1.6% between 2016 and 2019, on the back of considerable expected growth in renovations and modernizations of public
buildings, namely schools and hospitals, as well as in maintenance works on commercial and industrial premises. In
general, due to the age structure, the need to renovate non-residential spaces is expected to increase steadily in the
medium- to long-term.

The non-residential RMI market in Norway is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.8%, according
to Euroconstruct. Key growth drivers include expected growth in building renovations by private companies, on the back
of improved overall economic conditions in Norway, and the extraordinary government grants to municipalities and
counties for RMI works on public buildings offered in 2016 to be utilized in the coming years.

_New Build Market_

For STARK Group, new build activity accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue for the Ongoing
Business and approximately 25% of the gross profit for the Ongoing Business in the twelve months ended October 31,
2017, according to management estimates. New build activity is primarily dependent on factors such as population
growth, immigration rates and urbanization as well as vacancy levels and lease rates within the non-residential new build
market. Growth in new construction reflects general developments in the overall economy, and is impacted by
macroeconomic and regulatory changes such as interest rate movements and government construction targets.

According to Euroconstruct, the Nordic new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately
4.1% over the period from 2016 to 2019. In particular, the Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian new build markets
are forecasted to grow at CAGRs of approximately 6.3%, 7.1%, 0.7% and 2.6%, respectively, over the same period.

Residential New Build

The Nordic residential new build market is forecasted to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 4.2%
between 2016 and 2019, according to Euroconstruct, driven by favorable economic conditions across the Nordics,
increasing immigration and a growing trend towards urbanization.

The Danish residential new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9.6% between 2016
and 2019, driven by immigration as well as internal migration towards larger cities where housing is getting scarcer and
more expensive. In particular, people are expected to move to areas within reasonable distance from Copenhagen, where
the number of unoccupied dwellings is limited and new construction is needed. Furthermore, according to Euroconstruct,
the Danish residential new build market is still considerably below the peak level reached in 2008, which further justifies
strong growth expectations. In addition, with the revision of the residential real estate taxation system in May 2017,
there will be a new system for evaluating the taxable value of each piece of real estate that is expected to result in overall
lower property taxes.

The Swedish residential new build market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 5.9%
over the period from 2016 to 2019, according to Euroconstruct. Sweden is facing substantial immigration, which will
increase dwellings on temporary building permits. According to Euroconstruct, there is still a scarcity of housing in
more than 80% of all Swedish municipalities and approximately 90% of the Swedish population lives in cities
characterized by a housing shortage, especially with respect to affordable rental apartments. For this reason, the Swedish
government has set a construction target of 600,000 new dwellings by 2025, compared to the previous target of 250,000
by 2020. The recent lag in housing supply and population growth is expected to drive long-term new residential demand
in Sweden, as shown in the chart below.

The Finnish residential new build market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.4% between 2016
and 2019, mainly driven by urbanization as well as increased investments in new non-subsidized rental units. Real estate
funds as well as individual citizens are expected to continue to be highly active in acquiring new dwellings given the
scarcity of rental housing in Finland.

The Norwegian residential new build market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between
2016 and 2019, according to Euroconstruct. Euroconstruct forecasts high levels of construction activity and increasing
housing completions in 2018 and 2019. However, capacity constraints, weak population growth and declining house
prices are expected to limit the growth in housing starts over the same period.

Non-Residential New Build

According to Euroconstruct, the Nordic non-residential new build market will grow at a CAGR of approximately
3.9% between 2016 and 2019, fueled by new constructions in both the public and private sectors.

The Danish non-residential new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3.6% over the
period from 2016 to 2019, due to the start of a large program of new hospitals, which is expected to drive growth in the
coming years.

The Swedish non-residential new build market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9.1% between
2016 and 2019, according to Euroconstruct, mainly driven by increased construction in the industrial sector due to
growing industrial production, low vacancy rates in office buildings, particularly in the Stockholm area, and higher
building activity in the commercial sector such as retail chains, on the back of higher demand due to population growth
and higher levels of private consumption.

The Finnish non-residential new build market is expected to remain fairly stable, as the volume of vacant space
remains high across all building types and in nearly all cities, thus exercising some downward pressure on the market.

The Norwegian non-residential new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3.9% in the
period from 2016 to 2019, supported by a brighter economic outlook, a continued weak currency and low interest rates.
Strong growth in new construction in relation to public projects in Norway, primarily new schools and hospitals, will be
counterbalanced by a reduction in population growth and overall low levels of capacity utilization in the industrial sector
where competitiveness is maintained as a result of the weak Norwegian krone. In addition, improved overall economic
conditions in Norway are expected to generate a positive impact on new construction of commercial buildings, such as
shopping centers and stores.

**_Key Market Drivers_**

The Nordic construction materials distribution market is driven by total construction and renovation activity,
which in turn is driven by a variety of factors, including, among others: (i) macroeconomic trends, namely GDP, private
consumption, consumer confidence and interest rates, (ii) regulatory initiatives, such as subsidies and tax deductions on

new construction or renovation works, and (iii) sector-specific trends such as growth in SMEs within the construction
and renovation industry, urbanization and changing demographics, a growing acceptance of own brand offerings
evidenced through purchases by customers and other key trends.

_Macroeconomic Trends_

General macroeconomic trends such as GDP and interest rates affect demand for construction and renovation in
different ways. For instance, when GDP growth is high, people have greater confidence in the economy and hence they
may build or renovate houses and purchase more building products. According to a leading management consulting firm,
GDP is expected to grow across the Nordics in the coming years at a CAGR of 0.8% in Finland and 2.6% in Sweden,
each from the period from 2016 to 2019, with the largest increase expected in Sweden due to expansionary monetary
policy. Norway’s GDP is expected to rebound due to a monetary and fiscal stimulus, while slower growth is expected in
Finland due to lower domestic demand.

Private consumption also affects the building material distribution market. According to a leading management
consulting firm, the share of personal income allocated to buying construction materials is relatively stable, implying a
high correlation between general consumption and the construction and renovation retail market. Private consumption is
forecasted to grow at CAGRs of 1.5%, 2.4%, 1.9% and 1.9% in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, respectively,
between 2016 and 2019.

Consumer confidence is closely related to private consumption. Greater consumer confidence implies increased
spending and less saving, which has a positive effect on the construction materials distribution market. OECD, a leading
management consulting firm and industry experts expect that the increase in consumer confidence experienced across
the Nordics in recent years will continue until 2018 across all four countries in which we operate.

Movements in lending interest rates have a marginal impact on STARK Group’s market. While a decrease in
rates is beneficial, higher rates reduce household income and consumption, thus leading to increased savings and higher
mortgage costs, which can have an unfavorable effect on construction and renovation activity. Sweden’s Riksbank has
recently kept the repo rate negative, while rates are expected to be low both in the Euro area, as reaffirmed by the ECB
in March 2017, and in Norway. By contrast, the Danish Central Bank increased rates for the first time in two years in
2016.

_Regulatory_

Regulatory initiatives, namely subsidies, tax rate changes and government investments, have an impact on both
regulatory macro trends such as GDP as well as on the type and volume of construction and renovation activity.

Government subsidies increase the attractiveness of new construction investments as well as RMI works among
households and municipalities. In Denmark, the minimum down-payment threshold was preliminarily decreased from
14% to 10% in July 2012, with the ambition to increase the threshold to 14% again in 2017. However, the Ministry of
Immigration and Integration has recently submitted a proposal to extend the preliminary period by two more years until
2019. Low down-payment requirements allow municipalities to build more social housing under unchanged budget
restrictions, hence generating a positive effect on total construction activity and, ultimately, on the construction materials
distribution market.

The RMI market is typically able to benefit from European energy policies that have recently aimed to reduce
energy consumption in the building sector toward zero carbon emission buildings and stricter European building
regulations that also aim to standardize a high quality indoor climate to improve residents’ health. Such European and
national building regulations and energy policies are expected to increase the demand for building material products in
the Nordics because existing buildings, particularly buildings built in the 1960’s and 1970’s, that are not able to meet
these requirements will require renovation. For instance, the Danish government allows tax deductions of up to DKK
12,000 for home-improvement and other RMI expenses, provided that the projects undertaken include a “green” aspect,
such as improvements in energy-efficiency. In Sweden, the ROT policy allows a tax deduction of up to 30% of the labor
costs incurred in relation to RMI works carried out on one’s property. In Finland, the government offers a subsidy for
RMI construction works aimed at improving and promoting home living for elderly or disabled people.

Government investments, ranging from social housing to renovations of schools and other public buildings, fuel
total construction and renovation activity, thus favorably impacting the construction materials distribution space. The
Swedish government has set a target of 600,000 new homes by 2025, and has introduced investment subsidies for the
construction of rental and student accommodation.

94


-----

Taxes directly and indirectly impact private household consumption, consequently affecting the degree to which
new construction and especially renovation works can be financed. In particular, a reduction in taxes, such as on capital
gains, can have a favorable impact on total construction and renovation activity. As an example, the Finnish government
offers a tax refund on some customary renovation labor-related expenditures of up to €2,400 each year per person. The
refund has been in place since 1997 and is not expected to change substantially in the coming years.

_Sector-Specific Trends_

In addition to the growth of the underlying construction materials distribution market, current sector-specific
trends are expected to offer additional growth, according to a leading management consulting firm. In particular, the
shift towards high-growth SME customers, the growing trend towards urbanization and a change in demographics, the
increased penetration of higher-margin own brand products and other key trends are expected to drive future growth in
the building material distribution space.

SME Growth

SMEs, STARK Group’s core customer group, represented approximately 50% of the total Nordic construction
materials distribution market’s gross profit pool in 2016, while private consumers, large contractors and other customers
accounted for approximately 24%, 13% and 13%, respectively, according to a leading management consulting firm.

SMEs are forecasted to outgrow the market in the coming years and generate gross profit growth at a CAGR of
approximately 3% between 2016 and 2021, above total market gross profit growth of approximately 1.8%. The change
in consumer preferences towards full-service providers is expected to shift growth away from DIY and towards SMEs.
The regulatory environment is also expected to favor SME growth, as tax deductions on RMI works in Denmark and
Sweden will continue to incentivize the use of SMEs by households when carrying out home renovation or improvement
works. In addition, growth in SMEs is further supported by overall improved economic conditions across the Nordics.
The Rockwool Foundation found that the share of households who have worked on smaller DIY projects in Denmark has
fallen from approximately 49% in 1996 to approximately 37% in 2007 and 24% in 2016.

Urbanization and Changing Demographics

Internal migration from rural areas and smaller towns towards larger city centers will be one of the key mediumterm drivers of both residential and non-residential construction and renovation activity, according to a leading
management consulting firm. In fact, as people move to cities for study or job related reasons, demand for new housing
as well as for RMI works on the existing stock is expected to increase. Along the same lines, construction and renovation
activity in the public, commercial and industrial sectors will also benefit.

According to a leading management consulting firm, the growing urbanization trend underpins the expectation of
larger regions and cities to outgrow the rest of the market, thereby representing one of the key reasons behind the shift in
growth in favor of distributors with attractive locations closer to large city centers. STARK Group is well-positioned to
benefit from such trends, given its footprint is strategically skewed towards attractive growth areas across its four
markets.

Changing demographics can also affect the growth of the Nordic construction materials distribution market. An
aging population tends to lead to a shift away from DIY toward the hiring of SMEs and other of our B2B customers for
new build and RMI needs. Management believes since wealth may increase with age, an older population may also be
more able and willing to spend on new build and RMI activities than a younger population.

Own Brand Penetration

Own brand products currently have low penetration in the Nordic construction materials distribution market, but
is expected to experience substantial growth in the coming years, according to a leading management consulting firm.
Own brand products in the Nordics are estimated by such firm to hold approximately 10% of the relevant market share,
which is considerably less than other developed countries, primarily due to the smaller scale of Scandinavian enterprises
and a general lack of historical focus on such products. Own brand products have a market share, for example, of
approximately 31% in France, 29% in Germany, 22% in the Netherlands and 20% in the United Kingdom. As a result,
based on a leading management consulting firm, we estimate own brand products will double their relevant market share
in the Nordics by 2020. Future growth is expected to be driven mainly by (i) opportunities for distributors to realize
higher margins on average for own brand SKUs as compared to branded SKUs, and (ii) growing customer willingness to
purchase own brand products, with more than 50% of customers willing to purchase up to half of their baskets in own

95


-----

brand products. Future growth is expected to be driven to a lesser extent by (i) the ability to differentiate against
competitors, (ii) lower reliance on national manufacturer brands, (iii) increased control over product launch and market
positioning, and (iv) the opportunity to actively manage the products’ life cycle.

According to a leading management consulting firm, the product categories that are expected to be most
impacted by the own brand trend are those with a few high-selling SKUs where brand is less important, such as
fasteners, paint, clothing, basic building supplies, hand tools and interior joinery. By contrast, the impact on other
categories such as power tools, wood and plumbing is forecasted to be milder, primarily due to the brand value and high
quality requirements generally associated to these products.


**Addressable Market of STARK Group**

Within the broader residential and non-residential construction and renovation market, the Nordic building
materials retail and distribution space, where end-users can purchase products directly from manufacturers or,
alternatively, from builders’ merchants and other distributors, was estimated at approximately €49 billion in 2016.


Direct sales, specialized distribution and niche retail represent approximately 61% of the total Nordic
construction materials distribution market, or approximately €30 billion, while retailers and builders’ merchants, like
STARK Group, comprise the remaining 39%, or approximately €19.3 billion. Of this addressable market of
approximately €19.3 billion in which STARK Group operates, approximately €7.1 billion come from Sweden,
approximately €4.8 billion from Norway, approximately €4.3 billion from Denmark and approximately €3.1 billion from
Finland.

The building material distribution landscape in which STARK Group operates consists of product manufacturers,
distributors and customers, including B2B customers as well as B2C customers. The manufacturer, B2B customer and
B2C customer base tend to be highly fragmented. Individual manufacturers therefore have either limited ambition or
capabilities to sell directly to B2B customers and B2C customers without the assistance of distributors, except in cases
of very large orders by big customer accounts where the economics make sense. However, even in these situations,
distributors can provide invoicing, credit, processing and other services, thus acting as key connectors between
manufacturers and B2B customers. As a result, distributors like STARK Group act as indispensable aggregators in the
value chain, providing manufacturers with a cost-efficient and effective distribution channel and providing B2B
customers and B2C customers with efficient sourcing, product expertise, timely availability of products and product
aggregation.

_Competitive Landscape_

Overall Market

The competitive landscape within the Nordic construction materials distribution market broadly includes general
and specialized professional builders’ merchants, “big box” DIY retailers, DIY discounters, traditional DIY retailers and
online DIY retailers, but STARK Group competes primarily with other general professional builders’ merchants.

     - **General professional builders’ merchants, to which category STARK Group belongs, are mainly focused**
on B2B customers, such as large construction companies and especially SMEs. General professional
builders’ merchants generally cover several product categories under leading branded products and own
brand products as well as provide high levels of customer service, including through their own distribution
and sales network of central and well-developed warehouses and logistics networks.

     - **Specialized professional builders’ merchants are distinctly focused on B2B customers, and their value**
proposition is centered around excellent customer and distribution services. Large specialized professional
builders’ merchants tend to be international companies focused on one product category. Small specialized
professional builders’ merchants tend to be local or regional distributors focused on one product category
with a largely regional sales force. Multi-specialist professional builders’ merchants tend to cover several
product categories and have their own distribution and sales networks.

     - **DIY retailers hold a small piece of the market and have limited distribution capacity and sales forces. “Big**
**box” DIY retailers are generally present in large cities with prime store locations, such as retail parks, and**
offer a wide product assortment, while customer service is generally not prioritized. DIY discounters,
**traditional DIY retailers and online DIY retailers focus on private consumers and offer discount to**
premium products and brands, as well as different levels of customer service. DIY discounters offer secondtier and own brand products at the lowest prices, and are mainly located in large retail parks. By contrast,
online DIY retailers generally have only few physical stores, offer tier-one products at higher prices and
generate over 80% of sales through their online channels.

STARK Group’s main competitors are Woody, Bygma, Optimera, Kesko and XL Byg. Of these, only Bygma
and Optimera are non-franchise builders’ merchants like STARK Group, while Woody and XL Byg are purchasing

partnerships, and Kesko is a retail conglomerate operating according to a mixed model and managing and developing a
number of distribution chains in the Nordics, such as K-Rauta and Byggmakker. The franchise structure, including of
XL Byg and Woody which are substantially a collection of “mom and pop” shops united in buying groups, does not
allow full benefits from scale advantages, such as efficient sourcing or wide product assortment, which represent key
success factors in the construction materials distribution business.

Focus on Denmark

The construction materials distribution market in Denmark is largely fragmented and made up of both B2B and
B2C competitors. STARK DK’s main competitors within the Danish market include XL Byg and Bygma. XL Byg is a
DIY and professional builders’ merchant like STARK Group, but operates as a purchasing partnership of independent
stores, which can imply a number of disadvantages from a sourcing, logistical and overall strategy perspective since
branches may be in competition with one another. By contrast, Bygma is a company-owned distributor with a high-end
product assortment, targeting B2B customers and, to a lesser extent, B2C customers. The majority of its stores are
located close to large cities, but it is also present in smaller towns and in the countryside. Bygma has a business model
most comparable to that of STARK Group.

Based on revenue for the year ended July 31, 2016, management estimates STARK DK is the largest
non-franchise builders’ merchant in Denmark. Including procurement cooperatives and franchises, management

estimates STARK DK is the second largest general builders’ merchant in Denmark by revenue. For the year ended
July 31, 2016, management estimates STARK DK has held 20% market share in Denmark (calculated on a national
market basis), with STARK DK’s largest competitors, XL Byg and Bygma, having held 27% and 14%, respectively.

Focus on Sweden

The construction materials distribution market in Sweden is largely fragmented and made up of both B2B and
B2C competitors, with approximately 58% of the market comprising players with less than 1% market share according
to a leading management consulting firm. Beijer’s main competitors in the Swedish market are XL Bygg and Woody.
Like XL Bygg, Woody is a purchasing partnership of independent stores offering a high-end product assortment and
targeting B2B customers as well as B2C customers.

Based on revenue for the year ended July 31, 2016, management estimates Beijer is the largest non-franchise
builders’ merchant in Sweden. Including procurement cooperatives and franchises, management estimates Beijer is the
third largest general builders’ merchant in Sweden by revenue. For the year ended July 31, 2016, management estimates
Beijer has held 8% market share in Sweden (calculated on a national market basis), with Beijer’s largest competitors, XL
Bygg and Woody having held 11% and 10%, respectively.

Focus on Finland

The construction materials distribution market in Finland is largely fragmented and made up of both B2B and
B2C competitors. STARK FI’s primary competitors are Kesko (or K-Group) and the retail cooperative, S-Ryhmä (or
S-Group). Kesko competes in Finland under a franchise model mainly through its managed companies, K-Rauta and
Rautia (whose stores recently all moved under the K-Rauta brand), while S-Ryhmä competes through its subsidiaries,
Kodin Terra and Rauta-Prisma. Both Kesko and S-Ryhmä target B2B customers as well as B2C customers. However,
S-Ryhmä’s Kodin Terra and Rauta-Prisma stores are primarily focused on private consumers in large and medium sized
cities, while Kesko’s K-Rauta stores have a substantial geographical coverage, from large branches in major cities to
small branches in rural areas.

Based on revenue for the year ended July 31, 2016, management estimates STARK FI is the largest
non-franchise builders’ merchant in Finland. Including procurement cooperatives and franchises, management estimates
STARK FI is the second largest general builders’ merchant in Finland by revenue. For the year ended July 31, 2016,
management estimates STARK FI has held 18% market share in Finland (calculated on a national market basis), with
STARK FI’s largest competitors, K-Group and S-Group, having held 31% and 10%, respectively.

Focus on Norway

The construction materials distribution market in Norway is largely fragmented and made up of both B2B and
B2C competitors. Neumann’s key competitors within the Norwegian construction materials distribution market are
Kesko, Optimera and Maxbo. Kesko competes through its subsidiary Byggmakker, while Maxbo is fully-owned by
Løvenskiold-Vækerø AS and operates as a combination of franchise and non-franchise operations.

Based on revenue for the year ended July 31, 2016, management estimates Neumann is the largest non-franchise
builders’ merchant in Bergen, Tromsø and southwestern Norway. For the year ended July 31, 2016, management
estimates Neumann has held 3% market share in Norway (calculated on a national market basis), with Neumann’s
largest competitors, Optimera, Byggmakker, COOP OBS Bygg and Maxbo, having held 21%, 14%, 11% and 10%,
respectively.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics. We directly operate a total of 179 branches
across Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Greenland from which we serve our diversified customer base of small
and medium-sized enterprises, which comprise our core customer group, as well as large construction companies, private
consumers and other types of customers, such as public authorities. We benefit from significant operational advantages
compared to our competitors, which are mostly “mom and pop” shops collaborating in buying groups and franchiseeowned operations. As a result, our competitors generally cannot match the combination of our harmonized sourcing
capabilities across the Nordics, collaborative customer service network and convenient national and cross-regional
product availability.

We operate four business units across the Nordics and as of October 31, 2017, we directly operated 66 branches
in Denmark, with an additional six branches in Greenland, under our STARK DK business unit, 27 branches in Finland
under our STARK FI business unit, 66 branches in Sweden under our Beijer business unit and 14 branches in Norway
under our Neumann business unit.

The following charts show the shares of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and total gross profit, excluding profit
allocated to our headquarters, for the Ongoing Business by business unit for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017:

Our customers primarily purchase our products for use in the resilient RMI market which has shown stable
growth during 14 out of the past 17 years across the Nordic region. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017,
management estimates that we generated approximately 60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and
approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from RMI activities and approximately 40% of total
revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from new build
activity. Our resilient cash flow during our last three years has also benefitted from our stable gross margin, variable cost
structure and effective working capital management. Our variable cost structure has allowed us to reduce labor costs,
unwind working capital and reduce capital expenditures during the most recent economic downturn.

In each of our markets, we seek to offer our customers a broad range of branded and own brand products,
consisting of heavy building materials, timber and panels, tools and hardware, flooring and joinery, light-side and other

To differentiate our business from our competitors, boost our ability to execute range innovation, control product
lifecycles and reduce our dependency on national manufacturer brands, we continue to focus on expanding the
penetration of our own brand SKUs, which have higher gross margins on average than branded SKUs, according to
management estimates. As of October 31, 2017, our own brand portfolio comprised 4,110 SKUs spread across our four
brands, Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics. We believe we are well-positioned to have the widest own brand offering in
the Nordics as a result of our size, scale and level of coordination across countries. In the twelve months ended
October 31, 2017, we derived approximately 91% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from branded products and
approximately 9% from our own brand products.

We support our 179 strategically located branches through our extensive logistics platform, which includes five
ship hubs, one light-side hub, five central distribution centers, approximately 120 delivery trucks that we directly operate
and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs, allowing for
proximity to our customers and harmonized delivery capabilities across the Nordics. Leveraging our broad physical
footprint, we offer our customers three distinct sales channels: stock collected by customers inside our branches, stock
delivered by us to our customers from our facilities, including weekday delivery within 24 hours in Denmark, and direct
delivery by us to customers from the manufacturer’s facilities. To maximize accessibility of our products across all of
our markets, we also support our operations through a variety of digitalized customer services under our online sales
platforms, including online and mobile phone order, product search and price comparison capabilities.

In the year ended July 31, 2017, after our CEO, Søren P. Olesen, stepped into the role of Group-wide CEO from
his previous position with STARK DK, we implemented our “Back to Basics” strategy which comprises a number of
strategic initiatives to refocus our business on our core SME customer group, reduce sourcing and operational costs,
build a more efficient branch and logistics network and streamline our leadership structure by enhancing local decision
making and accountability. Management estimates that these programs, together with improvements in the market, have
already had a positive effect on our revenue and earnings during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017.

As of October 31, 2017, we had 5,056 FTEs and a total headcount of 5,667 personnel, and in the twelve months
ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue for the Ongoing Business of €2,183 million and Run-rate Adjusted
EBITDA for the Ongoing Business of €109 million, and achieved a Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Ongoing
Business of 5%.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that the following strengths have been instrumental in our success and position us for future growth:

**_Strong Construction and Renovation Market Fundamentals and Outlook_**

We believe that our leading market position across the Nordics has allowed us to benefit from the strong
fundamentals of the Nordic construction and renovation market. Historically, the construction and renovation market in
the Nordics has exhibited stable growth, expanding at a CAGR of 2.4% from 2000 to 2016 according to Euroconstruct,
and proving to be among the most resilient markets during the most recent global economic downturn according to
Euroconstruct.

The Nordic construction materials distribution market is driven by total construction and renovation activity,
which in turn is driven by a variety of factors, including, among others: (i) macroeconomic trends, namely GDP, private
consumption, consumer confidence and interest rates, and (ii) regulatory initiatives, such as subsidies and tax deductions
on new construction or renovation works. Additionally, the Nordic construction materials distribution market is expected
to benefit from a number of sector-specific trends which are expected to outperform the general construction and
renovation market, according to a leading management consulting firm. Such sector-specific trends include, among other
key trends, (i) growth in SMEs within the construction and renovation industry, (ii) urbanization and changing
demographics and (iii) a growing acceptance of own brand offerings evidenced through purchases by customers.

According to Euroconstruct, the Nordic RMI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7%
between 2016 and 2019. In particular, the Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian RMI markets are forecasted to grow
at CAGRs of approximately 2.1%, 0.9%, 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, over the same period. According to
Euroconstruct, the Nordic new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 4.1% over the period
from 2016 to 2019. In particular, the Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian new build markets are forecasted to grow
at CAGRs of approximately 6.3%, 7.1%, 0.7% and 2.6%, respectively, over the same period.

**_Significant Exposure to Structurally Resilient RMI Market Across the Nordics_**

In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, management estimates RMI activity accounted for approximately
60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business, and
new build activity accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25%
of gross profit for the Ongoing Business, respectively.

The construction and renovation market in the Nordics comprises both the RMI sector and the new build sector,
and our business benefits from our significant exposure to the structurally resilient RMI sector. RMI activities in the
Nordics are significantly less affected by market fluctuations, showing more than eight times less variance in growth
rates than the new build sector according to a leading management consulting firm. RMI activity across our core markets
has shown stable through-the-cycle growth during 14 out of the past 17 years, growing at CAGRs of approximately
1.6% from 2000 to 2016 according to Euroconstruct.

**_Leading Position in the Nordics_**

We are the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics. We hold the number one position among
non-franchise builders’ merchants in the Nordics, with 11% market share based on revenue in the year ended July 31,
2016, compared to 7% market shares for the next leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics, Optimera,
according to management estimates. Management estimates that STARK DK, our most profitable business unit, holds
the number one position among non-franchise builders’ merchants in Denmark, with 20% market share (calculated on a
national market basis) based on revenue in the year ended July 31, 2016, compared to 14% market shares for the next
leading non-franchise builders’ merchants in Denmark, Bygma. Management estimates that STARK FI holds the
number one position among non-franchise builders’ merchants in Finland, with 18% market share (calculated on a
national market basis) based on revenue in the year ended July 31, 2016, compared to 10% market share for the next

leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in Finland, S-Ryhmä. Management estimates that Beijer holds the number one
position among non-franchise builders’ merchants in Sweden, with 8% market share (calculated on a national market
basis) based on revenue in the year ended July 31, 2016, which is a greater share than each other non-franchise builders’
merchant in Sweden that collectively hold 70% of the B2B and B2C market in Sweden. Management estimates that
Neumann holds the number one position among non-franchise builders’ merchants in Bergen, Tromsø and southwestern
Norway, with an overall 3% market share (calculated on a national market basis) based on revenue in the year ended
July 31, 2016, compared to an overall 21% market share for the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in Norway,
Optimera.

**_Competitive Advantages_**

We believe our scale, branch network, logistics platform, full ownership structure and broad customer-centric
product and service offering harmonized across the Nordics create competitive advantages and provide us with
significant operational advantages compared to our competitors. Our business benefits from an extensive network of 179
branches across the Nordics that are strategically located in areas with high population density and limited available
additional real estate, making it difficult for potential competitors to replicate our footprint and customer reach in our
core markets. Additionally, operating a company-owned network of branches allows us to harmonize our product
assortment and manage our product availability across our business, resulting in superior product assortment and
availability in branches and via delivery while simultaneously enabling optimized working capital levels. For instance,
STARK DK promises product availability on a certain core range of approximately 1,000 SKUs, which if not available
in-branch, will be delivered to our customers in Denmark within four hours and free of charge. Leveraging our scale, we
also benefit from significant harmonized sourcing capabilities across the Nordics which allow us to streamline our
sourcing efforts and negotiate better pricing terms with our suppliers. We are thus able to provide better pricing to our
customers and optimize cost to serve to improve our competitiveness in the market. In addition to our branch network,
we fully control an extensive logistics platform consisting of five ship hubs, one light-side hub, five central distribution
centers, approximately 120 delivery trucks that we directly operate and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks
across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs, which allows for proximity to our customers and enables us to
meet our customers’ demand for flexible collection and delivery services on a national and cross-regional basis. As of
October 31, 2017, we had a deep and loyal customer base of approximately 29,000 active customers, which we define as
customers who have spent more than €5,000 on our products and services in the year ended July 31, 2017. As of
October 31, 2017, we support our customers with a dedicated sales force of more than 850 employees, excluding branch
sales staff and office sales support staff, as well as tailored post-sale service offerings, such as credit accounts. We
believe that operating a company-owned network of branches allows us to share best customer service practice across
branches and provides our customers with consistently high service.

Additionally, we believe that we face only a limited threat from pure-play online retailers who lack the physical
store footprint to provide the in-person specialist advice that is important to our customers in their purchasing decisions
as well as the special infrastructure required to deliver heavy-side building materials, which make up a significant
portion of the products we sell. Heavy building materials and timber and panels possess low value to weight ratios,
which have historically proved to be unprofitable for pure-play online retailers. We also believe that pure-play online
retailers are unable to meet our customers’ requirement for personalized relationships and post-sale services, including
our ability to offer customers individualized pricing options and sales discounts, customer credit options, complex
logistics solutions, in-branch advice, in-person technical support and quicker access to products, maintenance services
and replacement products.

**_Diversified Business Model_**

We sell to a diversified customer base who use our products in a variety of end markets and to which we offer
varied sales channels. Collectively, this diversification provides downside protection in times of cyclicality and thus
comprises key drivers of resilience of our business.

We have established strong, long-lasting relationships with a wide range of customers, including SMEs, which
comprise our core customer group, as well as large construction companies, private consumers and other types of
customers, such as public authorities. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top 20 customers only
generated approximately 7% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 3% of gross profit for the
Ongoing Business, with the remaining approximately 93% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately
97% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business being generated by a long tail of customers, including SME customers for
whom STARK Group is a critical supplier. Our fragmented customer base is further diversified in that both small and
large customers often have a variety of product preferences and requirements, purchasing from multiple product
categories, frequently and in small quantities, making our role as a “one stop shop” for our core customer groups
particularly important.

103


-----

In addition to low customer concentration, our business benefits from a diversified mix of sales channels
designed to maximize the accessibility of our products, including: (i) stock collected by customers inside our branches,
(ii) stock delivered by us to our customers from our facilities, and (iii) direct delivery by us to customers from the
manufacturer’s facilities. In the year ended July 31, 2017, we generated approximately 38%, 29% and 33% of total
revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 60%, 27% and 13% of total gross margin for the Ongoing Business
from our stock collected, stock delivered and direct delivery channels, respectively.

Furthermore, our business benefits from geographic diversification, which enables us to capitalize on the
different macroeconomic growth drivers of our core markets of Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway. As the different
growth drivers experience peaks and troughs at different times, our business benefits from more stable through-the-cycle
revenue generation. In addition, as the Nordic region as a whole may experience a separate economic cycle, our business
benefits from resistance to national economic cycles, which is a stabilizing factor with respect to our revenue.

Lastly, we are exposed to a diverse supplier base and are not dependent on a single supplier for the operation of
our business. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top ten suppliers, excluding unmapped suppliers,
accounted for approximately 28% of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business, with no one supplier accounting
for 10% or more of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business.

**_High Customer Retention due to Steady Base of Loyal SME Customers and Best-in-Class Product and Relationship_**
**_Offerings_**

We rely on a deep and loyal base of SME customers who exhibit frequent purchasing patterns with respect to our
products and services. As of October 31, 2017, our active customer base of 29,000 customers, which we define as
customers who have spent more than €5,000 on our products and services in the year ended July 31, 2017, had an
average life of 9.8, 7.5, 6.0 and 8.3 years in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway, respectively. According to exit
interviews of 119 customers of STARK DK, Bygma or XL Byg, conducted by a leading management consulting firm in
2016, about 83% of our customers in Denmark purchase our products at least once a week.

SMEs represent our largest gross profit pool, and we estimate SMEs represent a higher percentage of our revenue
for the Ongoing Business than the percentage of revenue generated by SMEs in the total Nordic construction materials
distribution market. We continue to provide SMEs with a leading assortment of products and services, guaranteed
availability of key products and more favorable pricing and credit terms when compared to our competitors. For
example, compared to our competitors, we believe we offer our SME customers the best warranty and loyalty benefits.
On average, our SME customers have shopped with us for approximately ten years in Denmark and approximately eight
years in Sweden.

**_Value of Business is Underpinned by Owned Real Estate Portfolio_**

We own an extensive portfolio of 195 freehold properties with more than 1,000,000 square meters of space and
an average gross leasable area of 5,820 square meters, including 153 properties at which we operate branches, covering
key above-market growth areas across the Nordics. Given the large portion of owned branches, our business benefits
from low impact from rent expenses on our cash flow when compared to our competitors across Europe as we do not
have a fixed monthly cash outflow with respect to such rent expenses. In the year ended July 31, 2017, management
estimates that external rent accounted for only 14% of our EBITDA for the Ongoing Business. By contrast, external rent
represented approximately 20% and 37% of EBITDA for Ahlsell and Byggmax, respectively, during each of their 2016
financial years. In addition, as a result of our owned property portfolio, a large portion of our capital expenditures is
discretionary as we can generally decide the timing of any improvements to such properties, and we have historically
had the flexibility to reduce our capital expenditures during economic downturns.

As of September 30, 2017, our freehold real estate portfolio was independently valued at up to €805 million,
covering over 150% of our indebtedness for the Ongoing Business after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions.

**_Variable Cost Structure Provides Resilient Earnings and Cash Flow_**

Our cost structure has historically provided us with significant downside protection during periods of adverse
economic conditions. Given the intrinsic nature of a distributor business, approximately 90% of our cost base is either
directly linked to sales (such as cost of sales and fleet costs), or is considered by management to have a high potential for
short-term right-sizing (such as employee costs related to employees with flexible contracts and fleet costs). Our fixed
costs mainly relate to the fixed portion of our employee costs, including our base employee and pension costs,
administrative expenses and other fixed costs, such as costs related to IT functions. Additionally, we have historically

104


-----

been able to further adjust our cost structure during economic downturns by rationalizing discretionary costs related to
advertisement, infrastructure, administration and IT, which allowed us to maintain stable margins between 2006 and
2011 compared to a number of our key competitors. The following chart provides an overview of the drop in peak and
trough EBITDA margin and EBIT margin of a number of building material distributors as well as selected Nordic
manufacturers of building material products:

(1) We define absolute drop in EBITDA margin and EBIT margin as the difference between peak and trough margins. We define the peak period as
between 2006 and 2008 and we define the trough period as between 2008 and 2011.

_Note: The financial data presented in this table is not calendarized. STARK’s EBITDA margin and EBIT margin are based on Ferguson’s Nordics_
financials as reported by Ferguson in its consolidated financial statements, and exclude the year ended July 31, 2016 due to unavailable public
data. STARK’s EBITDA margin and EBIT margin are not directly comparable to the EBITDA margin and EBIT margin, respectively, of the
Target for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, due to subsequent changes in STARK’s business, including as a result of the Branch
Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data.” EBITDA margin and EBIT margin for
STARK’s competitors are based on publicly available information, and STARK’s competitors may calculate EBITDA margin and EBIT margin
differently from STARK. As a result, STARK’s EBITDA margin and EBIT margin for the periods indicated herein may not be comparable to
the EBITDA margin and EBIT margin of its competitors.

Additionally, the rigorous management of our working capital, including through the tightening of credit controls
and improvement of payment terms with suppliers, and our flexible capital expenditure levels, have historically allowed
us to generate significant cash flows, resulting in a cash conversion rate, defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing
Business less adjusted capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, of 72%, 70% and
61% for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We believe that our efficient working capital
management will allow us to continue maintaining resilient financial performance going forward.

**_Experienced Management Team Has Refocused Our Business and Introduced Cost Saving Initiatives_**

Our business is supported by an experienced management team, including, for instance, our CEO, Søren P.
Olesen, and our Business Development Director, Daniel R. Potok, with a combined 39 years of experience in the
construction and renovation and retail industries. Mr. Olesen, who stepped into the role of Group-wide CEO in
November 2016, brings with him 24 years of experience in the construction and renovation industry, including three

years as CEO of STARK DK. Our Business Development Director, Daniel R. Potok, who recently joined the Group,
brings with him more than 15 years of experience in the professional service sector advising leading Nordic and
European builders’ merchants and retailers. Our senior management team is supported by the CEOs and managing
directors of each of our business units, comprising a leadership team with significant industry experience.

In the year ended July 31, 2017, following a comprehensive review of our leadership position in the Nordic
construction materials distribution markets, our customer value propositions and the management of our operations, our
CEO together with other members of senior management began implementing our “Back to Basics” strategic plan,
incorporating clearly defined cost saving and efficiency initiatives. Our “Back to Basics” initiatives aim to drive our
top-line growth by creating a customer centric business model refocusing our operations on our SME core customer
group, enhance our profitability by streamlining our headquarters and central administration functions, enforcing crossfunctional collaboration between our headquarters and business units and driving better sourcing initiatives through
leveraging our scale, and rationalizing our footprint by exiting unprofitable branches and locations and simplifying our
distribution network.

**_Implementation of Strategic Initiatives Has Yielded Positive Results_**

In connection with our “Back to Basics” strategy, to increase focus on our SME segment, we exited our Silvan
DIY business in 2017 and developed and launched a new SME marketing campaign to leverage our fastest growing
profit pool. Additionally, to optimize our physical footprint, in 2017, we closed 30 underperforming branches in low
growth areas to focus our business on regions that are expected to outperform national averages. Furthermore, to
streamline administrative functions, in 2016, we initiated significant downsizing at our headquarters, including the
relocation of 178 FTEs from our central headquarters to the business unit level to clarify responsibilities and increase
accountability and a total planned reduction of 55 FTEs, excluding the hiring of 19 FTEs, expected to be completed by
the end of June 2018. We have also initiated (i) further leveraging of our harmonized sourcing platform across the
Nordics by rationalizing our supplier base to maximize purchasing power, (ii) the expansion of our own brand offerings
to support gross margin development while rationalizing our product portfolio, (iii) the simplification of our distribution
network and reduction of our distribution costs and (iv) the optimization of our branch network with an eye toward
regions where we have identified growing demand for our products. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Cost Saving and Other_
_Strategic Initiatives.”_

We estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate cost savings of approximately €7 million in
the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 through our “Back to Basics” strategy, mainly as a result of better contractual
terms following our renegotiation of key supply contracts and as a result of headcount reductions and a more streamlined
headquarters if these cost saving measures had been implemented on November 1, 2016. Overall, we have identified
approximately €74 million in operational, sourcing- and network-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which
we aim to realize by 2021. Additionally, we have initiated several topline growth initiatives, primarily related to product
assortment, availability and pricing, which management believes, together with improvements in the market, have
resulted in an increase in revenue for the Ongoing Business of approximately 5% during the twelve months ended
October 31, 2017. We believe that our operational improvements have allowed us to outperform the market in each of
Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway in the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017.

**Our Strategy**

Based on our key strengths, our ongoing strategic plan continues to focus primarily on cost-reduction and, to a
lesser extent, growth in our revenue and market share through the following strategies:

**_Better Sourcing_**

To reach our objective of developing better sourcing processes, we are implementing a systematic review of our
supply chain operations by focusing on three key components: (i) our own brand products, (ii) our direct sourcing costs
and (iii) our indirect sourcing costs. We have already begun to implement several initiatives in connection with these key
components, the results of which we expect will positively impact our financial position in the near term.

Historically, there was a lack of focus on our own brand product portfolio and an excessive overlap of our own
brand product proposition with our branded product proposition, with the vast majority of our own brand SKUs not
being shared across our business units. By increasing our focus on own brand products, we intend to increase leverage
with our suppliers and continue supporting our margins, as own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on average than
branded SKUs, according to management estimates. As of October 31, 2017, our own brand portfolio comprised 4,110

106


-----

SKUs spread across our four brands: Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics. We are currently building a strategic common
core range of 800 own brand SKUs which will have reduced overlap with our branded products portfolio. Furthermore,
following our disposal of our Silvan DIY business and in line with refocusing our business on our SME core customer
group, we will continue to reduce the number of our DIY SKUs. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we
derived approximately 9% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from own brand products. Based on independent
market studies, we estimate that own brand products will double their share of the relevant market in the Nordics by
2020, and in line with this estimated growth, we aim to more than double the share of our revenue generated by our own
brand products.

Historically, there was a lack of focus on our direct sourcing costs, including as our business units each defined
product categories independently and entered into individualized Nordic framework agreements with suppliers. As a
result, we only took limited advantage of bundling purchases from suppliers across business units to achieve volume
discounts and partially utilized our eSourcing tool, which aims to optimize efficiency and decrease our sourcing spend
through various internet-enabled sourcing methods to reduce the time spent on in-person price negotiations, collect
pricing data easily and enable high competition among suppliers. In addition, we previously did not track key
performance indicators consistently across business units, preventing us from adequately monitoring and driving
performance. Consequently, we believe there is significant potential for savings with respect to our direct sourcing costs,
and under our “Back to Basics” strategy, we intend to decrease our direct sourcing costs by better leveraging our
position as the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics, while building longer term relationships with
key suppliers to further reduce costs and ensure the quality and security of the supply for a number of our key products.
On August 1, 2017, we launched STARK Group Sourcing, our harmonized sourcing unit across the Nordics, which is
designed to maximize sourcing synergies between our business units through a three-step process of (i) rationalizing our
suppliers, (ii) rationalizing our product assortment and common core range of SKUs and (iii) improving payment terms
with suppliers. We believe STARK Group Sourcing will enable us to benefit from significant economies of scale.
Leveraging a “one door” decision making policy, our sourcing unit will continue to conduct best practice and fact-based
negotiations with suppliers under direct sourcing campaigns, with the aim of further reducing costs and increasing
efficiencies.

Historically, there was a lack of focus on our indirect sourcing costs, leading to decentralized sourcing processes
and unexploited cost saving opportunities in key indirect sourcing areas such as marketing and logistics, IT and facility
management. As part of our “Back to Basics” strategy, we have identified initiatives which we believe will reduce our
indirect sourcing costs with minimal effort. Such initiatives include continuing to streamline our supplier base, creating
performance-based supplier contracts and improving the management of demand for our products and supplies.

We have identified approximately €51 million of sourcing and procurement-related cost savings for the Ongoing
Business, which we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.

**_Stronger Network_**

To enhance our ability to serve customers, we seek to continuously improve our customers’ experience in our
branches by building a stronger branch network and providing more efficient logistics operations and higher availability
of stock. In line with our “Back to Basics” strategic plan, we will continue optimizing the footprint of our branches to
capture the benefit of expected growth in the markets in coming years and increase our competitive advantages. We aim
to increase the accessibility of our branches through facility improvements which are tailored to the needs of our
customers and trends in our markets and aimed to provide consistent and positive customer shopping experiences. While
our business benefits significantly from our current geographic coverage, we may in the future pursue strategic
relocations and consolidations of certain branches to better locations along highly travelled roads benefiting from higher
footfall or visibility and will assess any new branches that we bring into our network on a case-by-case basis. We
continue to monitor our existing branch base to selectively close or merge branches that are performing poorly or
otherwise do not meet our expectations.

To pursue cost saving opportunities, we have identified several measures which we intend to action in the short
term. For instance, we aim to further simplify our distribution network while optimizing our delivery routes and pricing
terms by, among other things, establishing additional ship hubs, developing our recently established light-side hub in
Denmark to streamline the distribution of slow moving items, downsizing and outsourcing certain of our centralized
warehouse processes to achieve cost savings and consolidating the number of dedicated branches used for the
distribution of products to better allocate our resources.

We have identified approximately €13 million of network-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which
we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.

**_Efficient Operator_**

We aim to continue optimizing our operations to create a leaner, more efficient operational structure with
improved support for our business units and reduced costs. In connection with our “Back to Basics” strategy, we have
focused on cost management through reduced overhead costs by having reorganized our managerial structure and
optimized the size of our headquarters, with the aim of strengthening local decision-making and accountability and
regaining focus on day-to-day operations at the business unit and branch level while still maintaining efficiency through
centralized functions from our headquarters, including for strategy, performance, human resources and compliance
across our business.

We have identified approximately €11 million of operational cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which we
aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.

**_Drive Top-Line Growth_**

We intend to continue driving our top-line growth by enhancing our value proposition to SMEs, providing
leading customer services, implementing smart pricing and leveraging our physical assets and industry experience. We
continue working with and for our SME customers to offer better terms and shopping experiences. For instance, we are
rationalizing our product assortment by focusing on trade-specific “high runner” products that SMEs prefer, and
guaranteeing availability of certain core assortments of products to immediately fulfill our customers’ requirements.
With respect to such trade-specific “high runner” products, we aim to improve our smart pricing strategy to maintain a
reputable value perception among our customers and to simultaneously drive movement in inventory and revenue.
Furthermore, we intend to capture digital growth opportunities by leveraging our existing physical network of branches
and logistics facilities, as well as industry experience and product expertise and improving our online platform for SMEs
to quickly, efficiently and comprehensively serve and advise our customers on the best products for each of their
projects’ needs. In connection with these strategic initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to increase revenue and
profitability as we continue capitalizing on our scale and competitive advantages.

**Our History**

We were founded as Aarhus Trælasthandel A/S in 1896. To increase our presence in the construction materials
distribution markets of the Nordics, we have since expanded our retail trade business operations through a strategy of
acquiring new businesses and opening new branches in our existing business units. Key acquisitions included Beijer in
Sweden in 1989, Neumann in Norway in 1997 and Starkki in Finland in 2000.

We were acquired in a take-private transaction by CVC in 2003 and sold to Ferguson, which then operated as
Wolseley Plc, in 2006. In March 2017, in connection with Ferguson’s strategic decision to refocus its business towards
the United States, including by changing its reporting currency and name from Wolseley Plc to Ferguson, Ferguson
elected to sell its Nordics business. Ferguson’s Nordics business represented a small part of its larger operations scheme,
with its Nordics business receiving less focus than its other business segments. In connection with Ferguson’s
realignment initiatives, Ferguson agreed to sell STARK Group to Lone Star and we currently expect the Acquisition to
close in the spring of 2018.

In the year ended July 31, 2017, after our CEO, Søren P. Olesen, stepped into the role of Group-wide CEO from
his previous position with STARK DK, we began implementing our “Back to Basics” strategy, which is aimed at
significant footprint rationalization, reducing operational costs, leveraging our scale to improve our procurement and
logistics platforms, organizational and managerial structural changes and growth through calculated acquisitions and
disposals as well as marketing. For instance, during the year ended July 31, 2017, we closed 30 underperforming
branches in low growth regions in order to regain better focus on our core business. In addition, in July 2017, we
announced our agreement to divest our DIY brand, Silvan, in order to focus primarily on B2B customers and particularly
to refocus on SMEs, our core customer group.

**Our Business**

We are the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics. Our competitors in our largest markets are
mostly “mom and pop” shops collaborating in buying groups, such as XL Byg and Woody, and large builders’
merchants operating under a franchise model, such as Kesko, S-Ryhmä and Byggmakker, as well as niche companies
and local retailers. We have established a strong position in the market through our geographical diversification, which
provides key scale advantages, and our broad range of product offerings for both RMI activities and new build activities.
Our business benefits from a large and varied customer base, including SMEs, our core customer group, as well as large
construction companies, private consumers and other types of customers, such as public authorities, and we supply our
products to our customers through fully company-owned physical branches, telephone and mail order channels and
online, providing delivery services across all four key Nordic countries in which we operate. We provide three distinct s

108

ales channels for the convenience of our customers: stock collected by customers inside our branches, stock delivered by
us to our customers from our facilities and direct delivery by the manufacturer to customers from the manufacturer’s
facilities.

As of October 31, 2017, we directly operated all 179 of our branches, comprising 66 branches in Denmark, with
an additional six branches in Greenland, under our STARK DK business unit, 27 branches in Finland under our STARK
FI business unit, 66 branches in Sweden under our Beijer business unit and 14 branches in Norway under our Neumann
business unit. Of the 179 properties at which we operate each of our branches, we own 153, or 85%, of such properties
and we lease 26, or 15%, of such properties.

An overview of each of our four business units, as of and for the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, is set
forth in the table below:

(1) Gross profit for the Ongoing Business per business unit excludes profit allocated to our headquarters.

**Business Units**

We operate four business units, STARK DK, STARK FI, Beijer and Neumann. Each of our business units offers
a wide product range from each of our core product categories to meet the preferences and needs of our core customers
in the respective country of operation.

**_STARK DK_**

STARK DK, our most profitable business unit, is the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in Denmark.
Management believes STARK DK benefits from strong brand awareness and high customer loyalty when compared to
competitors.

In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, STARK DK’s share of the revenue for the Ongoing Business was
€899 million, accounting for 41% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and STARK DK’s share of the gross profit,
excluding profit allocated to our headquarters, for the Ongoing Business was €225 million, accounting for 42% of total
gross profit for the Ongoing Business.

As of October 31, 2017, we directly operated 66 STARK DK branches, of which we owned the properties for 58
such branches, in attractive locations across Denmark, including all major cities such as Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense
and Aalborg, as well as in strategic locations in rural areas in Denmark. Additionally, we directly operated six STARK
DK branches on leased properties in strategic locations in Greenland. The following map shows our nationwide network
of STARK DK branches across Denmark.

_Note: There are an additional six STARK DK branches in Greenland._

While STARK DK serves two main types of customers, SMEs and large construction companies, its largest
customer base comprises SMEs. We believe our STARK DK branches are uniquely positioned to capture SME growth
in attractive growth regions in Denmark as compared to its competitors. We focus our marketing strategies to enhance
customer loyalty among SMEs. As part of our “Back to Basics” strategy, we have also initiated and, in certain cases,
completed enhancements to our STARK DK product portfolio to have greater focus on underpenetrated product
categories which we believe are important to SMEs, such as doors and windows, roofing, floors and tiles, paint and
sealing, climate and façades, workwear and locks and brackets.

As of October 31, 2017, STARK DK offered a wide range of total SKUs, with a tailored range of approximately
25,000 SKUs accounting for the majority of STARK DK’s revenues. STARK DK offers high availability on a basic
assortment of approximately 5,000 SKUs and guaranteed availability of approximately 1,000 SKUs. STARK DK is
continuing to optimize its product assortment with the aim of completing the updated product assortment range by the
end of 2018. While STARK DK offers products from each of our core product categories, the heavy building materials
product category generates the largest share of its revenue. STARK DK generates its revenue from each of our three
sales channels in generally equal proportion.

We continue to seek ways to enhance STARK DK’s product and service offering to grow and meet customer
demand. For instance, as part of our initiatives aimed at better sourcing and own brand product penetration, STARK DK
began sourcing Raw brand paint in January 2016 to further increase revenue from own brand paint. We have already
achieved significant savings under this initiative during the year ended October 31, 2017 and, as a result, we intend to
roll this out across our other business units. Moreover, we expect demand for our STARK DK products to continue
growing as urbanization trends, which typically increase the construction of residential buildings, in Denmark are
highest and are above market growth in major cities in which we have branches, such as Copenhagen, Aarhus and
Aalborg, according to a leading management consulting firm.

**_STARK FI_**

STARK FI is the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant and the only national non-franchise builders’
merchant chain in Finland. STARK FI benefits from a unique branch footprint and distribution set-up in the attractive
capital region of Helsinki with further presence in additional high growth areas, including all major Finnish cities.
STARK FI has a call center facility that operates 24 hours a day and seven days a week, allowing customers to place
their orders at any time. STARK FI’s distribution set-up also provides 24-hour weekday delivery service to customers in
the greater Helsinki area.

In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, STARK FI’s share of the revenue for the Ongoing Business was
€563 million, accounting for 26% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and STARK FI’s share of the gross profit,
excluding profit allocated to our headquarters, for the Ongoing Business was €98 million, accounting for 18% of total
gross profit for the Ongoing Business.

As of October 31, 2017, we directly operated 27 STARK FI branches, of which we owned the properties for 25
such branches, in attractive locations across Finland, including all major cities such as Helsinki, Turku, Oulu and
Tampere, as well as in strategic locations in rural areas. The following map shows our nationwide network of STARK FI
branches across Finland.

_Source: Company information_

While STARK FI serves five main types of customers, SMEs, private consumers, large construction companies
and other types of customers such as public authorities, its largest customer base comprises SMEs. Based on
management estimates, STARK FI is also the number one partner for national construction companies. Under our “Back
to Basics” strategy, we are in the process of implementing certain initiatives to increase sales efforts toward SMEs,
including sales leadership training for our salesforce, regular meetings to discuss our customer portfolio management
and our “Profit Hunt” initiative. Our “Profit Hunt” initiative, a strategy implementation program designed to emphasize
a data driven sales culture to increase B2B sales, generated increased revenue from SMEs in a pilot program at one of
our STARK FI branches and, as a result, we have rolled this out across seventeen other STARK FI branches with the
goal of replicating this across all of our STARK FI branches by 2019.

STARK FI offers products from each of our core product categories, but the timber and panels product category
generates the largest share of its revenue. As compared to our other business units, a larger proportion of STARK FI’s
revenue is generated through our direct delivery sales channel for large, heavy products. STARK FI has historically
operated with a different business model compared to that of our other business units, with a substantial share of
business being dedicated to direct delivery and wholesale operations namely to retailers and large construction
companies. Due to direct delivery and wholesale operations comprising a substantial portion of its business, STARK FI
has historically had lower margins compared to our other business units.

We continue to seek ways to enhance STARK FI’s product and service offering to grow and meet customer
demand. For instance, we have recently introduced a new product placement strategy in certain of our STARK FI
branches to offer fasteners next to our timber and panels offering to increase sales of complementary fasteners. We have
also recently introduced power tools accessories in all of our STARK FI branches, based on customer needs and
expectations. In addition, we expect demand for our STARK FI products to continue growing. This is primarily because
management believes STARK FI is the provider of choice for national construction companies and, according to a
leading management consulting firm, urbanization trends in Finland are highest and are above market growth in the
Helsinki region where we have well-established presence of several of our branches.

**_Beijer_**

Beijer is a leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in Sweden. Beijer benefits from strong customer loyalty and
high brand awareness among professional builders, particularly as a result of an established customer facing online sales
platform that comprises the strongest digital B2B building materials offering in Sweden.

In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, Beijer’s share of the revenue for the Ongoing Business was
€567 million, accounting for 26% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and Beijer’s share of the gross profit,
excluding profit allocated to our headquarters, for the Ongoing Business was €163 million, accounting for 31% of total
gross profit for the Ongoing Business.

As of October 31, 2017, we directly operated 66 Beijer branches, of which we owned the properties for 53 such
branches, in attractive locations across Sweden, including in the highest growth areas of all major cities such as
Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, as well as in strategic locations in rural areas. The following map shows our
nationwide network of Beijer branches across Sweden.

While Beijer serves four main types of customers, SMEs, large construction companies, private consumers and
other types of customers, its largest customer base comprises SMEs and large construction firms. We focus our
marketing strategies to enhance customer loyalty among SMEs, for which a new marketing campaign called “We Build
the Builders” was recently launched with positive feedback. As part of our “Back to Basics” strategy, we have also
initiated and, in certain cases, completed enhancements to our Beijer product portfolio to have greater focus on
underpenetrated segments which we believe are important to SMEs, such as façades, concrete, windows, doors and
roofing.

While Beijer offers products from each of our core product categories, the timber and panels product category,
followed closely by the heavy building materials product category, generate the two largest shares of its revenue. Beijer
typically generates the greatest proportion of its revenue from our stock collected sales channel.

We continue to seek ways to enhance Beijer’s product and service offering to grow and meet customer demand.
For instance, Beijer recently launched a sales program to refocus on particular customer-centric sales activities, create
internal competition among Beijer’s branches and improve marketing to increase customer awareness of Beijer’s
products. Beijer also utilizes a performance management process team that meets regularly to oversee its operations and

sales. In addition, Beijer’s customer contract management is being handled centrally, which will allow Beijer to
implement smart pricing terms consistently across customer contracts. Moreover, we expect demand for our Beijer
products to continue growing as urbanization trends in Sweden are highest and are above market growth in major cities
in which we have branches, such as Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, according to a leading management consulting
firm.

**_Neumann_**

Neumann is a leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in Bergen, Tromsø and southwestern Norway.
Management believes Neumann benefits from high customer loyalty when compared to competitors. Neumann also
benefits from a long history of serving professional builders dating back to 1839, when its predecessor, Rieber & Sønn,
was established.

In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, Neumann’s share of the revenue for the Ongoing Business was
€154 million, accounting for 7% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and Neumann’s share of the gross profit,
excluding profit allocated to our headquarters, for the Ongoing Business was €43 million, accounting for 8% of total
gross profit for the Ongoing Business.

As of October 31, 2017, we directly operated 14 Neumann branches, of which we owned the properties for nine
such branches, in attractive locations across Norway, covering high growth regions in northern and southwestern
Norway, including strong presence in Bergen, as well as in strategic locations in other regions of Norway such as Oslo
and Tromsø. The following map shows our nationwide network of Neumann branches across Norway.

While Neumann serves four main types of customers, SMEs, private consumers, large construction companies
and other types of customers, its largest customer base comprises SMEs. We focus our marketing strategies to enhance
customer loyalty among SMEs. As part of our “Back to Basics” strategy, we intend to introduce a new discount structure
tailored to each of Neumann’s customer groups, which will initially be based on preferences of our SME customers.

While Neumann offers products from each of our core product categories, the heavy building materials product
category generates the largest share of its revenue. As a result, with the aim of enabling Neumann to better serve SMEs,
we introduced a hub in Norway in 2017 focused on selling heavy building materials. Neumann typically generates the
greatest proportion of its revenue from our stock collected sales channel.

We continue to seek ways to enhance Neumann’s product and service offering to grow and meet customer
demand. For instance, Neumann utilizes a performance management process team that meets regularly to oversee its
operations and sales performance. In addition, we expect demand for our Neumann products to continue growing as
Neumann’s customer base includes national construction companies and, according to a leading management consulting
firm, urbanization trends in Norway are highest and are above market growth in major cities in which we have branches,
such as Bergen and Tromsø.

**Customers**

We have developed a large and highly diversified customer base and enjoy long-standing relationships with
many of our largest customers. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top 20 customers only generated
approximately 7% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 3% of gross profit for the Ongoing
Business.

Our customers comprise both B2B customers, our primary customer group, and B2C customers. Brief
descriptions of our different customer groups are set forth below:

     - _SMEs: SMEs are small- and medium-sized enterprises, which we typically define as companies with less_
than 50 employees. Due to information on the employee size of a company being non-public in certain of
our operating countries, we also define SMEs, in Finland, as local construction companies and, in Norway,
as local builders, entrepreneurs and masonry or bricklayer customers. We focus our business on SMEs,
which make up our core customer group and provide us with the most revenue. SMEs accounted for
approximately 56% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business in the year ended July 31, 2017.

     - _Private consumers: We define private consumers as individuals who purchase our products and services on_
a DIY basis. Private consumers are our second largest customer group by revenue. Private consumers
accounted for approximately 19% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business in the year ended July 31,
2017.

     - _Large construction companies: We define large construction companies as companies with more than 50_
employees, as well as customers with national accounts. Large construction companies are our third largest
customer group by revenue. Large construction companies accounted for approximately 14% of total
revenue for the Ongoing Business in the year ended July 31, 2017.

     - _Other customers: We define other customers as public, government and regulatory entities as well as retail_
companies. Other types of customers accounted for approximately 12% of total revenue for the Ongoing
Business in the year ended July 31, 2017.

We aim to retain and grow our customer base as we continue to monitor changes in customer and end-user
purchasing criteria and patterns to ensure we are well-placed to invest in and benefit from any changes underway,
including a shift in contemporary focus projects.

**Product Offering**

Each of our four business units offers a wide range of products to meet their respective target customers’
preferences and needs, while enabling distribution of and customer access to core building material product categories.
Our scale provides us with the ability to meet our customers’ product criteria and provide on-time sourcing and
guaranteed availability of key products. Each of our four business units carries each of our six core product categories as
set forth in the table below. The table below also sets forth the revenue, percentage of total revenue, gross profit and
percentage of gross profit generated by each key product category for the year ended July 31, 2017.

**_Product Assortment_**

We offer our customers a broad variety of leading branded products as well as an assortment of our own brand
products. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we derived approximately 91% of total revenue for the Ongoing
Business from branded products and approximately 9% from our own brand products.

114


-----

_Branded Products_

We stock branded products, including from premium suppliers such as Rockwool, Icopal, Metsä, UPM, DeWalt,
Bosch, and Black & Decker. With our logistics network across the Nordics, we aim to offer our suppliers a cost efficient
intraregional distribution platform, which includes less populated areas in which our suppliers may not have business
operations of their own, thereby differentiating us from our competitors.

_Own Brand Products_

The creation and management of our own brand products is a core element of our business strategy, and we
estimate that approximately 50% of our target customers are willing to buy half or more of their total basket in own
brand products. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by, or incurred costs in procuring, a
total number of 4,110 own brand SKUs. As part of our strategy, we aim to build a strategic common core range of 800
SKUs to be sold in each of our four business units and have already launched 173 SKUs for this common core range,
have 353 SKUs in our pipeline to be launched by the year ending July 31, 2018 and have the remaining 274 SKUs in our
pipeline to be launched by 2020.

Our own brand product portfolio contains four brands: Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics.

     - **_Raw: We aim to provide the best quality products for our customers through our premium brand, Raw. In_**
the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by, or incurred costs in procuring, a total
number of 2,251 SKUs under our Raw brand, mainly in the timber and panels, heavy building materials and
flooring and joinery product categories.

     - **_Raptor: We aim to provide good to high quality products for our customers through our mid-tier brand,_**
Raptor. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by, or incurred costs in
procuring, a total number of 710 SKUs under our Raptor brand, mainly in the tools and hardware and lightside product categories.

     - **_Domestic: We aim to provide good to high quality products for our customers through our mid-tier brand_**
for household products, Domestic. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by,
or incurred costs in procuring, a total number of 1,140 SKUs under our Domestic brand, mainly in the lightside and flooring and joinery product categories.

     - **_Basics: We aim to provide good quality, low price products for our customers through our value brand,_**
Basics. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by, or incurred costs in
procuring, a total number of nine SKUs under our Basics brand, mainly in the tools and hardware product
category.

We believe that our own brand products help to differentiate us from other builders’ merchants and general
building materials retailers, boost our ability to execute range innovation, control product lifecycles and reduce our
dependency on national manufacturer brands and, since they are sold exclusively through our fully company-owned
network, permit us to more effectively lead penetration of such products and attract and retain customers of such
products over time. In addition, our own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on average than branded SKUs,
according to management estimates.

**_Product and Range Review_**

We perform product and range reviews to determine the type and number of products necessary to stock at each
of our branches and collectively across all of our branches. Going forward, we intend to perform our product and range
reviews with the preferences of SMEs particularly in mind and to reflect contemporary trends among craftsmen within
SMEs as opposed to other customers.

Historically, each of our branches were required to have the same base assortment of SKUs but were free to
select the remaining assortment autonomously. Customers were only able to easily access the product assortment at their
local branch, which held approximately 8,000 to 14,000 SKUs out of a total of approximately 78,000 SKUs across all
branches. However, as approximately 20,000 SKUs under this model accounted for 93% of our revenue according to a
leading management consulting firm, we sought to create a more efficient sourcing strategy to produce higher working
capital and sourcing gains.

In recent years, we have invested resources to upgrade our inventory structure to concentrate on availability,
service, range and value for money which fit with our customers’ and end-users’ needs. For example, each of our

115


-----

branches in Denmark holds approximately 8,000 to 14,000 SKUs, localized to take into account specific customers’
preferences and needs. In addition, certain of our products, such as our full light-side assortment of approximately
11,500 SKUs, are available for weekday delivery within 24 hours to customers in Denmark. We are also preparing to
add an assortment of heavy-side SKUs to this offering, which we anticipate will allow us to make approximately 15,000
SKUs available for weekday delivery within 24 hours to such customers. In addition, we consider which SKUs have low
and high selling potential, respectively, based on various customer criteria related to the importance of quality and price
and we implement guaranteed availability either in branches or via delivery on our core product assortment subsets
based on such analyses to eliminate “out of stock” days. For instance, STARK DK in Denmark promises product
availability on a certain core range of approximately 1,000 SKUs, which if not available in-branch, will be delivered
within four hours and free of charge. The rationalization of our product assortment to reduce our assortment of SKUs
and allow for greater local variance and guaranteed availability of an in-demand core range of SKUs provides us with
opportunities for sourcing and working capital advantages.

**_Price Positioning_**

We aim to deliver a consistent customer experience that reinforces our brand promise and drives sales through
positive perceptions of quality, value and choice. We offer a broad range of branded and own brand building material
products at what we believe to be a competitive range of prices and through a variety of payment methods, including
cash, debit cards and credit cards. We also provide the majority of our customers with short-term credit for which we
carry the associated credit risk. We mitigate such credit risk by maintaining credit insurance, and we have historically
experienced minimal financial losses from these arrangements.

Over the past three years, we have been utilizing a smart pricing strategy, under which we have a dedicated
pricing team and smart pricing software. Our pricing strategy has been implemented in phases, which included setting
consistent shelf prices, discount structures based on customers’ size and buying profiles, a project pricing software tool
and a price guidance software tool. We also use vast market data publicly available to us to price our products at
competitive prices and have begun gathering all of our customers’ contracts centrally to better manage our customer
pricing terms on a consistent basis over time. Our discount structure facilitates increased sales for trade specific “high
runner” and known value products. We offer competitive prices for items purchased frequently and fairer prices for
times purchased infrequently, which we believe enhances brand and value perception among our customers to further
drive sales growth than in turn will drive movement in inventory.

The price increases on infrequently bought items generally offset the margin loss incurred in connection with the
price reductions we offer on trade-specific “high runner” products. In addition, the increased sales volumes enable us to
negotiate volume-driven discounts from our suppliers, which also have positive effects on our margins. These pricing
strategies have historically optimized our total sales and minimized the overall level of markdowns.

**_Customer Service_**

_General_

We complement our broad product offering with in-branch customer service and technical support, an after-sales
service and ongoing product support in relation to the products we sell. Our sales teams are well informed about our
products and are trained to use effective and customer-friendly techniques to expertly advise our customers and
maximize the probability of converting customer footfall into sales, as walk-in top-up sales remain important to our
business model.

As a fully company-owned chain, we have and take the opportunity to share best practices across our branches in
all aspects of client facing services, including sales, product knowledge and overall customer service. We use multiple
methods to monitor the quality of staff performance and customer service, including a management tool to calculate net
promoter scores (“NPS”) as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research. We measure and monitor NPS on
a daily basis, enabling us to monitor customer satisfaction at the branch level regularly and cater our customer services
accordingly. Branch, telephone, mail and internet ordering channels and the options for sales channels enable our
customers to access our products at their convenience. We believe that our service proposition contributes to a high
degree of customer satisfaction, attracts more people to our branches and other channels and generates customer loyalty,
repeat purchases and recommendations to friends and family.

_Digitalized Customer Services_

To maximize accessibility of our products across all of our markets, we also support our operations through a
variety of digitalized customer services under our online sales platforms, including online and mobile phone order,
product search and price comparison capabilities.

-----

We believe we have a competitive advantage over pure-play online retailers as they do not have the physical
presence and infrastructure required to compete with our immediate product availability and direct sales processes,
particularly for heavy building products and timber and panels, that generate and support our online sales to customers.
For example, heavy building materials and timber and panels represented 36% and 34%, respectively, of total revenue
for the Ongoing Business in the year ended July 31, 2017 and our logistics capabilities, including our physical
distribution platform and fleet of crane trucks, allows us to continue to deliver such products to customers quickly and
efficiently despite the complexity pure-play online retailers may face with respect to such deliveries. In addition,
customers value the possibility to negotiate prices on large orders and the loyalty discounts we offer, and while pureplay online retailers are capable of offering low list prices due to their savings on physical distribution networks, they are
not usually capable of negotiating prices on an individual basis which is a key consideration for B2B customers.
Furthermore, the possibility to extend credit terms represents a core attraction for trade customers, and pure-play online
retailers typically require immediate payment by debit or credit card, and the latter generally allows no more than forty
days of credit to the customer.

Sales through our online sales platforms generated less than 2% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business in the
twelve months ended October 31, 2017. Online sales for B2B builders’ merchants are generally still limited but we
expect this channel may grow, as our online sales platforms may increase efficiency for both our customers and our
business, offering our customers a potentially quicker and easier method for purchasing our products and also allowing
us the opportunity to configure payment and logistics more quickly.

**Marketing and Publicity**

As of October 31, 2017, we had a dedicated sales force of more than 850 employees, excluding branch sales staff
and office sales support staff. While we derive the majority of our revenue from long-term repeat customers and thus
implement strategies to enhance customer loyalty and retention, our marketing and sales strategies toward new
customers also play an important role in our operations. We pursue an active marketing and sales strategy to offer our
customers a one-stop shop with access to an wide assortment of SKUs across brands and manufacturers as well as
qualified expert advice on the products we sell based on deep product knowledge. We utilize targeted marketing for each
of our business units directed at key customer groups, including SMEs from which we generate the highest proportion of
our revenue. For example, we focus our marketing and sales strategies to enhance customer loyalty among SMEs,
including by organizing social events, such as golfing, fishing and racing, with such customers. In addition, through our
sales and marketing platform, we also increase our business prospects and margins by offering our suppliers a cost
efficient marketing partnership as well as market intelligence and strong and broad customer relations.

**Supply Chain**

**_Overview_**

In recent years, we have invested resources to upgrade our supply chain and enhance the quality of support to our
business in order to launch STARK Group Sourcing on August 1, 2017, the only single-company mandated sourcing
set-up harmonized across the Nordics within the construction materials distribution industry. STARK Group Sourcing is
designed to leverage benefits of scale to maximize sourcing synergies between each of our business units through a
three-step process of (i) rationalizing our suppliers, (ii) rationalizing our product assortment and common core range of
SKUs and (iii) improving payment terms with suppliers.

STARK Group Sourcing is operated by a team of 45 full-time equivalents (“FTEs”) supported by an advisory
board of seven managers across the four Nordic countries in which we operate. Our advisory board consists of our CEO,
business unit CEOs, Chief Procurement Officer and Business Development Director.

Leveraging its “one door” decision-making policy, STARK Group Sourcing focuses on strategic sourcing and
logistics through best practice and fact-based negotiations, as well as on increasing our own brand product penetration.
STARK Group Sourcing has been able to negotiate attractive payment terms with our suppliers, which we strive to
continuously improve with the aim of increasing our working capital.

In addition to STARK Group Sourcing, we also have dedicated assortment and category management teams in
each of our business units. The main responsibility of our assortment and category management teams is to determine
the range composition and product selection, product pricing and trading for their respective business unit.

Our supply chain consists of three main processes as set forth below: procurement and sourcing, logistics and
post-sale services.

117


-----

**_Procurement and Sourcing_**

As part of our strategy, we continue to focus on reducing our procurement and sourcing costs while maintaining
the level of quality and service we receive from our various suppliers. We have achieved certain efficiencies through a
rationalization of our supplier base as well as through the application of benchmarking, tendering and other competitive
techniques to award contracts.

As of October 31, 2017, we worked with more than 3,300 suppliers, which we have identified for rationalization
as part of our “Back to Basics” strategy. We spent approximately €2 billion in sourcing activities for the Ongoing
Business, before rebates, in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017. We aim to maintain good relationships with our
suppliers to ensure we benefit from product innovation, competitive prices and surety of supply. This results in valueadding services for our customers as we are able to procure our supplies with benefits of scale and final authority
provided by operating a company-owned network of branches, which enables us to more quickly secure and offer lower
pricing. Similarly, our suppliers are provided with value from our procurement and sourcing activities since they receive
high volume sales with a single counter-party and thus receive cost-efficient sales since we can purchase full pallets of
goods at scale and deliver partial pallets in specified quantities on an as needed basis to customers.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we spent approximately 43% of our sourcing spend for the
Ongoing Business on our operations for STARK DK in Denmark, approximately 26% of our sourcing spend for the
Ongoing Business on our operations for STARK FI in Finland, approximately 23% of our sourcing spend for the
Ongoing Business on our operations for Beijer in Sweden and approximately 7% of our sourcing spend for the Ongoing
Business on our operations for Neumann in Norway.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we spent approximately 91% of total sourcing spend for the
Ongoing Business on supplies for branded products and approximately 9% of total sourcing spend for the Ongoing
Business on supplies for our own brand products. We are aiming to expand our own brand offering to increase sourcing
spend on these products to support gross margin development for our product offering.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we spent approximately 37% of our sourcing spend for the
Ongoing Business on heavy building materials, 26% on timber and panels, 16% on flooring and joinery, 13% on tools
and hardware, 6% on light-side and 2% on other products.

**_Logistics_**

Our logistics processes consists of both inbound and outbound logistics operations.

_Inbound Logistics_

Our inbound logistics operations involves the storage of our products. Regional stocking of our products allows
for market leading availability for our customers. In addition, strategically located hubs benefit our suppliers without
requiring them to introduce capital commitment to store and ship their supplies. We typically receive payment for our
inbound logistics costs from our suppliers.

As of October 31, 2017, our inbound logistics platform consisted of five ship hubs and one light-side hub,
totaling more than one million square meters of warehousing, to serve our network of branches in the Nordics. We also
utilize certain of our branches to stock and distribute our products. Two of our ship hubs are located in Denmark, two
additional ship hubs are located in Finland and the remaining ship hub is located in Sweden. Our light-side hub is
located in Denmark and is used for distribution of products purchased online and of slow moving items.

_Sales Channels_

Our sales channels involve the collection, distribution and delivery of our products. We aim to offer our suppliers
a cost efficient distribution platform, which includes less populated areas in which our suppliers may not have business
operations of their own. We aim to offer our customers flexibility with respect to their desired delivery type and timing
as well, including cost efficient deliveries on a consistent basis and convenient proximity of product collection points.
We typically receive payment for our sales channel costs from our customers or such costs are embedded in our product
prices.

We offer the following sales channels:

     - **_Stock collected: Stock collected relates to goods available as stock and purchased or collected by customers_**
inside our branches. Such goods are often reflective of smaller orders and one-off purchases by smaller
construction companies and private consumers. Stock collected typically generate gross margins between

118


-----

25% and 29% as this sales channel involves a higher margin product mix, including tools and hardware, and
value-added potential from large product assortment and availability within branches, as well as higher
exposure to higher margin RMI activities.

     - **_Direct delivery: Direct delivery relates to goods that are delivered directly from the manufacturer to the_**
customer and therefore not recorded in our stock. We act as distributors for such goods and do not incur
delivery costs relating to such goods, resulting in the lowest cost-to-serve of these three sales channels. Such
goods are often reflective of large construction needs of national as well as regional and local B2B
customers. Direct delivery typically generates gross margins between 5% and 15%, as large order volumes
can lead to discounts and lower purchasing power with manufacturers and as this channel typically has
higher exposure to lower margin new build activities.

     - **_Stock delivered: Stock delivered relates to goods purchased by customers and held as stock in our branches_**
or distribution centers prior to being delivered to customers, with delivery of certain products completed
within 24 hours during weekdays in Denmark from the time of purchase. Such goods are often reflective of
orders by national, regional and local B2B customers. Stock delivered typically generate variable gross
margins depending on the country of operation and type of customer contract, including as a result of mixed
exposure to RMI and new build activities.

As of October 31, 2017, our sales channels involved 179 branches, including six branches in Greenland, across
the four Nordic countries in which we operate as well as five central distribution centers located in Brønerslev,
Tommerop, Aarhus, Stockholm and Helsinki. As of October 31, 2017, our sales channels involved approximately 120
delivery trucks that we directly operate and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks across the Nordics that we hire
depending on our needs.

**_Post-Sale Services_**

Our post-sales services include credit accounts, payment handling, warranties and technical support. We aim to
offer our customers flexible payment terms, such as short-term credit, and convenient post-sales customer services. We
aim to offer our suppliers outsourcing of their payment handling schemes, customer credit assessments, front line credit
handling and end-user product feedback.

**_Suppliers_**

We believe that the diversity of our supplier base reduces our exposure to changes related to any single supplier.
In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top ten suppliers, excluding unmapped suppliers, accounted for
approximately 28% of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business, with no one supplier accounting for 10% or
more of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business.

As of October 31, 2017, we worked with more than 3,300 suppliers, at least approximately 42% of which were
located in Denmark, at least approximately 7% of which were located in Finland, at least approximately 16% of which
were located in Sweden, at least approximately 13% of which were located in Norway, at least approximately 3% of
which were located in the rest of Europe and at least approximately 0.1% of which were located in the rest of the world,
with the remaining 18.9% currently unclear due to data procurement issues.

We conduct business with our suppliers under Nordic or local cooperation agreements, Nordic or local own
brand agreements and trade agreements depending on whether we are sourcing branded products or own brand products.
In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, approximately 36% of our sourcing spend was incurred under Nordic
agreements, approximately 47% of our sourcing spend was incurred under local agreements and approximately 0.1% of
our sourcing spend was incurred under trade agreements. Approximately 17% of our sourcing spend was incurred
without a framework agreement in place.

_Agreements with Suppliers for Branded Products_

For the sourcing of branded products, we use a central contract management system that produces a standardized
supplier contract in English or the local language. The applicable law for such contract is the law of the lead business
unit entering into the contract. The template supplier agreement consists of (i) commercial terms, (ii) legal terms and
(iii) a supplier manual. The ability to include non-standardized terms is limited and requires prior approval from, in the
case of commercial terms, the relevant sourcing director for the business unit in question and in the case of legal terms,
various Group legal teams. Typical terms of these contracts include terms governing termination, the assignment of
contractual rights, payment, rebates and indemnities and delivery dates, some of which allow for different options to be
agreed by the supplier and the business unit party thereto. Certain of our supplier contracts include a tiered pricing
scheme, which we negotiate to garner higher discounts on larger volumes of product purchases.

119


-----

The supplier manual sets out certain administration, delivery and packaging instructions applicable to all of our
suppliers. We aim to purchase materials from suppliers that develop and produce products that have high brand
recognition for our branded products, are of high quality and use leading technology. We require that all our suppliers
agree to satisfy minimum requirements under our code of conduct, including with respect to quality assurance standards,
and we work with them to ensure that they understand the importance of our code of conduct. We manage our
relationships with suppliers across our business through regular meetings, senior management engagement and strategic
follow-ups.

Our finance team checks all supplier agreements before approving them for payment through our finance system,
and reports any contracts with unauthorized, non-standardized terms to our legal team for review.

_Agreements with Suppliers for Own Brand Products_

For the sourcing of own brand products, we use the same central contract management system to produce a
similarly standardized supplier contract but with an additional schedule of terms providing information and
specifications concerning our own brand products.

_Agreements with Suppliers in China_

For the sourcing of products from China, STARK Group Sourcing enters into direct or wholesale agreements
with suppliers in China that are standardized but different from our standard contracts used outside of Asia. Agreements
with suppliers in China reflect local requirements and cultural norms. In connection with our separation from Ferguson
as part of the Acquisition, we no longer source from China through an affiliate of Ferguson. When sourcing from China,
our business units liaise with a dedicated department that places orders from the business units under framework
agreements with the local Chinese suppliers, advises on compliance with import and export requirements and facilitates
arrangements with freight forwarders. Such agreements are then transferred to our central contract management system
for centralized maintenance.

**Information Technology**

We have historically had a fully in-house IT operation setup, but will be moving towards greater reliance on
external strategic IT partners. While under the Ferguson Group, our operations were managed by Ferguson’s shared
technology service provider, which provided, among other things, shared data centers, software applications, security
services, maintenance services and engineering solutions. In connection with the Acquisition, and during an agreed
transition period, we plan to outsource most of our IT services, including, for example, hosting, support functions and
application management services.

**Real Properties**

Part of our strategy is to manage our freehold property portfolio to provide the best operating locations for each
of our business units while building brand value and maximizing returns from each site. The key differentiating factor
when compared to our competitors is that all of our 179 branches are fully company-owned, meaning we directly operate
all 179 branches. For instance, XL Byg, K-Rauta, Woody and Kesko, some of our main competitors in our four core
markets of Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway, respectively, operate under a franchise or procurement cooperative
business model. Full control over our branch and distribution network provides us with an efficient set-up of our
operations on a Group-wide basis and enables us to meet increased customer requirements for flexible collection and
delivery services on both a national and cross-regional basis, as applicable.

As of September 30, 2017, we had a freehold real estate portfolio that was independently valued at up to
€805 million. Since the real estate market is affected by many factors, including but not limited to, general economic
conditions, interest rates, inflation rates, urbanization rates, household disposable income levels and supply and demand
dynamics, many of which are beyond our control, the valuation of our real estate portfolio may not be accurate. In
addition, the value of our real properties may depreciate. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our
_Industry—The valuation of our freehold real estate portfolio may not be accurate or may decrease significantly and our_
_obligations under our leasehold real estate portfolio may be restrictive.”_

As of September 30, 2017, we had a strategically located freehold property portfolio with a total of 195
properties with an average gross leasable area of 5,820 square meters. The following table provides an overview of our
property portfolio by business unit as of September 30, 2017.

(1) The valuations have been prepared by an independent evaluator on a property by property basis, without taking into account a property portfolio
premium. Such independent evaluator expects that the investment market will offer a premium on the total property portfolio that equals an
average yield of 6.5%, which would provide a total property portfolio value up to €805 million.

**Intellectual Property**

As of October 31, 2017, we had approximately 120 registered trademarks for our business units as well as our
own brand products, excluding certain trademarks that will not be included as part of the Acquisition. Business unit
trademarks are registered in the relevant country and, where possible, across the entire Nordic area. Own brand product
trademarks are registered, where possible, in both word and logo format in all Nordic countries and certain relevant low
cost sourcing countries where local registration is a requirement for exporting goods.

As of October 31, 2017, we had approximately 160 registered website domain names with the appropriate
authorities in the Nordics and abroad, excluding certain website domain names that will not be included as part of the
Acquisition.

We rely on intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, trade names, copyrights, design rights and domain names. We regard our
trademarks and other intellectual property rights as valuable assets in the marketing of our products and take appropriate
action when necessary to protect them.

**Employees**

As of October 31, 2017, our workforce consisted of 5,056 FTEs and a total headcount of 5,667 personnel as set
forth in the below chart.

Collective labor agreements are in place for the vast majority of our employees in Denmark, Finland, Sweden
and Norway, and where they are not in place, tend to be followed in practice. We believe our relations with our
employees are good. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to reach satisfactory agreements with our
employees in the future, or that these agreements will be concluded without work stoppages or strikes.

**Insurance**

While under the Ferguson Group, we maintained insurance coverage under a Group insurance plan to cover risks
associated with the ordinary operation of our business, including general liability, property and business interruption,
and product liability insurance. In connection with the Acquisition, we will procure new insurance coverage from the

121


-----

Acquisition Completion Date, to insure our branches, hubs, distribution centers and other properties against such hazards
as fire, explosion, theft, flood, mischief and accidents. In addition, we will continue to maintain certain local insurances
in place to satisfy local business or regulatory requirements. All of our policies have historically been and will continue
to be underwritten with well-established insurance providers, and we have historically and will continue to conduct
periodic reviews of our insurance coverage, both in terms of coverage limits and deductibles. We believe that our
insurance coverage will continue to be sufficient for the risks associated with our operations. No new material claims
have been made under our insurance policies within the last twelve months and there have been no recent material
changes to our insurance premiums.

**Health and Safety**

We give high priority to the continued health and safety of all of our employees and customers. We aim to
eliminate all health and safety related incidents that may occur as a result of our activities or our products whether they
occur in our branches, at our customers’ premises or in our hubs and distribution centers and during our delivery
processes. We have a health and safety department that sets standards for health and safety throughout our business units
and regularly monitors progress made towards achieving such standards. We conduct health and safety audits two times
per year on average in each of our branches.

**Environmental Matters**

We are subject to numerous supranational, national and local environmental laws and regulations, including in
connection with the operation of our branches, hubs and distribution centers. We could incur significant costs, including
fines, penalties and other sanctions, third-party claims and environmental cleanup costs, as a result of violations of or
liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or operational permits and licenses required thereunder. In
connection with the Acquisition, a vendor due diligence environmental survey was conducted on all of our sites. We
believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental, laws and
regulations. These environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, however, as are the priorities of those
who enforce them, and we could incur additional costs complying with future laws and regulations. Although
environmental matters have not had a material impact on our business to date, we cannot assure you that environmental
conditions identified and/or environmental obligations imposed on us in the future relating to any of our prior, existing
or future properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or
cash flow.

**Regulatory Matters**

We are subject to governmental regulation from national and international regulatory authorities concerning,
among other things, export and import quotas and other customs regulations; consumer and data protection; the
advertisement, promotion and sale of merchandise; product safety; timber sourcing; the health, safety and working
conditions of our employees; the safety of our branches and their accessibility for the disabled; and our competitive and
marketplace conduct. As our business increases its exposure to own brand products, our exposure to product related
compliance requirements will increase as primary legal responsibility in connection with such products will rest with us.
In addition, all businesses that process data in the European Union are working towards compliance with the General
Data Protection Regulation. We have a plan to achieve compliance that is in line with market practice in this area.
Subject to the foregoing, we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations. We cannot
assure you, however, that any future changes in the requirements or mode of enforcement of these laws and regulations
will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**Legal Proceedings**

We become involved, from time to time, in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our
business, such as employee and customer claims, disputes with suppliers and intellectual property disputes. We are not
currently party to any material administrative, legal or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant
effect on our financial position or profitability, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or
threatened. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer
no assurances in this regard.

**Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers**

**_General_**

The total remuneration of our directors and other key management personnel for the year ended July 31, 2017
was €1 million. The remuneration of our directors and senior management team is evaluated through individual
performances and market trends.

**_Management Participation Program_**

Following the Acquisition Completion Date, Lone Star Fund X plans to implement management participation
plans pursuant to which certain directors, officers and managers of the Group, will be permitted to indirectly invest up to
approximately €6 million in ordinary shares and preferred equity certificates issued by Lux TopCo S.à r.l. (“Lux
Topco”), an indirect parent company of the Issuer. It is currently anticipated that all eligible directors, officers and
managers of the Group will invest in a management pooling vehicle to be established pursuant to Luxembourg law,
which in turn will acquire the relevant ordinary shares and preferred equity certificates issued by Lux Topco. We
currently expect the terms of our future management participation plans to be included in an investment agreement
providing, inter alios, for customary put and call option provisions, and tag-along and drag-along rights attached to the
ordinary shares and preferred equity certificates.

-----

**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS**

Following the Transactions, Lone Star Fund X will indirectly, through wholly-owned or majority-owned
subsidiaries, own 100% of the share capital of Lux Holdco. Lux Holdco, the direct parent of the Issuer, holds 100% of
the limited shares of the Issuer and Lux GP, the Issuer’s general partner, holds the only unlimited share in the Issuer. As
a result, Lone Star Fund X will indirectly own all the share capital of the Target (excluding shares held by management
pursuant to the proposed management participation program). See also “Management—Compensation of Directors and
_Executive Officers—Management Participation Program.”_

**The Sponsor**

Following the completion of the Acquisition, Lone Star Fund X will be the indirect principal shareholder of the
Group. Lone Star Fund X is the most recently established opportunity fund organized by the principals of Lone Star.
Lone Star Funds (“Lone Star”) is a leading private equity firm that invests globally in real estate, equity, credit and other
financial assets with affiliate offices in North America, Western Europe and Asia. Since the establishment of its first
fund in 1995, Lone Star has closed approximately 480 investments in over 1,400 transactions at an aggregate purchase
price of approximately $190 billion (including acquisition financing and co-investors), such as investments in Xella,
Esmalglass, the Balta Group, Forterra and Continental Building Products.

**Shareholder Funding**

The Acquisition is expected to require €1,100 million of debt and equity financing (including transaction fees
and expenses and cash funded to the Target’s balance sheet for general corporate purposes). The Acquisition will be
financed through (i) the issuance of the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of €515 million and (ii) €585 million of
Shareholder Funding to be indirectly provided by Lone Star Fund X via its direct and indirect subsidiaries to Bidco. We
expect the Shareholder Funding to consist of an equity contribution and deeply subordinated shareholder debt. Any
shareholder debt to be provided to the Issuer by Lux Holdco and on-lent to Bidco will be subordinated to all other
present and future obligations of the Issuer and Bidco (other than the Issuer’s or Bidco’s common equity) and will not be
guaranteed or secured. Additionally, such shareholder debt will not contain any covenants or events of default, and will
mature at least six months after the final maturity date of the Notes.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Ordinary Course of Business Relationships with Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we regularly enter into agreements with or render services to
related parties. In turn, such related parties may render services or deliver goods to us as part of their business. For
example, in the ordinary course of business, we regularly enter into intercompany loan and receivables, purchase and
supply agreements between subsidiaries and affiliated companies and with associated companies or shareholders of such
associated companies, including non-controlling interests that are not part of our Group. Additionally, prior to the
completion of the Acquisition, we are subject to a tax sharing agreement with Ferguson, and Ferguson is currently
providing certain central support services to us.

We believe that all transactions of the Group with affiliated companies and persons are negotiated and conducted
on a basis equivalent to those that would have been achievable on an arm’s-length basis, and that the terms of these
transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service
providers.

**Transaction and Consulting Services Agreements**

Following the Acquisition Completion Date, we may enter into transaction and consulting services agreements
with Lone Star Fund X or one or more of its affiliates pursuant to which we would make certain payments to Lone Star
Fund X or one or more of its affiliates for management, consulting or advisory services and related expenses.

**Management Participation Program**

Following the Acquisition Completion Date, Lone Star Fund X plans to implement a management participation
program for certain directors, officers and managers of the Group, including branch managers. See “Management—
_Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers—Management Participation Program.”_

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

The following is a summary of certain provisions of our indebtedness and certain financial arrangements to
which we and certain of our subsidiaries are or will be a party. It does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and
qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents.

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Transaction, the Issuer will enter into a super senior revolving credit facility agreement
with, among others, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as agent, Credit Suisse International, Danske Bank A/S, DNB
Bank ASA and Nykredit Bank A/S as mandated lead arrangers (the “Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement”). The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for a super senior revolving credit facility
in a principal amount of €100 million (the “Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility” for the purposes of this description).

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the Issuer, Bidco and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries which accede to the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional borrowers (the
“SSRCF Borrowers”) including those incorporated in Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Norway or Sweden and may be
applied in or towards (directly or indirectly) (A) financing or refinancing the general corporate purposes and/or working
capital requirements of the Group (including, without limitation, the financing or refinancing of capital expenditure, any
permitted acquisitions, acquisition costs, investments and joint ventures, operational restructurings and reorganization
requirements of the Group, financing or refinancing financial indebtedness of the Group or any acquisition target (plus,
in each case, any related breakage costs, redemption premia and make-whole costs) any ticking fees required to be paid
in connection with, and any interest on, the secured debt documents or any additional OID or other fees and any related
fees, costs and expenses) and (B) financing any other payments identified in the tax structure memorandum arising in
connection with the Acquisition and/or the refinancing of any existing indebtedness of the Target and certain of its
subsidiaries, in each case, together with related fees, costs and expenses.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be available in euro, sterling, U.S. dollars, Swedish krona,
Danish krone, Norwegian krone and (with the consent of the relevant lenders) certain other currencies readily available
in the relevant interbank market and can be made available by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of letters of credit
and by way of ancillary facilities (on both a bilateral and fronted basis).

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes (in addition to other permissions under the
limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against the limitation on indebtedness
covenant) to incur additional indebtedness (through the establishment of one or more additional facilities within the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), up to an aggregate amount of the greater of €115 million and 106%
of LTM EBITDA (as defined in “Description of the Notes”).

**_Availability_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) the date on which the
Acquisition completed in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition Closing Date”) to
(and including) the date which is one month prior to the maturity date of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR or, for loans denominated in Swedish krona, STIBOR or, for loans denominated in Danish krone, CIBOR or,
for loans denominated in Norwegian krone, NIBOR or, for loans denominated other than in euro, Swedish krona, Danish
krone or Norwegian krone, LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, which in each case will be subject to a decreasing margin
ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as further
described in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (the “Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility. If LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made
under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. If STIBOR is less than zero, STIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in

128


-----

respect of loans made under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. If CIBOR is less than zero, CIBOR shall be
deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. If NIBOR is less than
zero, NIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility from the Acquisition Closing Date to the end of the availability period applicable to the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility, at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility. Commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears, on the last date of the availability period applicable to the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and on the date the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date falling sixty six (66) months from the Acquisition Closing Date.
Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed,
subject to certain conditions.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to de minimis
amounts). The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory
prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon a “Change of Control.”

A “Change of Control” for the purposes of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility shall be defined as per the
Notes, save that no portability feature shall apply for the purposes of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by each Guarantor on a joint and several basis.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the same security interests as for the Notes as set
forth under “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security principles that apply to the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Issuer is required to ensure that members of the Group that generate at least 80% of
(A) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”) and (B) gross assets of the
Group are guarantors of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (i) on the date which is 120 days
following the Acquisition Closing Date; and (ii) thereafter on the date when the annual financial statements of the Issuer
are required to be delivered to the agent in connection with the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to certain
limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters set
forth in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and, to the extent such requirement is not satisfied on
such date, the Issuer shall ensure that it is so satisfied within 120 days of such date).

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject
to certain agreed qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including: (i) status; (ii) binding
obligations; (iii) non-conflict with other obligations; (iv) power and authority; (v) validity and admissibility in evidence;
(vi) governing law and enforcement; (vii) pari passu ranking; (viii) filing and stamp taxes; (ix) base case model and
reports; (x) laws applicable to operations; (xi) environmental laws; (xii) no liens/guarantees/indebtedness; (xiii) group
structure; (xiv) holding company status; (xv) pension schemes; (xvi) insolvency; (xvii) no litigation; (xviii) taxation;
(xix) no default; (xx) financial statements; (xxi) legal ownership; (xxii) intellectual property; (xxiii) center of main
interests; (xxiv) acquisition documents; (xxv) compliance with anti-corruption laws and sanctions and (xxvi) validity and
effectiveness of transaction security.

Certain representations and warranties will be made on the Acquisition Closing Date (as defined in the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and certain representations and warranties will be repeated on the date of
each utilization, on the first day of each interest period (other than in the case of roll over cash drawings) and at certain
other times.

129


-----

**_Covenants_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments and exceptions) that are set forth in the Indenture.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a “note purchase condition” covenant.
Subject to certain exceptions set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer may not, and shall procure
that no restricted subsidiary will, prepay, purchase, defease or redeem (or otherwise retire for value) any of the Notes
prior to their scheduled repayment date. The exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) payments that do
not exceed 50% of the aggregate original principal face value amount of the Notes as at the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions and grace
periods, including covenants relating to: (i) authorizations and consents; (ii) compliance with laws; (iii) center of main
interests; (iv) provision of guarantees and security; (v) further assurance; (vi) compliance with anti-corruption laws and
sanctions; and (vii) provision of financial information (as per the Notes) and compliance certificates.

In addition, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes a financial covenant requiring the
drawn super senior leverage ratio not to exceed a flat ratio set with 40 per cent headroom versus the base case model for
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (which shall be calculated by reducing consolidated EBITDA as set out in
that base case model (the “Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio”)). The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is calculated
as the ratio of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding loans under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
less the aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalent investments and temporary cash investments held by members of the
Group (“Drawn Super Senior Facilities Debt”) to consolidated pro forma EBITDA for the twelve month period
preceding the relevant quarterly testing date and is tested quarterly on a rolling basis, subject to the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility being (excluding any utilizations by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees), ancillary
facilities any amounts utilized to fund any original issue discount and any other flex related payments, fees, costs and
expenses) greater than 35% drawn on the relevant test date (the “Test Condition”).

The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent
definitions described in this offering memorandum.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the
shareholders of the Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to the Issuer to (i) increase the
consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or (ii) decrease Drawn
Super Senior Facilities Debt. The equity cure right may not be exercised on more than four occasions during the term of
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and may not be utilized in consecutive quarters. Such shareholder injections
may also be used to prepay loans under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility so that the Test Condition is no
longer satisfied.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will fall-away upon the Notes achieving Investment Grade Status (as defined in “Description of the Notes”).

**_Events of Default_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as
under the Notes. In addition, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for additional events of
default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) breach of the financial covenant
described above (subject to the equity cure rights described above); (ii) inaccuracy of a representation or statement when
made; (iii) repudiation and rescission of the financing documents, (iv) invalidity and unlawfulness of the financing
documents; and (v) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English law
although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions scheduled to the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without
prejudice to the fact that the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer, certain
Guarantors and the Trustee will enter into an Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the agent, arrangers and
lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the relationship
of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt and other obligations of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider, when payments can be made in respect of debt or other obligations of the Debtors or Third Party Security
Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt
and other obligations will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and
provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does
not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and not the
discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of the Trustee. Capitalized terms used but
not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the purposes of this description:

“ICA Group” shall mean the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

References to the “Senior Secured Notes” shall include the Notes and any other notes, securities or other debt
instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made available to or by a
member of the ICA Group which are designated by the Issuer as Senior Secured Notes under the Intercreditor
Agreement and references to the “Topco Notes” shall include any notes, securities or other debt instruments issued or to
be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made available to or by a Topco Borrower which are
designated by the Issuer as Topco Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement uses the term “the Company” to refer to the Issuer and “Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities” to refer to the Notes and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Debts_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Issuer and each other debtor (under the
Intercreditor Agreement (together, the “Debtors”) (other than any member of the ICA Group which is designated as a
Topco Borrower under the Intercreditor Agreement (a “Topco Borrower”))) shall rank in right of priority and payment in
the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

(i) first, liabilities owed to (i) the lenders, issuing banks and ancillary lenders in relation to any senior
secured facilities agreements (a “Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement”) (the “Senior Lender
Liabilities”), (ii) the lenders, issuing banks, and ancillary lenders in relation to the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement or any future super senior facilities agreement (a “Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement”) and any hedge counterparty under a hedging agreement that is designated by the
Issuer as super senior (together the “Super Senior Liabilities” and creditors thereof being the “Super
Senior Creditors”), (iii) the Trustee and any trustee in relation to future senior secured notes (each a
“Senior Secured Notes Trustee”) (other than certain amounts paid to it in its capacity as trustee), the
holders of the Notes or future senior secured notes (the “Senior Secured Notes”) and the Security Agent
in relation to the Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities”), (iv) the lender under any

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities or Pension Priority
Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification by the Issuer that such New Debt
Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement under the
relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt Financing, each agent in respect
of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other person party to a Transaction Security
document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized and instructed to enter promptly into
any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) subject to certain conditions,
including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer or otherwise
required by the Issuer to the extent that the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is
not being amended or released and the new Transaction Security or new Topco Independent Transaction Security only
secures the New Debt Financing, substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries who, after the
Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a Restricted
Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date
(together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of
such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt
Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including subject to
any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is no requirement to offer that security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in
respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would
breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under the
Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), (ii) over any asset required
(including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other
than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented
by the documentation in relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including
any payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of
such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities,
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility Liabilities (together with the
Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,” the creditors in respect thereof being the “Senior Secured
Creditors”) at any time, provided that following certain acceleration events under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement or any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Notes Indenture or Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a member of the ICA Group,
payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers and received by creditors in accordance with
the provisions described below under “—Application of Proceeds” provided that there shall be no obligation to turnover
any such payments received, other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal
(as defined below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the ICA shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of default under such applicable
Senior Secured Finance Documents.

135


-----

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured

Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”), the Debtors
may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance
documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest) is not
prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so
prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to the
agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the
case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility document or Senior
Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding
that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and basket amounts
are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of the next paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second Lien
Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority Discharge Date”), the Issuer,
Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other members of the ICA Group may only make specified
scheduled payments (including any other direct or indirect step, matter, action or dealing in relation to any Topco
Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement) under the Topco Liabilities or under any Topco
Proceeds Loan (together the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco Creditors or any holding company of the Issuer or
other lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (such
payments, collectively, “Permitted Topco Payments”):

interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management

under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit

capitalized interest (such other amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including, if
applicable, special interest (or liquidated damages))) and default interest on the Topco Liabilities
accrued and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance
Document (as at the date of the issue of the same or as amended in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a
result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of
currency indemnities in any Topco Finance Document, (3) made in pursuance of a debt buy-back
program approved by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and
Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts due under any
syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other than
in respect of paragraph (M) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment
Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower under any
prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (K) below) irrespective of

136


-----

whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the payment is not
prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without double counting any
equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt
Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents,
(B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations
(including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring advisors) and a

amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as defined below), (D) of costs necessary to protect, preserve or enforce
security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums, amendment fees (including any original issue
discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably
incidental to) the Topco Finance Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements
under the Topco Finance Documents), (F) of any other amount not exceeding €2,500,000 in any twelve
month period, (G) of any amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the
issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice
is outstanding) which has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or
where that amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco
Liabilities during such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such
payment may be made if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or
Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of
default under the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is
continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in
consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the Issuer (a “Debt for Equity Swap”)
provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does
not result in a Change of Control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance
Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of the ICA Group to another member of the ICA
Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Issuer that arise as a result
of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien
Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien
Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities or
Subordinated Liabilities owed by any member of the ICA Group, (I) of non-cash interest made by way of
capitalizing interest or issuing a non cash-pay instrument which is subordinated on the same terms as the
Topco Liabilities, (J) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Topco Liabilities
incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (K) if the payment is made by the Topco
Borrower in respect of its obligations under the Topco Finance Documents; and such payment is not
directly or indirectly sourced from a member of the ICA Group or such payment is funded from proceeds
received by the Topco Borrower from the ICA Group without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents
unless the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower of any prior ranking debt facilities at such time and
any such prior ranking debt facility has been accelerated or an Insolvency Event has occurred; (L) if the
payment is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a
Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or in relation to the prepayment of a
single lender in the event of a tax gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable and
(M) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing the payment is a payment of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final
maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that
contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or
borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior
consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security Providers
may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance Documents and the
Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the
occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event
of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the

137


-----

instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the
instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco
Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the
Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the ICA
Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has been
remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors gave the
instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the
Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of
Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event of default. No
more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, or
(ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default shall not
prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the
relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the
finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco
Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco (each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) payment block provisions
will release any Debtor from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to
accrue) under the applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The
accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue
notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco
Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

138


-----

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions (including, but not limited to, a provision that provides that any Intra-Group Lender
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in respect of Intra-Group Liabilities who is under a competing contractual
requirement to turnover those proceeds to any trade creditor of the Topco Group (and that competing obligations is not
prohibited by a Finance Document) is not required to turn over the applicable proceeds), the Intercreditor Agreement
will provide that if, at any time prior to the latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured
Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully
discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured
Creditor) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the ICA Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below
under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or
proceedings against a Debtor, member of the ICA Group or any Third Party Security Provider
(other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities

result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member of the ICA
Group or Third Party Security Provider, that creditor will:

(A) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or making of an
order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization, (b) a composition,
compromise, assignment or arrangement with any class of creditors generally (other than any Secured Party), (c) a
moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative
receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (e) any
analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings,
proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted
under any Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted
Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the case of
a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person
responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured
Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the
provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the ICA Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to creditors are,
with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a Senior Secured
Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it
which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
“—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of
any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization
proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and
receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event in relation to an Obligor, member of the ICA Group or Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all
things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the Transaction
Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an Instructing Group,
Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as specified in the provisions
described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior Secured
Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the Senior Secured
Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”), and Super
Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Super
Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured
Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime described under
“—Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but before
the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of the Second Lien
Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

140


-----

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in
accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions
they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other
agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the
Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge Date has
not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super
Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by
enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the
Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination
as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super
Senior Creditors deliver instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior
to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the
Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to
make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Agent”)
(acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to
enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable)
have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or
(B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under the
Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such instruction or indicate
any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to
the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the paragraph above may give
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on
such instructions.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ICA or any other Debt Document, the creditors in respect of the
Pension Priority Liabilities (and their representatives) shall have no right (in that capacity) to give any instructions
relating to the enforcement of any Transaction Security or refraining from enforcing any Transaction Security, including
in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of
that Transaction Security, provided that prior to taking any enforcement action as described herein, the Security Agent
shall, to the extent practicable, consult with the relevant creditors in respect of the Pension Priority Liabilities.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that (i) to the
extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen should
maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and (iii) enforcement
in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales
process, shall (if the Security Agent is requested to do so by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior
Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial
adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors) may
give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Topco Independent
Transaction Security as they see fit.

141


-----

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with any
of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under the above
provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include
taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the security
documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in
accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien Creditors,
with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group, (i) no

Finance Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

“Enforcement Action” is defined as:

commencing proceedings in relation to such liabilities;

(ii) premature termination or close-out of a hedging agreement, save to the extent permitted by the

Group provided that the ownership interest of the member of the ICA Group is not diluted and any
relevant shares remain subject to the same Transaction Security as existed prior to the issue, (F) any
action or step taken by a creditor in respect of Pension Priority Liabilities or any other person pursuant to
or in connection with the Pension Priority Liabilities or the documents governing the Pension Priority
Liabilities (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any action or step by the Security Agent in respect of

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in
respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security securing the Topco
Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
“Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee
or the Topco Borrower in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes Trustee,
Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice notifying any agent under a
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), senior secured notes trustee, the Second Lien
Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a Topco
Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the “Topco Standstill Period”);

143


-----

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a Topco
Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the
Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other member of the
ICA Group or Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve or
protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against
whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Topco

remedy).

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation to a
Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Topco
Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may elect to purchase the Senior
Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility
Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been
required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also
elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to
specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been
terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and is
irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction from any
creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Issuer:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Issuer has
confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release
and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a
disposal to a member of the ICA Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any
member of the ICA Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement security;

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents pursuant to which that
asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the ICA Group,

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
“Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the ICA Group to the extent that the Issuer has
confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect any amendment or
waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligation or take any action in relation
to such document or agreement;

144


-----

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the
ICA Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor to the extent that the Issuer
has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the terms of each
Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent
that the Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release in
accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined
in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement); and

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interest in a Debtor, the GP other member of the ICA
Group or any holding company of any Debtor or the GP or any other transaction pursuant to which a
Debtor, the GP other member of the ICA Group or any holding company of any Debtor or the GP will
cease to be a member of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor the
GP or other member of the ICA Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the
Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents
(including any claim relating to a Debt Document).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A) or (i)(B) above, the Issuer shall confirm in
writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the date of completion of
such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal or similar
transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall confirm in
writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or cessation is
otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the ICA Group or holding
company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the ICA Group or holding
company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the extent the Issuer has confirmed to
the Security Agent that it is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is
a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all
Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a member
of the ICA Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any Transaction Security which is being effected

result of an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event, or
(c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a
Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Topco Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of
the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that
Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any
consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the GP to release (A) that
Debtor, the GP (to the extent relevant) and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its
borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities (but excluding any Pension Priority Liabilities); (B) any
Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets, and
(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor
over the GP and/or that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of the GP and/or that Debtor,
on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

145


-----

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities (but excluding any Pension Priority Liabilities); (B) any
Transaction Security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over
any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated
Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that
Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of the GP, a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement)
decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities (other than Pension Priority Liabilities) owed by the
GP, such Debtor or holding company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that
any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any
Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any
Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the
liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors; and

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of the GP, a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of
the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities)
to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities,
liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application
_of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the_
extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions
(although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of
liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to
release the GP, any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed
to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash
management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant
senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and
have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to release
the GP, any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any
Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any
other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of
cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Senior Secured
Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or unsecured liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to a holding
company of the Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or
the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute
such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected
such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in a borrower or
issuer of, or over assets of a borrower or issuer of, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities will be released pursuant
to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent, Second Lien Notes Trustee, Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as
applicable) have approved the release; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor (a “Second Lien Guarantor”) in respect of
Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Guarantor are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other marketable
securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially in cash) and/
or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has been obtained in accordance with the
provisions set out below; and

(B) all claims of the Secured Parties (other than in relation to (x) performance bonds, guarantees or
similar instruments issued by a Secured Creditor on behalf of a member of the ICA Group or
(y) Pension Scheme Liabilities) against a member of the ICA Group (if any) and the GP (if any),
all of whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the ICA Group)
are pledged in favor of the Priority Secured Parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to such
Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all
Transaction Security, Topco Independent Transaction Security or other security in favor of the
Secured Parties in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of
a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(I) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent and
any senior secured notes trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the
Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged
but nevertheless less than the outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, and (ii) serve a notice
on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

(II) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien Agent
and any second lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the
Priority Secured Parties (collectively) will recover more than if such claim was released or
discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding amount of the liabilities owed to the
Priority Secured Parties (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”), and (ii) serve a notice on the
Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same; and

(III) where the Topco Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Topco Agent and the
Topco Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Priority
Secured Parties and the Topco Creditors (collectively) will recover more than if such claim
was released or discharged but is nevertheless less than the outstanding Priority Secured
Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (collectively), and (ii) serve a notice on the Security
Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same,

147


-----

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to
such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer
may be in the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors, Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (whichever constitutes the Instructing Group) bidding by an
appropriate mechanic the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities
(as applicable) such that the relevant liabilities would on completion be discharged to the extent of
an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant creditors; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance with the
advice of a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third party
professional firm with a view to obtaining the best price reasonably obtainable taking into
account all relevant circumstances and in which creditors under the Second Lien Liabilities
and Topco Liabilities are entitled to participate as prospective buyers and/or financiers; or

(II) where a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing such valuations has delivered an
opinion (including an enterprise valuation) in respect of such sale or disposal that the
amount is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such
investment bank, firm of accountants or third party professional firm in giving such
opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first date on
which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are not borne by
the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement Date
bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of
creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors
in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security Agent, provided that,
to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or
consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors,
only written agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under “— Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of each of the agents or trustees
(acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the
Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (i) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the
proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management
Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of
any other creditor or class of creditors), (ii) each Hedge Counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or
waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of
creditors), (iii) each creditor in respect of Pension Priority Liabilities (but only to the extent that such amendment or
waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of that creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement in
its capacity as such and would not materially adversely affect the rights of any other creditor or class of creditors) and
(iv) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it represents
or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or authorizations in
accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to any provision affecting
the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent may, if
the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents under, any
document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be binding on each
party and the prior consent of the Secured Parties is required to authorize any amendment, release or waiver of, or
consent under, any document creating Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the
assets subject to Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed.

150


-----

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations which
are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation, any
ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the
consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security
_Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to (i) any release_
of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the
Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of
additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,” “—Non-Distressed Disposals”
and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Issuer and the Security
Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action or to
provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or another applicable
agreement (but excluding any indenture), any creditor fails to respond to the request within ten business days (or any
other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the agreement of each of the agents or trustee in the case of a shorter
period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such creditor will be disregarded or be deemed to
have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification,
as applicable.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the ICA Group (or a holding company thereof) (an “IPO”),
the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst
other things, (i) the ICA Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the ICA Group or holding
company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown
Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity
shall be any holding company of the Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown
Entity, (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will
cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider,
Investor (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be released
from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities, noteholders
representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any
Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the
majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco
Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall also be released
from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than,
in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any
amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt
Documents to the contrary.

**PIK Toggle Notes**

In connection with the Transactions, on or prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, PIK Holdco, an indirect
holding company of the Issuer, will issue up to €100 million of senior secured PIK toggle notes due 2024 in a private
placement. The PIK Toggle Notes will mature six months following the maturity date of the Notes, unless earlier
redeemed or repurchased and cancelled in accordance with the indenture governing the PIK Toggle Notes.

151


-----

Interest on the PIK Toggle Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears in cash or in kind at the sole option of
PIK Holdco, provided that the last interest payment will be made entirely in cash.

The PIK Toggle Notes will not be guaranteed and will be secured by first-ranking security interests over the
shares of PIK Holdco and any shareholder debt owing by PIK Holdco. The PIK Toggle Notes will not benefit from any
credit support from the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries. The PIK Toggle Notes will be
senior obligations of PIK Holdco and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the
subsidiaries of PIK Holdco, including the Notes issued hereby, borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility, trade payables and lease obligations.

The indenture governing the PIK Toggle Notes will contain certain restrictive covenants, which, subject to
certain exceptions, will be substantially similar to the covenants governing the Notes, which are set forth under
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.” In connection with the issuance of the PIK Toggle Notes, PIK Holdco
will enter into a subordination agreement to govern, inter alia, the relationships and relative priorities among the holders
of the PIK Toggle Notes and PIK Holdco’s shareholders.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the € million aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured
Notes due 2024 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and the € million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes
due 2024 (the “Floating Rate Notes” and together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by
LSF10 Wolverine Investments S.C.A. (the “Issuer”). You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this
“Description of the Notes” under the heading “Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,”
references to the “Issuer,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer only to LSF10 Wolverine Investments S.C.A. and not to any of its
Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture to be dated as of, 2018 (the “Indenture”), between,
_inter alios, the Issuer, LSF10 Wolverine Bidco ApS (the “Issue Date Guarantor”), as a Guarantor, Deutsche Trustee_
Company Limited, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as calculation agent,
paying agent and security agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”), and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as
registrar and transfer agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the
provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, including Section 316(b) of such Act. Consequently, the
Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued
under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain
conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

The Issuer will use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with the proceeds
from the Equity Contribution, to (i) fund the purchase price for the Acquisition, (ii) fund cash to the balance sheet of the
Target for general corporate purposes and (iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions,
including fees and expenses in connection with this offering of the Notes. Pending the consummation of the Acquisition
and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the initial purchasers of the Notes will, concurrently
with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes
into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow deed (the “Escrow Agreement”) dated
as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee and Wells Fargo Bank N.A., London Branch, as escrow agent (the
“Escrow Agent”). If the Acquisition is not consummated or the other conditions to release of the Escrowed Property (as
defined herein), as more fully described below under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” have not been satisfied, on or prior to July 31, 2018 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence_
of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and the
Issue Date Guarantor, as Guarantor, and will not be guaranteed by the Target or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.
Assuming the Completion Date occurs on or prior to the Business Day immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date
and the Escrowed Property is released from the Escrow Account, the Target and certain of its Restricted Subsidiaries
will enter into one or more supplemental indentures to become a party to the Indenture and will guarantee (subject to the
Agreed Security Principles) the Notes on a senior secured basis upon the earlier of (i) the date such entities guarantee the
Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) 120 days from the Completion Date. Prior to the Completion Date, neither the Issuer
nor the Issue Date Guarantor will control the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the Target or any of its
Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you
that, prior to the Completion Date, the Target and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would otherwise have
been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such
non compliance will not constitute a default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Completion Date.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law and the terms
of the Indenture, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Fixed Rate Notes (the “Additional Fixed Rate Notes”)
and additional Floating Rate Notes (the “Additional Floating Rate Notes” and together with the Additional Fixed Rate
Notes, the “Additional Notes”); provided that if the Additional Fixed Rate Notes are not fungible with the Fixed Rate
Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the Additional Floating Rate Notes are not fungible with
the Floating Rate Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, respectively, such Additional Fixed Rate
Notes or Additional Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code or
other identifying number, as applicable, from the Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, originally
issued. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture,
including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens. See “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Except as otherwise_

153


-----

provided for in the Indenture, each of the Fixed Rate Notes (together with any Additional Fixed Rate Notes) and
Floating Rate Notes (together with any Additional Floating Rate Notes) will constitute a separate series of Notes, but
shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver or
other modification of the Indenture, redemption and offers to purchase or any other action by the Holders hereunder.
Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Fixed
Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes and any Additional Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes that are actually
issued under the Indenture.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect
of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness,
turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security
Agent. See “Description of Certain Finance Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the
Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Security Documents. Since this
description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the
Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents will be available from us upon request on and after the Issue Date.

The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights
under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The
Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer
restrictions.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

     - be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

     - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving
Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;

     - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

     - on the Issue Date, be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the
Issuer that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such obligation or indebtedness, and on and after the Completion Date, be
effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such obligation or indebtedness;

     - on the Issue Date, be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantor and (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles), on the earlier of (i) the date such entity guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
(ii) 120 days from the Completion Date, by the Post-Completion Guarantors (as defined below), in each
case, on a senior secured basis;

     - following the Completion Date, be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the
Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors;

     - mature on, 2024; and

     - be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by Definitive Registered Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

154


-----

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the
Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of the
Notes Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility,
certain future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari
_passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes, following the_
payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and the Security Agent (and
any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future indebtedness permitted
under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security interests.

The Issuer is a newly formed holding company incorporated for the purposes of the Transactions, with no
material operations of its own and only limited assets. Prior to the Completion Date, the only Subsidiary of the Issuer
will be the Issue Date Guarantor. Following the Completion Date, the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through
the Target and its Subsidiaries. Therefore, after the Completion Date, the Issuer will depend on the receipt of funds from
its Subsidiaries (whether in the form of dividends, other distributions, return on capital or payments with respect to
intercompany obligations) to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The Notes will be
structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade
payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, the Issue Date Guarantor, and as of Completion Date, all of the Issuer’s other Subsidiaries
(including the Target and its Subsidiaries), will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes of the Indenture. However,
under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries” and consistent with the definition set forth under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we_
will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries
will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

**_The Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantor. On the earlier of (i) the date
such entities guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) 120 days from the Completion Date, the Notes will also be
guaranteed by the Post-Completion Guarantors. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee in the future._

Once granted, the Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

     - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

     - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not
subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain Hedging Obligations);

     - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee;

     - be effectively senior to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor that is not secured
by the Collateral owned by that Guarantor, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

     - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

     - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness, including obligations to trade creditors,
of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or
otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. In addition, the Notes Guarantees will be further limited as required
under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under “—Notes Guarantees—General.” By virtue of these
limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the_

155


-----

_Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

As of October 31, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated
Subsidiaries would have had €515.0 million of Indebtedness secured by the Collateral (excluding €100.0 million
available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility). Based on our current estimate of our cash flow and
operations, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility on the Completion Date to meet our seasonal working
capital requirements. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.” In addition, the_
Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries would have had no other financial indebtedness outstanding.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €515.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes, consisting of
€ million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes and € million in aggregate principal
amount of Floating Rate Notes. The Notes will mature on, 2024. The Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Interest on the Notes will be calculated
on the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding.

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes
will be payable semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing on, 2018. The Issuer will
make each interest payment to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding and . Interest on
the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most
recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal
to the sum of (i) three month EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) plus (ii) %, as determined by the Calculation Agent.
Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on,, and
of each year, commencing on, 2018. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of
record on the immediately preceding,, and . Interest on the Floating Rate Notes
will accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Floating Rate Notes.

“Calculation Agent” means a financial institution appointed by the Issuer to calculate the interest rate payable on
the Floating Rate Notes in respect of each interest period, which shall initially be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits
in euro for a three month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination
Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Page 248
does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London
office or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the euro zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to
provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels
time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative
Amount in euro for a three month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of
three major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a

156


-----

Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three month period beginning on the day that is two
TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the
Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than such rates are so provided then the rate for the
Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

“euro zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the Euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first
Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include, 2018.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single
transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page 248” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that
page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans European Automated Real Time Gross Settlement
Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest
Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal
amount of each Floating Rate Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such
amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to
the nearest euro cent (with one half euro cent being rounded upwards). All percentages resulting from any of the above
calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one
millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or
.0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the
absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of
interest on the Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however,
that none of the Calculation Agent, the Trustee or the Paying Agent shall be responsible for verifying that the rate of
interest on the Floating Rate Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at
which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any
such delay.

If the Issuer redeems any Global Notes on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the
corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be
paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record
date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer. The
right of Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payment on such Notes will be subject to the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be
made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the
registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such_
purposes in London, United Kingdom. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option
of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes
for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in London, United Kingdom (including the
initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

157


-----

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg
S.A. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and
together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Notes
shall be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of Notes kept by the
Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the Issuer shall prevail.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
Holders of such Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting
from a Change of Control, will be guaranteed (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) by the Issue Date Guarantor.
Additionally, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, on the earlier of
(i) the date a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issue Date Guarantor guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) 120
days from the Completion Date, the Notes will also be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis (each,
a “Notes Guarantee” and together, the “Notes Guarantees”), by the Target and certain of its Subsidiaries (each, a “Post_Completion Guarantor” and together with the Issue Date Guarantor, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantors also guarantee_
our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain guarantee limitations as set out therein.

The Guarantors, the type of Guarantor and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation will be as follows:

**Guarantor** **Type of Guarantor** **Jurisdiction**

LSF10 Wolverine Bidco ApS . . . . . . . . Issue Date Guarantor Denmark
Stark Danmark A/S . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post-Completion Guarantor Denmark
Stark Group A/S . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post-Completion Guarantor Denmark
DT Finland Oy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post-Completion Guarantor Finland
Neumann Bygg AS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post-Completion Guarantor Norway
DT Holding (Sweden) AB . . . . . . . . . . . Post-Completion Guarantor Sweden
Beijer Byggmaterial Aktiebolag . . . . . . Post-Completion Guarantor Sweden

In addition, as described below “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the
Revolving Credit Facility or any Public Debt in the future, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into
a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of
guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or
requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules,
capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the
guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations
subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable
provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with
corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements
_and the Notes—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_
_enforceability.”_

Following the Completion Date, a portion of the operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (together,
the “Group”) will be conducted through Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not be Guarantors. Claims of
creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees
issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and

158


-----

minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with
respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the
Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to
creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other
than Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

Management estimates that the Guarantors (other than the Issue Date Guarantor) accounted for at least 80% of
total revenue for the Ongoing Business and at least 80% of Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year
ended July 31, 2017, and held at least 80% of our total assets as of July 31, 2017. Management estimates that the
subsidiaries of the Target that will not be Guarantors accounted for less than 20% of total revenue for the Ongoing
Business and less than 20% of Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, and held
less than 20% of our total assets as of July 31, 2017. Within 120 days following the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to
certain adjustments and the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer is required to ensure that the Guarantors (other than
Bidco) accounted for at least 80% of (i) total revenue for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017,
(ii) Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017 and (iii) total assets as of July 31,
2017. As of October 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Target’s subsidiaries that will not be
Guarantors would have had no third-party debt outstanding. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence
by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under
the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Notes Guarantees Release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

     - upon (a) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of any Capital Stock of
the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of
which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary, or (b) the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
combination) (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture;

     - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

     - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes in accordance with
the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

     - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

     - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

     - as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Notes Guarantees”;_

     - as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

     - in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

     - upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under
the Indenture and the Notes; or

     - by written notice from the Issuer to the Trustee upon the Notes achieving Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall each take all necessary actions reasonably requested by
the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee or the
Security Agent without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the
Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release,
termination or discharge. The Issuer may in its sole discretion elect to have any Notes Guarantee remain in place, as
opposed to being released.

159


-----

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, concurrently with
the closing of this offering of Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee
and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Issuer will instruct the initial purchasers of the Notes to deposit with the
Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the
Escrow Account. The Escrow Account and the Issuer’s rights under the Escrow Agreement will be pledged on a firstpriority basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to an escrow account charge dated the Issue
Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and
all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow
Account, (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as
the “Escrowed Property.”

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, at a time that is on or before the Escrow Longstop Date, an
Officer’s Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall conclusively rely, without further
investigation or liability, to the effect that:

     - prior to, or substantially concurrently with the release of the Escrowed Property, the Equity Contribution
will be made;

     - the Acquisition will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Acquisition Agreement, promptly
following release of the Escrowed Property, except for any changes or other modifications that will not,
individually or when taken as whole, have a material adverse effect on the Holders (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer);

     - immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, (i) the Issuer will own, directly or indirectly, the entire
share capital of the Target (excluding any de minimis amounts held by managers or directors of the Target
or its Affiliates, if any) and (ii) LSF10 Wolverine Holdings S.à r.l. and LSF10 Wolverine GP S.à r.l. (“Lux
_GP”) will own, directly or indirectly, the entire share capital of the Issuer (excluding any de minimis_
amounts held by managers or directors of the Target or its Affiliates, if any); and

     - as of the Completion Date, there is no Event of Default under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the
heading titled “Events of Default” below with respect to the Issuer.

The Release shall occur promptly upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above on the Completion Date
on or prior to the Business Day immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date. Upon the Release, the Escrow
Account shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be paid out in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

In the event that (a) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Business Day immediately
following the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) the Issuer notifies the Trustee and the Escrow Agent that in its reasonable
judgment the Acquisition will not be consummated by the Business Day immediately following the Escrow Longstop
Date, (c) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (d) the Initial Investors
cease to beneficially own and control a majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Issuer or (e) an Event
of Default with respect to the Issuer arises under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “Events of
_Default” below on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination_
_Date”), the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory_
_Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest and_
Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Holders, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, and will provide that the
Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any
excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer.

160


-----

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption
exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, Lone Star Fund X (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) will be
required to make an equity contribution to the Issuer in an amount required to enable the Issuer to pay the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price owing to the Holders, pursuant to the Special Mandatory Redemption. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Acquisition—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied,_
_the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the_
_Notes.” For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any_
Person as a result of any failure by the Issuer to pay to the Paying Agent any supplemental amounts required if the
Special Mandatory Redemption Price is in excess of the Escrowed Property.

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Holders a Security Interest (as defined herein) over the Escrowed Property and the Issuer’s rights under the
Escrow Agreement. Receipt by the Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a notice of Special
Mandatory Redemption (provided funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price are in the Escrow
Account) shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow
Charge.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange
and the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority that the Special Mandatory Redemption has
occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees in respect thereof, on the Issue Date, will be secured only by the Escrow
Charge.

On or prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer will, and will cause LSF10 Wolverine Holdings S.à r.l., the direct
Parent Entity of the Issuer (the “Topco Security Provider”), and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, grant Liens and Security Interests on an equal and ratable
first priority basis, subject to certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, over: (i) the capital
stock of the Issuer and Lux GP held by the Topco Security Provider, (ii) any preferred equity certificates issued by the
Issuer and Lux GP held by the Topco Security Provider, (iii) certain intercompany receivables owed to the Topco
Security Provider by the Issuer and Lux GP, (iv) the capital stock of the Bidco held by the Issuer, (v) the material bank
accounts of the Issuer held in Luxembourg, (vi) certain intercompany receivables owed to Lux Holdco by Bidco,
(vii) Bidco’s rights under the Acquisition Agreement and (viii) Bidco’s material bank accounts held in Denmark
(together, the “Completion Date Collateral”).

Furthermore, pursuant to the Security Documents to be entered into within no later than 10 business days from
the Completion Date and substantially simultaneously with our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Issuer will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, grant Liens and Security Interests on an equal and ratable first
priority basis, subject to certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, over: (i) the capital stock of
the Target held by Bidco and (ii) certain intercompany receivables owed to Bidco by the Target (together, the “Initial
_Post-Completion Date Collateral”)._

Additionally, on the earlier of (a) the date on which our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will be so
secured and (b) 120 days from the Completion Date, and substantially simultaneously with our obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Issuer will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, grant Liens and Security Interests on
an equal and ratable first priority basis, subject to certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens,
over shares in and over the material bank accounts of each Guarantor (the “Additional Post-Completion Date Collateral”
and together with the Escrow Charge, the Completion Date Collateral and the Initial Post-Completion Date Collateral,
the “Collateral”).

The Collateral (other than the Escrow Charge over the Escrow Account) will be granted, in each case, to the
Security Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the Security Documents, creating an effective
Security Interest over the relevant assets.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first priority security interests over the Collateral securing the Notes
are contractually deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the extent that such security

161


-----

is expressed to secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) certain obligations under
hedging arrangements and (iii) certain other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. Under the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Revolving Credit
Facility or the Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of the Notes
Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain
future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with
the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes, following the payment of
fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver
or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future indebtedness permitted under the
terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security interests.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or
Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders
and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other security interests that may in
the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also
constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any
Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable
law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets (other than the Collateral described in the first and_
second paragraphs of this section) may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited
(or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive
summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among others:

to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

     - the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the Security Agent
and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security documents for all
the secured creditors); provided that it shall be permissible to use “parallel debt” provisions where necessary
(which shall be included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security documents); and

     - the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like

equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the
right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of
the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the
interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security
document; provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time) to obtain consent to
charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies
prior to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is material and will not involve placing
relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

     - the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantees and that security will not be required from or over

that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group;

     - the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection
of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise
permitted by the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (including dealing with the secured assets and all
contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or
obligations, in each case prior to an Event of Default which is continuing), and the agreement that any
requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other
action shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles; and

     - the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other
action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or in China,
Lithuania, the Faroe Islands and Greenland (the “Excluded Jurisdictions”) or otherwise over the shares of a
member of the Group located in an Excluded Jurisdiction.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the
Issuer.

As described above, all of the Collateral also secures the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and may
also secure certain Hedging Obligations, any Additional Notes as well as certain other future Indebtedness, certain of

163


-----

which is entitled to payment from the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. The proceeds
from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral
may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Financing
_Arrangements and the Notes—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security Documents
(the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility,
(b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar and the Holders under the Indenture and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness
(including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, will be
established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that the first priority
security interests securing the Notes are contractually deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but
only to the extent that such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility, (ii) certain obligations under hedging arrangements and (iii) certain other future indebtedness permitted to be
incurred under the Indenture; provided, however, that under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain
conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the
Notes, including from the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in
respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) in
priority to the Notes, following the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative
of future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security interests. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” “—Security—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—_
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Security Provider, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the
Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the
Notes Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and
the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will
act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to
time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Escrow Charge shall be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders, and no other
persons (including for the avoidance of doubt any lender under the Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties under any
Hedging Obligations or any other creditors) shall be entitled to benefit from the Escrow Charge.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only
the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a
consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide
instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence
governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests, the relevant Security Documents will secure “parallel debt”
obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in certain of these
jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—The security interests in
_the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent (on behalf of the holders of the Notes) rather than directly to the holders_
_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all
obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the
Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

164


-----

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor
Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security
Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—The granting of the
_security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt or other obligations in_
_the future, may create or restart hardening periods.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the
Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain
circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Security Interests.” The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future_
Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the
Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security
Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness,
including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to Hedging
Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to
have, authorized the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights,
powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents
securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions and (ii) execute each
Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and
perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its
behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—The
_security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent (on behalf of the holders of the Notes) rather_
_than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be_
_restricted by local law.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

165


-----

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Issuer held by the Topco Security Provider and Lux GP,
in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not
prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be
relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or intercompany loan receivables to a Restricted
Subsidiary (except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject
to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Issuer as Receivables Assets in
connection with a Receivables Facility;

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(7) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

The Security Interests over the assets subject to the Escrow Charge will be released upon the occurrence of the
Release or in connection with the Special Mandatory Redemption. In addition, the Security Interests created by the
Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”_

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by
the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of
the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security
Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely conclusively upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of
Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has
occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture; provided, however, that with respect to the release of the
collateral subject to the Escrow Charge, the Trustee shall also be entitled to receive (i) in connection with a Release, an
Officer’s Certificate certifying satisfaction of the conditions for the Release and (ii) in connection with the Special
Mandatory Redemption, a notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will initially be issued as follows:

     - each series of Fixed Rate Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Fixed Rate Notes”) and each series of Floating
Rate Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest

coupons attached (the “144A Global Floating Rate Notes” and together with the 144A Global Floating Rate
Notes, the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream; and

     - each series of Fixed Rate Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Fixed Rate Global Notes”) and each series of Floating Rate Notes sold outside
the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Floating Rate
_Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Fixed Rate Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and,_
together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue
Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions” In
addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be
effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and
procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book- Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a Person
who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry
_Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form_
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified
institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or
otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with
any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

No Book Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Global Fixed Rate Notes”),
and no Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book Entry Interest in the Global Fixed Rate Notes (the
“Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Notes”), may be transferred or exchanged for any Book Entry Interest in any Global
Note representing the Floating Rate Notes (the “Global Floating Rate Notes”) or any Definitive Registered Note issued
in exchange for a Book Entry Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes (the “Definitive Registered Floating Rate
_Notes”), and no Book Entry Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes and no Definitive Registered Floating Rate Note_
may be transferred or exchanged for any Book Entry Interest in any Global Fixed Rate Note or any Definitive Registered
Fixed Rate Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a BookEntry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become
subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to
which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating
thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such
instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant
which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest
will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be
subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more
fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

167


-----

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the
transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to
furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish
certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer
or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be
entitled to treat the registered Holder as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Immediately after the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries and, immediately
after the Completion Date, the Target and all of its Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to
designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” or “—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer._

**_General_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control
Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice,
given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in
whole, but not in part following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any
early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we may
repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the
Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes
will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

Other than in an event of a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer is not required to make mandatory
redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the

169


-----

Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by
them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption
of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). Under the existing practices of Euroclear
and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book Entry Interest of less than €100,000
principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through Euroclear and Clearstream the Notes will be
selected on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding
after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be
redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and
the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing
in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except
that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the
notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a
transaction (including an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and
any redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not
limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (provided, however, that any redemption date shall not be
more than 60 days after the date of the notice of redemption) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall
not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Issuer may
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to
such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of
the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the relevant Notes and,
in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change in the principal amount of Notes
outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of
the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be
made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.
Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in
the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “—Withholding
_Taxes,” if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or_
otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

170


-----

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such
laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to
pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such
Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The
foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least
one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts.
Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver
to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement
of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written
opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (as defined below in “—Withholding Taxes”) and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without
further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of
and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes
is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the
jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any
Note or any Notes Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of principal, redemption price, interest or
premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”)
as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such
withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less
than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Note or
Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts
will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present
or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an

171


-----

estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or
carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of management present or
deemed present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in
each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the
receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes
Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or
deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any
declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is
required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case,
only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment
(where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30
days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available
for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, in each
case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any
current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or similar law or
regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such
fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable endeavors to
obtain and provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from
each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying
Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the
offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Notes
Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent
an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so
payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant
payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment
date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

172


-----

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional
Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any
other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of,
or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer after this offering) and limited,
solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or
interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3)
and (5) through (7) (save that in respect of clause (5), this proviso shall not apply in connection with excise, transfer,
personal property or similar Taxes).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by
a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is
incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any
jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by
or on behalf of such Person, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a
change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith
delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the
Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (equal to €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof; provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer
described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase;
_provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment_
date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive
interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will
deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at
the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering
Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which
date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and
(y) the date of completion of the Change of Control Triggering Event, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a
Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.
The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend
enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default
under the Revolving Credit Facility that permits the Revolving Credit Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of

173


-----

borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on
certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require
the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control
Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature
of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the
removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations
between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering
Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise
affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority_
in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the
Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering
Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of
redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional
_Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date_
or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption
notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event; provided, however, that such Change of Control offer is conditional
upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may
require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Authority and if and to the extent that the rules
of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance of
doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.

**_Termination of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

174


-----

then, beginning on that day and continuing at all times thereafter regardless of any subsequent changes in the rating of
the Notes, the covenants described under the following captions in this “Description of the Notes” will no longer be
applicable as to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees:

     - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

     - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

     - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

     - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

     - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

     - “—Additional Notes Guarantees”; and

     - the provisions of clause (c) of the first paragraph of “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”;

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Notes Guarantees shall be released.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The Trustee
shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the
Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the
Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition
for termination of the covenants to be effective.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to 1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

(1) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit Facility (and
the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) in an aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the sum of an amount equal to the greater of (x)
€115.0 million and (y) 106% of LTM EBITDA, in each case, at any one time outstanding, provided that
any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing
does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred
pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of such refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced at such time, together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or
similar fees) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing_
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness or other obligations is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

175


-----

(4) (a) Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the Issue Date and of the
Target Group outstanding as of the Issue Date, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and the
application of the proceeds therefrom (as described under “Use of Proceeds” in this Offering
Memorandum), (b) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), including
any Guarantees thereof, (c) Refinancing Indebtedness (including with respect to the Notes and any
Guarantee thereof) Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) and clause (5) of
this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and (d) other Indebtedness
Incurred to finance Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (x) of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, or any Person that will become a
Restricted Subsidiary or that will be merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, Incurred or issued to finance all or a portion of an acquisition
(including an acquisition of any assets or any Person) or (y) of Persons that are, or secured by any assets
that are, acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into, amalgamated or consolidated
with the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; provided that
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (5) is in an aggregate amount not to exceed (a) the
greater of (i) €12.5 million and (ii) 12% of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, plus (b) unlimited
additional Indebtedness to the extent that after giving effect to such acquisition, merger or consolidation
and without giving effect to any Indebtedness Incurred or issued pursuant to subclause (5)(a) above on the
date of determination, either: (i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be permitted to Incur at
least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant; or (ii) either the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower, or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer would not be higher, in each case, than it was
immediately prior to such acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation;

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes as determined
in good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness (a) represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money
Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price
or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in a Similar Business or
Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction,
installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar
Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness in an aggregate
outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of
(i) €25.0 million and (ii) 23% of LTM EBITDA at any time outstanding, and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof (provided that, in each case, the Indebtedness exists on the date of such
purchase, lease, rental, construction, design, installation or improvement or is created within 270 days
thereafter); or (b) arising out of Sale and Leaseback Transactions;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, unemployment
insurance (including premiums related thereto), other types of social security, pension obligations or
partial retirement obligations, vacation pay, health, disability or other employee benefits, customer
guarantees performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeals, advance payment (including progress
premiums), customs, value added or other tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or
obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or
relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice; (b) the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar
instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice; provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within 30 Business Days of
Incurrence; (c) customer deposits and advance payments (including progress premiums) received in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice from customers for goods or services
purchased in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; (d) letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances, warehouse receipts, guarantees, discounted bills of exchange or the discounting of factoring
of receivables for credit management of bad debt purposes or other similar instruments or obligations
issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practice; (e) the financing of insurance premiums, take-or-pay obligations contained in supply
arrangements, any customary treasury and/or cash management services, depositary, cash management,

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled
to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include,
in any manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the
second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted
solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one
such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;
_provided that any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed to be incurred_
under clause (1) of the preceding paragraph and cannot be reclassified;

(2) with respect to any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to a clause limited by a fixed amount in the second
paragraph of this covenant (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant
to clause (1) of the preceding paragraph which shall not be reclassified), if at any time that the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall be
automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant;

(3) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down”
provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be
repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date
such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest
and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of
a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of the second
paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or

178


-----

repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(8) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing
would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the
percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA
restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any
premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
(including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in connection with
such refinancing;

(9) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to
the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and

(10) the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred and Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that may be
issued pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and clause (13) of the second paragraph of this
covenant by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed the greater of
(x) €50.0 million and (y) 46% of LTM EBITDA at any one time outstanding.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of
additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not
treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of
this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to
be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in
default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case
of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro equivalent), in the case of revolving
credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign
currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
(x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting
discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including
original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in
effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Issuer or a Guarantor will not Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is
also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the relevant Notes Guarantee, on substantially
identical terms; provided, however, that for purposes of the Indenture, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue
of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior Lien basis, secured on different collateral or guaranteed by
different obligors, or by virtue of the application of “waterfall” or other payment ordering provisions affecting tranches
of Indebtedness.

Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that
would otherwise have constituted a Change of Control Triggering Event, (b) the purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt

this covenant (other than pursuant to clause (12) hereof) or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted
_Investments” (other than pursuant to clause (12) thereof); and_

(22) any Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed an amount equal to the sum of Retained
Declined Proceeds.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment or Investment
(or, in each case, portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described
in clauses (1) through (22) above, and/or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more
of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” the Issuer will be entitled to classify such
Restricted Payment or Investment (or, in each case, portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based
on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or, in each case,
portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including in each case as an Investment pursuant to one
or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” and may aggregate capacity in multiple
clauses of the definition of Permitted Payments above, the first paragraph of this covenant and/or in the definition of
“Permitted Investments” in any manner that complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted
Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other
than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in a Permitted
Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the
Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to
Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary),
whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom,
which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset
that does not constitute Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens or (ii) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if
the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, equally
and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by
such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that
constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes under (a)(ii) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and
(b) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such

186


-----

Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness
in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the
payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or
liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends_
or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any
standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness
Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit
Facility), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement or (c) any other agreement or instrument, in the case of (a), (b)
and (c), with respect to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in effect at or entered into on the Issue
Date, and with respect to the Target or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in effect at or entered into on the
Completion Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents or the Notes
Guarantees;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than
Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in connection with such
transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person
is the Successor Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or
any such Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer;

(5) any encumbrance, restriction or condition:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset
that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or transfer of
any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of
the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;

187


-----

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other
agreement to which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; provided that such agreement
prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the
proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes
customary restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect
sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and other
similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of, or pursuant to, applicable law or any
applicable rule, regulation, licensing requirement or order, or required by any regulatory authority or any
governmental license, concessions, franchises or permits, including restrictions on encumbrances on cash
or deposits (including assets in escrow accounts) paid on property;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers,
or as required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities, in each case, under agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(12) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility
that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such Securitization
Facility or Receivables Facility;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Revolving Credit
Facility, together with the Security Documents associated therewith, and (B) the Intercreditor Agreement,
in the case of (A) as in effect on the Completion Date and in the case of (B) as in effect on the Issue Date
or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) and where, in
the case of this subclause (ii), either (x) the Issuer determines at the time of entry into such agreement or
instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the
Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction
applies only during the continuance of a default relating to such agreement or instrument, or
(b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of this
paragraph or this clause; provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such

188


-----

Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material
respect to the Holders (taken as a whole) than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial
Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at
least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), with a purchase price in excess of the greater of (a) €15.0 million
and (b) 14% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash
or Cash Equivalents (provided, however, that in the case of Asset Dispositions involving the disposition
of non-core assets at fair market value (each, as determined by the Issuer in its good faith judgment)
acquired as part of any acquisition after the Issue Date in which the value of such non-core assets does not
exceed 50% of the consideration payable in connection with such acquisition, only 50% of the
consideration therefor must be in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents); and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects (i) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase
any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), any Senior Secured Indebtedness
or any other Indebtedness under any Credit Facility Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (or any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 450 days from the later of (x) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (y) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection
with any prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(a), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid,
repaid or purchased; provided further that, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary elects to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase any Indebtedness
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary shall be
under no obligation to redeem, repay or purchase a pro rata portion of the Notes, (ii) to (A)
purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise or (B) redeem Notes pursuant to the optional
redemption provisions of the Indenture; provided that, in each case, the relevant purchase,
repurchase or redemption is launched, or the relevant redemption notice is delivered within, 450
days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash, or (iii) to make an Asset Disposition Offer in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture;

(b) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or purchase or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries) within 450 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement shall
be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment
with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to
satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (a “Commitment”); provided
_further that if any Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount_
is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds; or

189


-----

(c) to consummate any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, (1) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_
accordance with clauses (a), (b) or (c) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily
reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture and (2) the Issuer (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in
Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net Available Cash attributable to any given Asset Disposition
(provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of execution of a definitive
agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset Disposition) and
deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above with
respect to such Asset Disposition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any
Asset Disposition by a Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to
comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate
benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the
Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to
the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by
the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in
compliance with this covenant.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”
under the Indenture. On the 451st day after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash (or
(i) such earlier date as the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries may elect or (ii) such later date as set forth in clause (3)(b)
of the first paragraph of this covenant), if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds
€25.0 million, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all
Holders issued under such Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and to repay, prepay or purchase any such Pari Passu
Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer
price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and not more than 100%
of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or
the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and which may include in the case of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt, such higher price as may be contemplated by the agreement governing such Pari
Passu Indebtedness, and with respect to the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class
mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the
transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified
purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days
from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice.
The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by
making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days
(or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose
not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition
Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount
of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an
unauthorized denomination.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in Euro, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro-equivalent amount determined as
of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of
any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Issuer may, at its

190


-----

option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation
of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net
Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose
not prohibited by the Indenture.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euro that
is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Euro.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the
release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability
in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any
Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed
the greater of (a) €35.0 million and (b) 32% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value);

(6) consideration consisting of Additional Assets; and

(7) any combination of the consideration specified in the preceding clauses (1) through (6).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture relative to
the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or
modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

The Revolving Credit Facility may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which
the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the
event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase
of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such
consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure
to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction or
series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any
service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate

_Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (i) €10.0 million and (ii) 9% of LTM EBITDA_
unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of (a)
€20.0 million and (b) 18% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved
by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” or any Permitted Investment;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into,

agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements,
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any
Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long- term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans, transaction bonuses or transaction-related securities repurchase plans or similar
employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation,
severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on
behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in
each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries and
(b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, provided that such Parent Entity
shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital
Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise permitted under the
Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on
behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the Issuer, any Parent
Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Controlled
Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any
agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date (with respect to the Issuer and the Issue Date
Guarantor) or the Completion Date (with respect to the Target and its Restricted Subsidiaries), as
applicable, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended,
renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the
extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

(7) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility, any
disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets, Receivables Assets or related assets in connection with
any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, franchisees, contractors, distributors
or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent

determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely (i) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise
controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a director of such Person is
also a director of the Issuer, a Restricted Subsidiary or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer
(provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Issuer, such Restricted
Subsidiary or such direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer, as the case may be, on any matter
involving such other Person);

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock) of
the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder

obligations) in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; provided that such Subordinated
Shareholder Funding, as amended or otherwise modified, will continue to satisfy the requirements
described in the definition “Subordinated Shareholder Funding”;

including an Initial Public Offering) and (b) customary payments by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Entity)

the case of each of clauses (a) and (b) by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all out of pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted Holder in
connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;

(13) the Transactions and the payment of all costs and expenses (including all legal, accounting and other
professional fees and expenses) related to the Transactions;

(14) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a
letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating either (x) that such transaction is fair to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (y) that such transaction meets the
requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(15) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under the
terms of, any equityholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase

enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or
under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date will only be permitted under this clause to
the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to
the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect as determined in good faith by the Issuer;

(16) any purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is purchased by Persons
who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates are on the same
terms as such purchases by such Persons who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates;

third party investors on the same or more favorable terms and (b) payments to Affiliates in respect of

Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary as described under “—Designation of Restricted and

shareholders under any shareholder agreement;

(29) the entry into, and performance of obligations and related services under, any registration rights or other
listing agreement; and

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would
not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market
value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce
the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That_
designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary
otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (and any redesignation of and
Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary) will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail
to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a
Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer will be in default of such covenant.

The Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that
such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding
Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (a) such Indebtedness is
permitted under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including pursuant to clause (5) of the
second paragraph thereof treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a
_pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Relevant Testing Period; and_
(b) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence immediately following such designation.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 150 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year ending July 31, 2018 and within 120 days after the
end of the Issuer’s fiscal years thereafter beginning with the fiscal year ending July 31, 2019, annual
reports containing: (i) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a
discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and material changes in liquidity
and capital resources of the Issuer; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet
information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions
or recapitalizations (other than the Acquisition) that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma information
has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided that such pro forma
financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in
which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials;
(iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years
and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent
two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such
fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (iv) a brief description
of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material Affiliate Transactions and a
description of all material debt instruments of the Group; (v) a description of material operational risk
factors and material subsequent events; and (vi) reported EBITDA; provided that the information
described in clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarters ending January 31, 2018 and April 30, 2018, 90 days)
following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer, beginning with

195


-----

the quarter ending January 31, 2018, quarterly financial statements containing the following information:
(i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and
unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information
of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations (other than the Acquisition) that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma financial
information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the
Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) an operating
and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the
Issuer; (iv) a discussion of material changes in material debt instruments since the most recent report;
(v) material subsequent events and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent
annual report; and (vi) reported EBITDA; provided that the information described in clauses (iv), (v) and
(vi) may be provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; provided further that
notwithstanding anything in this clause (2) to the contrary, if the Release has not occurred on the last day
that the Issuer is permitted to furnish to the Trustee the report for the fiscal quarter ending January 31,
2018 pursuant to this clause (2), the Issuer shall not be required to furnish to the Trustee such report, but
shall instead use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Target to promptly after such due date
publish on its website a trading update for the financial quarter ending January 31, 2018, and upon the
publication of such trading update by the Target, the Issuer shall be deemed to be in compliance with this
clause (2) of this “Reports” covenant; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change
in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes
are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods
presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to
such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure
with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this
Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to
GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s pro forma total revenue or Consolidated
EBITDA or total assets as of and for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have
been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer,
then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the
financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would
satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act (other than the provision of GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and
procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,

196


-----

documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a)
or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in this “Reports” covenant.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on a Recognized Stock Exchange and the Issuer or
such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity
securities admitted to trading on such Recognized Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available
to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to
file with such Recognized Stock Exchange. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such
requirements require the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information,
documents and other reports with the Recognized Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. “Recognized Stock Exchange” means a regulated
market operated by any of Euronext, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the London Stock Exchange (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, AIM and Main Market listings), the Deutsche Börse, the Paris Stock Exchange Group, the
Toronto Stock Exchange, TSX Venture Exchange, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the
Singapore Exchange, the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, the Stockholm Stock Exchange, the Helsinki Stock Exchange,
the Oslo Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or such other similar regulated national securities exchange.

At its election, the Issuer may provide consolidated financial statements of a Parent Entity in lieu of those for the
Issuer, in which case references to the Issuer in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to be
references to the Parent Entity, as applicable; provided that if the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Entity
are included in such report, a qualitative description of material differences between the consolidated financial
statements of the Parent Entity and the Issuer shall be included for any period after the Issue Date starting with the
reporting period during which the consolidated financial statements of such Parent Entity are first used.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer shall be entitled to use
or furnish to the Holders, as applicable, the consolidated financial statements of the Target in connection with any
calculation made pursuant to any provision of the Indenture or to comply with the provisions of this “Reports” covenant.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to
take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it
being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person
other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever
in any of the Collateral, except that (a) the Issuer, the Topco Security Provider, Lux GP and any Restricted Subsidiary
may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents, other
than the Escrow Charge, for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (b) the Issuer, the Topco Security
Provider, Lux GP and any Restricted Subsidiary may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise
modify or replace any Security Documents, other than the Escrow Charge, for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted
Reorganization or in connection with any transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Merger and
_Consolidation,” (c) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable_
Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (d) the applicable
Security Documents may be amended from time to time to (i) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or
inconsistency therein, (ii) add to the Collateral, (iii) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer, Topco
Security Provider or any Restricted Subsidiary providing Collateral and the assumption of such successor of the
obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents, in each case,
including in accordance with the terms under “—Merger and Consolidation,” (iv) to evidence and provide for the
acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent, (e) the Issuer, the Topco Security Provider, Lux
GP and any Restricted Subsidiary may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders
in any material respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) and (f) the Security Interests and the related Security
Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by
an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); provided, however, that in the case

197


-----

of clauses (a) and (f) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the
Trustee, either (x) a solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial
Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, (y) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (z) an
Opinion of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or
new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that
the Issuer, the Topco Security Prover, Lux GP or any Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements of this
covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications and each of
the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification or replacement without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Notes Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, no
Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility or any Public
Debt in an aggregate principal amount in excess of €15.0 million, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such
Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor at substantially the same time at which the Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form
attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee, which Notes
Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu, as applicable, with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to
the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or
could give rise to or result in: (a) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance,
fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules, retention of
title claims or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) any risk or
liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the
partners of such partnership); or (c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other
than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on
Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law (including any usury laws).

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release,” or in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security_
Documents. A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of
such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which
could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not
designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, reasonably requested by the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Issuer shall have the right, by execution and delivery of
a supplemental indenture to the Trustee, to cause such Immaterial Subsidiary to cease to be a Guarantor, subject to the
requirement described in the first paragraph above that such Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to become a
Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary (except that if such Subsidiary has been properly designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be so required to become a Guarantor or execute a supplemental indenture).

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Financing

198


-----

_Arrangements and the Notes—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their_
_validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability_
_of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of (x) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise required herein and (y) any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or
their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as
the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including
substantially the same terms with respect to release of Notes Guarantees and priority and release of the Security
Interests; provided that (1) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights,
duties, protections, indemnifications, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than one such intercreditor agreement
is outstanding at any one time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any
such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types (including new Credit Facilities) of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement
(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions
relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional
Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) facilitate a
Permitted Reorganization, (7) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (9) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary
provisions to ensure that the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral. The
Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and
_Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent_
such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, protections, indemnifications or
immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to
the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether
then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the
Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture (including those
based on LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio and/or
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio), in each case, in connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint
venture, Investment, Incurrence, Change of Control or other similar transaction where there is a time difference between
commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness, Restricted Payments, Change

199


-----

of Control and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of
Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such acquisition, disposition, merger,
joint venture, investment, Incurrence, Change of Control or similar transaction are entered into and such baskets or ratios
shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture,
Investment, Incurrence, Change of Control or similar transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition, Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable Relevant Testing
Period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any
subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (1) if any of such baskets or ratios are
exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in LTM EBITDA, Consolidated
EBITDA, Consolidated Total Net Indebtedness, Senior Secured Indebtedness or cash and Cash Equivalents of the Issuer
or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for
purposes of determining whether the transactions are permitted hereunder; and (2) such baskets or ratios shall not be
tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects
to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including
any Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition, Change of Control or Incurrence of Indebtedness and
the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such
agreement and before the consummation of such transactions.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, unless:

(a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan,
Australia, Switzerland, Norway, the United States of America, any State of the United States or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will
expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of
the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture as well as all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Issuer as a
result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at
the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (i) the Issuer or the applicable Successor Issuer
would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately
prior to giving effect to such transaction, or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be higher than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(d) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and
such supplemental indenture (in the case of the Successor Issuer) comply with the Indenture and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (in the case of a Successor Issuer) is a
legal and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer; provided that in giving an Opinion
of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to
satisfaction of clauses (a), (b) and (c) above.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor Person will not be
released from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.

200


-----

**_The Guarantors_**

None of the Guarantors (other than a Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(a) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person; or

(b) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(c) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless either:

(i) either:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) the Issuer or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor
under its Notes Guarantee and the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and

(C) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing; or

(ii) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of
the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any such Guarantor will enter into one or more supplemental indentures to become a party to the Indenture, will
guarantee (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) the Notes and will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_General_**

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
assigning, transferring or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a
Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that (A) if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of
such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses
(a) and (d) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction and (B) there shall be a valid Lien over the
Capital Stock of such surviving entity securing the obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees; and (iv) the
Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the
purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the
legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (a), (b) and (d) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clause (A),
(B) and (C) under the heading “The Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Transactions (and any transaction reasonably related to the Transactions) will
be permitted without compliance with this section.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. See also “—Change of Control.” This paragraph is not intended to
limit the Issuer’s sales or other dispositions of less than substantially all of its assets.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days (or, in the case of an obligation set out in
“—Certain Covenants—Reports,” 120 days) after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders
or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any
agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the
latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether
such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final
maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates €30.0 million or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €30.0 million
other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable
and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a
period of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph) after
such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement
proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly
stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to a material portion of the
Collateral for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the
release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security
Interest, with respect to a material portion of the Collateral, created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security
Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30 days; and

202


-----

(8) any Notes Guarantee by a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Guarantors that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in
accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any Notes Guarantee limitations and the
Agreed Security Principles).

Notwithstanding any other term of this “Description of the Notes” or the Indenture, no Permitted Reorganization
shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in, a breach of any undertaking or other term in this “Description of the
_Notes” or the Indenture, or a Default or an Event of Default, and shall be expressly permitted under the terms of this_
“Description of the Notes” or the Indenture.

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the
Default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6), the Issuer does not cure such Default within 60 days after receipt of such
notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by
written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such
Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable.
Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In
the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events
_of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if_
the Event of Default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or
cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall
have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and
the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the
Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or
existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional
Amounts which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default
for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely
because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for
the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or
otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured
upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though
such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory
to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment
of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

203


-----

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the security and/or
indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to
use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may
refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial
to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under
the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole
discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of
such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being
notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on
any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice
is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 150 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year ending
July 31, 2018 and within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal years thereafter beginning with the fiscal year
ending July 31, 2019, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred
during the previous fiscal year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect the
Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, only the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes (and not the consent of the holders of the majority of all Notes), as
the case may be, shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of
the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes (provided, however, that if any amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification or consent will only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, only the consent of the
holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) of this paragraph, 75%) of the aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes will be required), an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating to
Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

204


-----

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption” or
“—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in
a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit
of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided further, that the release of the Security Interests
created pursuant to the Escrow Charge shall require the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of
the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes (unless such release is otherwise in compliance with
the terms of the Indenture);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of
at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) waive or modify any provision of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to
the release of Escrowed Proceeds) to the extent such provisions relate to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem
the Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption and such waiver or modification adversely affects the right
of any Holders of such Notes in any material respect; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other parties
thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, or conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or a Restricted

or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance of
Additional Notes that may be issued in compliance with the Indenture;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the Covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to_
confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien with
respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for
under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(8) conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this

intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements

Completion Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to
be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Collateral
for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not prohibited by the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(11) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as
permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes; provided,
_however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred_
in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(12) to facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and_
_Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets;_

the Indenture under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, if such qualification is required.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants” or this section “Amendments and Waivers” shall be deemed to impair or affect
any rights of Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to
require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of
Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.
A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of
such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

206


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by
clauses (4) and (7) of the second paragraph of this section “Amendments and Waivers” to add a Guarantor under the
Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional
Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any
other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer, the Trustee and
the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

The Indenture shall not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes Documents
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including
those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the
obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security
Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations and the obligations of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described_
under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration
provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuer), the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provision and the security default provisions described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant
_defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance
option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified
in clause (3) (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (with respect
only to a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) of the Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee cash in Euro or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided, that upon
any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for
purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the
“Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the
deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward
such redemption, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders, and
beneficial owners of the Notes, in their capacity as Holders, will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only,
such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating
to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

207


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further effect
(except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in
the Indenture) as to all Notes when (a) either (i) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain
lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter
the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (ii) all Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (A) have become due and payable, (B) will become due and
payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (C) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at
the expense, of the Issuer; (b) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in Euro or
European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge
the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal,
premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the
Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture; (d) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to
apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be;
and (e) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all
conditions precedent under this “Satisfaction and Discharge” section relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of
fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d)). If requested in writing by the Issuer, the
Trustee shall distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case
may be; provided, however, that Holders have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such
earlier repayment date. For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to holders prior to the maturity or
redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break cost or any
other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a
Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC
that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Trustees Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent
Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such
claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (a) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (b) that if the
Trustee at any time (i) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (ii) becomes incapable of acting as
Trustee or (iii) becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a
_bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a_
successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

208


-----

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules
of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Notes are
represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of
this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any
notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means
and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or
communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a
notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to
Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims
against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the
applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any,
under or in connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount received or
recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of
any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the
Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to
the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with
the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a
result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis
against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima
_facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to_
the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These
indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will
give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder or
the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any
other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Notes
Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
Euro -denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non- Euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non- Euro
amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

209


-----

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be granted
to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes
on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and
settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the
payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price
with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, the
Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States. The Indenture will
provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding
with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court
located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the
Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The Security Documents will be governed by the
law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.

disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in
Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Relevant Testing Period. If since the

consolidation or disposed, ceased or discontinued operations had occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing
Period.

disposition or ceased or discontinued operations, as though such cost savings, expense reduction and synergies had been

rate in effect on the determination date had been the applicable rate for the entire Relevant Testing Period or (y) using
the average rate in effect over the Relevant Testing Period, in each case taking into account any Hedging Obligations
applicable to such Indebtedness. Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in
such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred to above,
interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based
upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the Relevant Testing Period except to the extent such
revolving credit facility has been permanently repaid and the commitments thereunder cancelled. Interest on
Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a

other Person (whether arising by virtue of partnership arrangements, or by agreements to keep-well, to
purchase assets, goods, securities or services, to take-or-pay or to maintain financial statement conditions
or otherwise); or

_provided, however, that the term “Guarantee” will not include (x) endorsements for collection or deposit in the ordinary_
course of business or consistent with past practice and (y) standard contractual indemnities or product warranties
provided in the ordinary course of business, and provided further that the amount of any Guarantee shall be deemed to
be the lower of (i) an amount equal to the stated or determinable amount of the primary obligation in respect of which
such Guarantee is made and (ii) the maximum amount for which such guaranteeing Person may be liable pursuant to the
terms of the instrument embodying such Guarantee or, if such Guarantee is not an unconditional guarantee of the entire
amount of the primary obligation and such maximum amount is not stated or determinable, the amount of such
guaranteeing Person’s maximum reasonably anticipated liability in respect thereof as determined by such Person in good

under the caption “Reports,” as in effect from time to time. Except as otherwise set forth in the Indenture, all ratios and

made by the Issuer. The Issuer shall give notice of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the
Trustee and the Holders. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the impact of IFRS 16 (Leases) and any successor
standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under GAAP) shall be disregarded with respect to all ratios, calculations and
determinations based upon IFRS to be calculated or made, as the case may be, pursuant to the Indenture and (without
limitation) any lease, concession or license of property that would be considered an operating lease under IFRS (or, as

Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global
Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Fixed Rate Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Fixed Rate
Rule 144A Global Note, the “Fixed Rate Global Notes”) and the Regulation S Global Note representing the Floating
Rate Notes (the “Floating Rate Regulations S Global Note” and, together with the Floating Rate Rule 144A Global Note,
the “Floating Rate Global Notes”) will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or
Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the
Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the
books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests
will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will
be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Book-Entry
Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead Euroclear and Clearstream will credit a participant’s account on their
book entry transfer and registration systems with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or
pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be
considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In
addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on
the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to
transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent, the Calculation
Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the
records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following circumstances:

(i) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(ii) the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an “Event of Default” under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (ii), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to
be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made
the initial request.

251


-----

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued
in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable (in
accordance with its respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the
beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as
provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, any Transfer Agent, Calculation Agent
and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to
the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of
15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for
redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. The Issuer is also not
required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and
not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer. In the event of the transfer
of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. The Issuer may require a holder to pay any transfer
taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered Note has
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the
Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or an authentication agent appointed by
it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The
Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an
indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Registrar or the Paying Agent appointed
pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The
Issuer, Registrar and Trustee may charge for any expenses incurred by it in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due
and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer,
in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers to the
Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by
them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption
of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the
existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear
and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent
fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry
Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear
and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to participants’ accounts in accordance with their customary
procedures. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

252


-----

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation
Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., the
common depositary (or its respective nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation
Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

     - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made
on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

     - any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant (including payments made); or

     - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of (i) the Fixed Rate
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro and (ii) the
Floating Rate Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the Paying Agent,
the Calculation Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any
currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign
exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of a
Note (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more
participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of
any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the relevant Notes,
Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for
Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Note requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require the physical delivery
of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in
accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any other exemption (if
available under the Securities Act).

253


-----

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified
institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or
otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with
any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S
Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers
to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) no Book-Entry Interest in any Fixed Rate Global Note and no Definitive
Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Fixed Rate Global Notes may be transferred or
exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Floating Rate Global Note or any Definitive Registered Note issued in
exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Floating Rate Global Notes (the “Definitive Registered Floating Rate Notes”),
and (ii) no Book-Entry Interest in the Floating Rate Global Notes and no Definitive Registered Floating Rate Note may
be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Fixed Rate Global Note or any Definitive Registered
Fixed Rate Note (the “Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Notes”).

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global
Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Pledges**

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Book-Entry Interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require
that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests to such person may be limited.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of
investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be
changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar nor any of the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between
their participants through electronic book entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending
and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who or that in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons
or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect

254


-----

of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or
Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business. In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States. United States investors who or
that wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular
day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Brussels, if Euroclear is used, or
in Luxembourg, if Clearstream is used.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the
ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or
continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Calculation Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. BookEntry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business
day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in same day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any BookEntry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on
the desired value date.

255


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor as to the possible tax consequences of
purchasing, holding or selling any Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile, including
the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a comprehensive
description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell Notes. In particular, these
discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to you. The discussions that follow for
each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as in effect as of the date of this offering
memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

**Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

The following information is of a general nature only and is based on the laws presently in force in Luxembourg,
though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. Prospective investors in the Notes
should therefore consult their own professional advisers as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including
Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg
income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy, impost or other charge or
withholding of a similar nature, or to any other concepts, refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Also,
please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des
_collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour_
_l’emploi) as well as personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu) generally. Investors may further be subject to net wealth_
tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income taxes, municipal business tax, as well
as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes.
Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain
circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business
undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Taxation of the Holders of Notes_**

_Withholding Tax_

Non-Resident Holders of Notes

Under Luxembourg general tax laws, there is no Luxembourg withholding tax for non-resident corporations
holders of the Notes on payments of at-arm’s-length interest (including accrued but unpaid interest), except for interest
on certain profit sharing bonds or similar instruments and interest paid as a profit share under certain silent partnership
type arrangements or payments on instruments that are deemed to be equity from a tax perspective, in which case a 15%
withholding tax is currently levied at source, unless on the basis of the tax treaty concluded with Luxembourg and the
country in which the corporation is tax resident, a lower tax rate or an exemption is available.

Resident Holders of Notes

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the law of December 23, 2005, as amended
(the “Relibi Law”), there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to Luxembourg
resident holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax
payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg resident holders of Notes.

Under the Relibi Law, payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in
Luxembourg to an individual beneficial owner who is a resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding tax of
20%. Such withholding tax will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the
course of the management of his/her private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding of the tax will be assumed by the
Luxembourg paying agent. Payment of interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the Relibi Law will be
subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 20%.

_Income Taxation_

Non-Resident Holders of Notes

A non-resident holder of Notes, not having a permanent establishment or permanent representative in
Luxembourg to which/whom such Notes are attributable, is not subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or

256


-----

received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes. A gain realized by such non-resident holder of
Notes on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes is further not subject to Luxembourg income tax.

A non-resident corporate holder of Notes or an individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the management
of a professional or business undertaking, who has a permanent establishment or permanent representative in
Luxembourg to which or to whom such Notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued
or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes and on any gains realized upon the sale or
disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

Resident Holders of Notes

Luxembourg Resident Corporate Holder of Notes:

A corporate holder of Notes must include any interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue
discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its taxable income
for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.

A corporate holder of Notes that is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 on family estate management
companies, as amended, or by the law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as amended, by
the law of February 13, 2007 on specialized investment funds, as amended, or by the law of July 23, 2016 on reserved
alternative investment funds and which does not fall under the special tax regime set out in article 48 thereof is neither
subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount,
nor on gains realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

Luxembourg Resident Individual Holder of Notes:

An individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject to
Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts,
under the Notes, except if (i) withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with the Relibi Law, or
(ii) the individual holder of the Notes has opted for the application of a 20% tax in full discharge of income tax in
accordance with the Relibi Law, which applies if a payment of interest has been made or ascribed by a paying agent
established in a EU Member State (other than Luxembourg), or in a Member State of the European Economic Area
(other than a EU Member State). A gain realized by an individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the
management of his/her private wealth, upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of Notes is not subject to
Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal took place more than six months after the Notes were acquired.
However, any portion of such gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income is subject to Luxembourg
income tax, except if tax has been levied on such interest in accordance with the Relibi Law.

An individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking
must include this interest in its taxable basis. If applicable, the tax levied in accordance with the Relibi Law will be
credited against his/her final tax liability.

**_Net Wealth Taxation_**

A corporate holder of Notes, whether it is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes or, if not, it maintains a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which/whom such Notes are attributable, is
subject to Luxembourg wealth tax on such Notes, except if the holder of Notes is governed by the law of May 11, 2007
on family estate management companies, as amended, by the law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective
investment, as amended, by the law of February 13, 2007 on specialized investment funds, as amended, by the law of
July 23, 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds, or is a securitization company governed by the law of March 22,
2004 on securitization, as amended, or is a capital company governed by the law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital
vehicles, as amended. Please however note that securitization companies governed by the law of March 22, 2004 on
securitization, as amended, or capital companies governed by the law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles, as
amended, or reserved alternative investment funds governed by the law of July 23, 2016 and which fall under the special
tax regime set out under article 48 thereof may, under certain conditions, be subject to minimum net wealth tax.

An individual holder of Notes, whether he/she is a resident of Luxembourg or not, is not subject to Luxembourg
wealth tax on such Notes.

**_Other Taxes_**

In principle, neither the issuance nor the transfer, repurchase or redemption of Notes will give rise to any
Luxembourg registration tax or similar taxes.

257


-----

However, a fixed or ad valorem registration duty may be due upon the registration of the Notes in Luxembourg
in the case where the notes are physically attached to a public deed or to any other document subject to mandatory
registration, in the case of a registration of the Notes on a voluntary basis or in case the Notes are lodged with a
Luxembourg Civil Law notary for his records (déposé au rang des minutes d’un notaire).

Where a holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the Notes are
included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of Notes if embodied in a Luxembourg deed passed in front of a
Luxembourg notary or recorded in Luxembourg.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of Notes as of the date hereof. Except for the discussion under “—Backup Withholding and Information
_Reporting—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” this summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets by_
a United States holder (as defined below) who acquires our Notes upon original issuance at their respective issue price
(the first price at which a substantial amount of the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, is sold to
the investors for cash (excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity
of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler)).

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is for United States federal income tax
purposes any of the following:

     - an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

     - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

     - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

     - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid
election in effect under applicable United States Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) to be
treated as a United States person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed,
perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below.
This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxes and does not address the effects of the
Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or foreign, state, or local or other tax considerations that may be
relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description
of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the U.S.
federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address tax consequences to:

     - holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities or currencies, traders in
securities that elect to use the mark to market method of accounting for their securities, financial
institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, investors in partnerships or other
pass through entities for United States federal income tax purposes, tax exempt entities or insurance
companies;

     - persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion transaction or a
straddle;

     - U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

     - United States expatriates or entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules;

     - persons who actually or constructively own more than 5% of our voting stock;

     - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes being
taken into account in an applicable financial statement;

258


-----

     - persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax; or

     - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our Notes, the tax treatment of a
partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership,
or a partner of a partnership, holding our Notes, you should consult your tax advisors.

If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular
United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as well as
the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments on the
Notes (as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) or make additional payments in redemption
of the Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest (as described under “Description of the
_Notes—Change of Control”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility_
of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of the Notes, does not result in the
Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position
will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional
amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury
Regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. holder, unless
the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) on its tax return for the year during
which such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on
the IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest
income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is
the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and
conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other
taxable disposition of the Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. holder should consult
its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments.
The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Interest_**

It is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be issued with original issue discount for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such a case, subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount
of interest on a Note (which includes any foreign tax withheld) will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the
time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes. In addition to interest on the
Notes, you will be required to include in income any Additional Amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld.
You may be entitled to deduct or credit this tax, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or
credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including
any Additional Amounts) generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States
foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax
credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement
during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are
urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.

If you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to
include in income the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest received, determined by translating the euro received at the
spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange
gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received.

If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount
of income recognized with respect to such stated interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first
method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that
has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or

259


-----

periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S.
holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest
income at the spot rate on:

     - the last day of the accrual period;

     - the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period
straddles your taxable year; or

     - the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the
accrual period.

This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Note (including, upon the
sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously
included in income), you will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate on the date
such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income you previously included in income with
respect to such payment. This exchange gain or loss will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement and Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, you will recognize gain
or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest
income to the extent not previously included in income) and your adjusted tax basis in the Note. Your adjusted tax basis
in a Note generally will be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. If you purchased your Note with euro, your cost generally
will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If
your Note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euro, the amount
realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash method taxpayer and the Notes are
traded on an established securities market, euro paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the
settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the
purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently
to all debt instruments from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and
will be long term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition,
you have held the Note for more than one year. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals,
derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note would generally be treated as United States source gain or loss.

A portion of your gain or loss may be treated as exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a
Note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or
loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in euro on the
date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S.
dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date you
purchased the Note. The amount of exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on
the disposition of the Note.

**_Exchange Gain or Loss with Respect to Euro_**

Your tax basis in the euro received as interest on a Note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot rate in
effect on the date the euro are received. Your tax basis in euro received on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a Note will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro, determined at the time of the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. As discussed above, if the Notes are traded on an

260


-----

established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (or, upon election, an accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine the
U.S. dollar value of the euro by translating the euro received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the
sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. Accordingly, your basis in the euro received would
be equal to the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date. If you purchase a Note with previously owned euro, you will
generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between your adjusted tax basis in such
euro and the U.S. dollar fair market value of such Note on the date of purchase.

Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of
the euro will be ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss. The conversion of U.S.
dollars to euro and the immediate use of such euro to purchase a Note generally will not result in any exchange gain or
loss for a U.S. holder.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Treasury Regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to
cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the
applicable Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS including, in certain
circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note, or foreign currency
received in respect of a foreign currency note, to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. Holders considering the purchase of Notes should
consult with their own tax advisor to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the
Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Individuals and certain entities who or that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value
exceeding certain threshold amounts, generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with
their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting
requirements, unless the Notes are held in a financial account at certain financial institutions.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of principal and interest on a Note, or
the proceeds from the sale of a Note, unless you are an exempt recipient. Additionally, if you fail to provide your
taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments fail either to report in full dividend and interest
income or to make certain certifications, you may be subject to backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability, provided the required information
is timely furnished to the IRS.

Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain
exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions), by attaching
a complete IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets), with their tax return for each year in
which they hold an interest in the Notes. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding backup withholding
and information reporting requirements relating to your ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a “foreign
financial institution” may be required to withhold United States tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” made after
December 31, 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain United States source payments.
Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations
defining “foreign passthru payments” are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially
modified after such date. As of the date of this offering memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet
been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the
Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes after the
expiration of this grandfathering period. Non United States governments (including the government of The Netherlands)
have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to
implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors
on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed
with respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the
withheld amount.

**Certain General Tax Considerations—Payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be subject to
withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable
double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption that may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor
will be eligible for such exemptions.

262


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Guarantors, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, Danske Bank A/S, DNB Markets, a
division of DNB Bank ASA and Nykredit Bank A/S, as Initial Purchasers, have entered into a purchase agreement dated
on or around the date of this offering memorandum with respect to the Notes (the “Purchase Agreement”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial
Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase
Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue prices that appear on
the cover of this offering memorandum for each of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes. After the initial
Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the Offering’s price for each series of Notes and any other selling terms
without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or
through United States registered broker dealers.

In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:

     - the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Notes are subject to,
among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions by their counsel;

     - during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 60 days
after such date, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries or other affiliates will, without
the prior written consent of Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of any debt (including, without limitation, any debt securities, loans or other debt
instruments), issued or guaranteed by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors and having a tenor of more than
one year (other than the Notes); and

     - the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments
that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the
Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial
Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the
country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Certain affiliates of the Issuer may
purchase a portion of the Notes in the Offering.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Notes may not be offered or sold
within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in
transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an
offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or
another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. During this 40 day period, neither Clearstream nor
Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act. In addition, as Nykredit Bank
A/S and its affiliated are not registered with the SEC as a U.S. registered broker-dealer, it will effect offers and sales of
the Notes solely outside of the United States.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In
addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”
We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the Official List of the
Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that
they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue
any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market making activities will be

263


-----

subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable legal requirements.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell
your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and
syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short
position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the
purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of
the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing
transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be
in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions,
they may discontinue them at any time.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the
Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next successive
business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade
the Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own advisor.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

     - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done
by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and

     - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in
which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and
will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this
provision the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client as
defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in the Prospectus Directive.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of
this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this
purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering
memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or
published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any
such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this
offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the
Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of Notes. See “Notice to Certain Investors.”

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will
perform, banking, investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for the Issuer and its affiliates,
for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and reimbursement of expenses. In particular,
Danske Bank A/S currently provides transaction banking, cash management, trade finance and leasing services to certain
Group companies, namely Stark Danmark A/S, DT Finland Oy, Neumann Bygg AS and Beijer Byggmaterial
Aktiebolag. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the

264


-----

Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would
hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of the Issuer, the
Group, such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short
positions in such securities and instruments.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

The following is a general discussion of the insolvency laws of several jurisdictions for informational purposes
only and does not address all the legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes.

**European Union**

The Issuer and the Guarantors located in Denmark, Sweden and Finland are incorporated under the laws of
Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European
Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that
term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency
proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its “centre of main interests” is a question
of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has
its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the
three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the
EU Insolvency Regulation states that the centre of main interests “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into
consideration a number of factors in determining the centre of main interests of a debtor, including, in particular, where
board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the
location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. Recital 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states
that the presumption should be rebutted where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other
than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a
manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the
management of its interests is located in that other Member State. A debtor’s centre of main interests is not a static
concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent
jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If the centre of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be
commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of
insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in
one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than
Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If the centre of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence
territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State.
An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the threemonth period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human
means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another EU Member
State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three month period prior to
the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such
other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests
have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State
where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member
State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under of the conditions laid down by that Member State’s
law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is
in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening
of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the
territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings.

266


-----

Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings
will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that
has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States (other than Denmark) so long as no
secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member
State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s centre of main interests is there) may
exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets
of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have
been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a
request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. The EU
Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement
of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective
administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

**Luxembourg**

The insolvency laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to holders of Notes as
insolvency laws of other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. The Issuer is incorporated and has its centre
of main interests (centre des intérêts principaux), for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation and central
administration (administration centrale) in Luxembourg. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings affecting the Issuer
would be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of the key features of
Luxembourg insolvency proceedings and certain aspects of insolvency laws in the Luxembourg as they may apply in
respect of the Issuer.

**_Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings_**

Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as “Insolvency
Proceedings”) may be opened against the Issuer to the extent that it its centre of main interests (centre des intérêts
_principaux), for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation, and central administration (administration centrale) in_
Luxembourg:

     - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite);

     - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée); and

     - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite).

In addition to these Insolvency Proceedings, the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive payment on the
Notes may be affected by a decision of the Commercial District Court (Tribunal d’arrondissement siégeant en matière
_commerciale) granting suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) or putting the Issuer into judicial liquidation_
(liquidation judiciaire).

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings (Faillite)_**

_General Administration of Bankruptcy Proceedings_

The opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be requested by the Issuer or by any of its creditors. Following such
a request, the Commercial District Court having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings in the event that the
Issuer (a) has ceased to make payments (cessation de paiements) and (b) has lost its commercial creditworthiness
(ébranlement de crédit). If the Commercial District Court considers that these conditions are met, it may open
bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion, absent a request made by the Issuer or a creditor.

If the Commercial District Court declares a company bankrupt, it will appoint one or more bankruptcy receivers
(curateur(s)), depending on the complexity of the proceedings and a supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to supervise
the bankruptcy proceedings.

The period within which creditors must file their proof of claims (déclaration de créance) is specified in the
judgment adjudicating the company bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may nevertheless be taken into account by
the bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to distributable proceeds.

267


-----

The bankruptcy receiver takes over the management and control of the Issuer in place of the managers. The
bankruptcy receiver will realize the Issuer’s assets and distribute the proceeds to the Issuer’s creditors in accordance
with the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds left, to the bankrupt company’s shareholders. The
bankruptcy receiver represents the Issuer as well as the creditors collectively (masse des créanciers).

The bankruptcy receiver will need to obtain of the Commercial District Court permission for certain acts, such as
agreeing to a settlement of claims or deciding to pursue the business of the Issuer during the bankruptcy proceedings.

Bankruptcy is governed by public policy and rules, which generally delay the process and limit restructuring
options of the group to which the bankrupt company belongs.

On closing of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company will normally be dissolved.

**_Effects of Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Issuer,
except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors, and the payment of unsecured creditors of the Issuer
in accordance with their rank upon the realization of the assets of the Issuer.

In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement of
bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial (intuitu
_personae agreements) for the other party. However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by law, such as_
employment contracts, unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. Contractual provisions purporting to terminate a
contract upon bankruptcy are generally held as being valid. The receiver may choose to terminate contracts of the
company subject to the rule of “exceptio non adimpleti contractus” and the creditors’ interest.

Unsecured claims of the Issuer (such as the Issuer’s liabilities under the Notes) will, in the event of a liquidation
of the Issuer, only rank after (i) the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation)
and (ii) the debts of the Issuer that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg
law include, inter alia:

     - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

     - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

     - social security contributions; and

     - remuneration owed to employees.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured creditors of the Issuer (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized and subject to
application of the relevant priority rules, liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law). During insolvency
proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors of the Issuer are suspended.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the
pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is fixed by the Luxembourg court and dates back not more
than six months as from the date on which the Luxembourg court formally adjudicates a company bankrupt, and, as for
specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period. In
particular:

     - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some transactions (in particular, the granting
of a security interest for antecedent debts, save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the
meaning of the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Collateral
Act 2005”)), the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means
other than in cash or by bill of exchange (unless, arguably, that method of payment was agreed from
inception), transactions without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration entered into
during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside, if so requested by the bankruptcy
receiver;

268


-----

     - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as
other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to setting aside by the
Commercial District Court upon proceedings initiated by the bankruptcy receiver, if they were concluded
with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; and

     - pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code
(action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any
fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made
prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

**_Controlled Management Proceedings (Gestion Contrôlée)_**

_General Administration of Controlled Management Proceedings_

The Issuer, which has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) or which is not in a position
to completely fulfil its obligations, can apply for the regime of controlled management in order either (i) to restructure
its business or (ii) to realize its assets in good conditions. An application for controlled management can only be made
by the Issuer.

The loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) is identical to the credit test applied in
bankruptcy proceedings. As to the second criteria (that is, the case where a company is not in a position to completely
fulfil its obligations), a broad view of the total situation of the Issuer is taken. Controlled management proceedings is
only available for good-faith debtor.

Controlled management proceedings are rarely used as they are not often successful and generally lead to
bankruptcy proceedings. They are occasionally applied to companies, in particular holding or finance companies, which
are part of an international group and whose inability to meet obligations results from a default of group companies.

The proceedings are divided into three steps:

(i) The Issuer must file an application with the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court
can reject the application because (i) the Issuer has already been declared bankrupt or (ii) the evidence
brought forward by the Issuer does not ensure the stabilization and the normal exercise of the Issuer’s
business or improve the realization of the Issuer’s assets in better conditions. If the application is upheld
at this stage, the Commercial District Court will appoint an investigating judge (juge délégué) to make a
report on the overall situation of the Issuer.

(ii) Once the investigating judge has delivered a report, the Commercial District Court may (i) turn down the
application on the ground that the proposals made by the applicant are unlikely to lead to the
reorganization of the business or the realization of the assets in better conditions or (ii) appoint one or
more administrators (commissaires) who will supervise the management of the assets of the Issuer. If the
Commercial District Court ascertains that the Issuer is unable to pay its creditors (i.e. the Issuer has
ceased its paiements (cessation de paiements)), it may set the date as from which the Issuer will be
deemed to have been in such situation. Such date may be set up to six months prior to the filing of
application for controlled management proceedings. However, bankruptcy may only be declared if the
two conditions for bankruptcy are met (cessation of payment (cessation de paiements) and loss of
commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit)), and if the application has been dismissed either
before or after consideration of the report by the investigating judge or after the reorganization plan
proposed by the administrators (commissaires) at the third step described below. The administrators will
draw up the inventory of the assets as well as the financial situation of the Issuer. They are also in charge
of the annual accounts of the Issuer. The administrators may also prescribe any act they consider to be in
the interests of the applicant or its creditors. The administrators have to be convened to any meeting of
the board of directors or of managers. They may attend all board meetings but have no voting rights. They
have the right to convene such board meetings.

(iii) The administrators will draft a reorganization plan in respect of the applicant’s business or a plan for
realization of the assets, within the deadlines set forth by the Commercial District Court. The plan shall
equitably take into account all interests involved and will comply with the ranking of mortgages
(hypothèques) and privileges (privilèges) as required by law, without taking into account any contractual
clause regarding termination, penalties or acceleration. The administrators will notify the draft plan to the

269


-----

creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. Within fifteen days of such notification or publication, the
creditors will inform the Commercial District Court whether they agree or object to the draft plan. Any
creditor who abstains will be considered as having adhered to the plan. The creditors, the company, the
joint debtors and the guarantors may submit written observations to the Commercial District Court. The
Commercial District Court may (i) approve the plan if a majority of the creditors representing, via their
claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the Issuer’s liabilities have
agreed thereto or (ii) disagree with the plan proposed by the administrators even though a majority of the
creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half
of the company’s liabilities have agreed to such plan, in which case the application for controlled
management will be dismissed or (iii) ask the administrators to propose an amended plan (such amended
plan will have to be submitted again to the creditors). The judgment approving the plan will be binding
upon the company and its creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. The fees of the administrators will be
fixed by the Commercial District Court and will be borne by the company. The administrators who at the
same time are creditors of the applicant are not entitled to any fees.

_Effects of A Controlled Management Proceedings_

As from the day of the appointment of the investigating judge and up to the final decision on the application for
controlled management, any subsequent enforcement proceedings or acts, even if initiated by privileged creditors
(including creditors who have the benefit of pledges (gages) and mortgages (hypothèques)) are stayed, save as provided
for by the Collateral Act 2005. The Issuer may not enter into any act of disposition, mortgage and contract or accept any
movable asset without the authorization of the investigating judge.

Once the administrators have been appointed, the Issuer may not carry out any act (including receiving funds,
lending money, granting any security, or making any payment) without the prior authorization of the administrators. The
administrators may bring any action before the Commercial District Court in order to have any act made in violation of
the legislation governing the controlled management or in fraud of the creditors’ rights be set aside. Subject to the prior
authorization of the Commercial District Court, they may bring an action (i) to have the directors, managers or the
statutory auditor be held liable or (ii) if the Commercial District Court has declared the company to be in cessation of
payments, to have certain payments, compensations or security interests be set aside (under certain conditions set forth
in Articles 445 et seq. of the Luxembourg code of commerce).

**_Preventive Composition Proceedings (Concordat Préventif De La Faillite)_**

_General Administration of Preventive Composition Proceedings_

The Issuer may enter into a preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite) in order to
resolve its financial difficulties by entering into an agreement with its creditors, the purpose of which is to avoid
bankruptcy.

Preventive composition proceedings may only be applied for by a company which is in financial difficulty.
Similar to controlled management proceedings, the preventive composition proceedings are not available if the company
has already been declared bankrupt by the Commercial District Court or if the company is acting in bad faith. The
application for the preventive composition proceedings can only be made by the Issuer and must be supported by
proposals of preventive composition.

The Commercial District Court will delegate to a delegated judge (juge délégué) the duty to verify, and to
prepare a report on, the situation of the Issuer. Based on such report, the Commercial District Court will decide whether
or not to pursue the preventive composition proceedings. If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure
should not be pursued, it will in the same judgment declare the bankruptcy of the company (which bankruptcy may also
be declared during the preventive composition proceedings if the conditions for the composition proceedings are not
met). If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure may be pursued, it will set the place, date and hour
of a meeting (assemblée concordataire) at which the creditors will be convened. The delegated judge will make its
report at the assemblée concordataire.

The preventive composition may only be adopted if a majority of the creditors representing, by their
unchallenged claims, three-quarters of the Issuer’s debt, has adhered to the proposal and if the preventive composition
has been homologated by the Commercial District Court. Creditors benefiting from mortgages (hypothèques), privileges
(privilèges) or pledges (gages) only have a deliberating voice in the operations of the concordat, if they renounce the
benefit of their mortgages, privileges or pledges. The vote in favor of the concordat entails renunciation. The
renunciation may be limited by the secured creditors to only a portion (but representing at least 50% in value) of their
claims with corresponding voting rights.

270


-----

The preventive composition has no effect on the claims secured by a mortgage, a privilege or a pledge and on
claims by the tax authorities. If the application results in a preventive composition arrangement sanctioned by the
Commercial District Court, the preventive composition could still either be annulled (if it has not been executed) or
terminated (in case of fraud or bad faith of the company). In such scenarios, the Commercial District Court may
adjudicate bankrupt the Issuer. The bankruptcy judgment can decide to set the date of cessation of payment to the date of
the application for the preventive composition proceedings. If that date is less than six months prior to the bankruptcy
judgment, the court can of course set the cessation of payment date at six months prior to its judgment.

Preventive composition proceedings are rarely used in practice since they are not binding upon secured creditors.

_Effects of a Preventive Composition Proceedings_

The Issuer’s business activities continue during the preventive composition proceedings. While the preventive
composition is being negotiated, the Issuer may not dispose of, or grant any security over, any assets without the
approval of the delegated judge. Once the preventive composition has been agreed by the Commercial District Court,
this restriction is lifted. However, the Issuer’s business activities will still be supervised by the delegated judge.

Except as provided for in Collateral Act 2005, while the preventive composition is being negotiated, unsecured
creditors may not take action against the company to recover their claims. Secured creditors who do not participate in the
preventive composition proceedings may take action against the Issuer to recover their claims and to enforce their
security. Fraudulent transactions which took place before the date on which the Commercial District Court commenced
preventive composition proceedings may be set aside (please see the bankruptcy proceedings section above).

**_Suspension of Payments Proceedings (Sursis De Paiements)_**

_General Administration of a Suspension of Payments Proceedings_

A suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) for commercial companies is different from the sursis de
_paiement proceedings available to banks and insurance companies. It can only be applied to a company which, as a result_
of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily cease its payments but which has on the basis of its
balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of payments may also be granted if
the situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious elements of reestablishment of the balance
between its assets and its debts.

The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking experiencing financial
difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding involving both the Commercial
District Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority of the creditors representing, by their
claims, three-quarters of the company’s debts (excluding claims secured by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque)
or pledge (gage)).

The suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons it has lost
its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed by the debtor prior to obtaining the
suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and other public charges or secured claims (by right of privilege,
a mortgage or a pledge) are concerned.

_Effects of Suspension of Payments Proceedings_

During the suspension of payments, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings against the Issuer or
the Issuer’s assets. This stay on enforcement does not extend to preferred creditors, or to creditors which are secured by
mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial collateral arrangements governed by the Collateral Act 2005. The
Issuer continues to manage its own business under the supervision of a court-appointed administrator who must approve
most of the transactions carried out by the Issuer.

When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the Issuer’s managers can run
the business again.

**_Judicial Liquidation_**

Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies
pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the
Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the Companies Act 1915).

271


-----

The management of such judicial liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable
to bankruptcy proceedings.

**_Security Interests Considerations_**

According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae
or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the security interests (such as a pledge) are
situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets.

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of pledges
over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies,
preferred equity certificates in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims
governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg,
securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in
Luxembourg, etc.

The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares (such
as registered shares in Luxembourg companies), preferred equity certificates, bank accounts and receivables located or
deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of pledges depends on certain
registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge over registered shares in a Luxembourg company
must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the pledge) and/or
(ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge
will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge under a receivables pledge
agreement will be validly created and perfected provided that the pledge under such receivables pledge agreement is
executed by the parties thereto. However, if the debtor has not been notified of such receivables pledge or if it did not
otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, it will be validly discharged of its obligations if it pays the pledgor. A bank
account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has
waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts
are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required. Article 11 of
the Collateral Act 2005 sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including,
but not limited to:

     - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at a value determined in
accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties;

     - sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (if listed shares) or (iii) by
way of a public auction;

     - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

     - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen,
(ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties,
such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the pledges might be substantially delayed.

The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges and transfer
of title by way of security) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during the
hardening period, against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or
bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or
reorganization affecting any one of the parties.

The perfection of the pledges created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor
from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the
pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets
of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to
priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law).

272


-----

Foreign law governed security interests (such as the escrow charge) and the powers of any receivers/
administrators may not be enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg.
Security interests/ arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any
receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside
of Luxembourg, in particular where the relevant Luxembourg security provider or Luxembourg guarantor becomes
subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of
the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if ‘main insolvency proceedings’ (as defined in the
EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights
_in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies in accordance with_
article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Finally, the appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent
that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending
on the type of security interests. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Collateral Act 2005, a financial collateral
may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral takers, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the
claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined
or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third-party beneficiaries of such financial
collateral, persons acting on behalf of the third-party beneficiaries of a financial collateral, the fiduciary or the trustee
benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of a financial collateral under the Collateral Act 2005.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the transaction documents with the Administration de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines in
Luxembourg may be required in the case of legal proceedings before Luxembourg courts or in the case that they must be
produced before an official Luxembourg authority (autorité constituée).

In such case, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of the amount of
the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be payable depending on the nature of the
document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of security interest agreements which are subject to
the Collateral Act 2005.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the transaction documents and any
judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

**Denmark**

**_Insolvency Proceedings Under Danish Law_**

Any insolvency proceedings with respect to any Danish Notes Guarantor may proceed under, and be governed
by, the insolvency laws of Denmark as the EU Insolvency Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on
insolvency proceedings) does not apply to Denmark.

In a Danish bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors based
on a priority of claims. Such liquidation may not yield the same value to the creditors as a reorganization and sale of a
going concern.

As a general rule, the debtor or (provided it has the necessary legal interest) any creditor may present a petition
for bankruptcy. A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied that the debtor is insolvent based on a
statement of the debtor’s liquidity status and that the insolvency is not of a purely temporary nature. A bankruptcy
petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the event of the debtor’s insolvency by means of
good and valid security. If there is probable cause for the creditor to believe that avoidable transactions have occurred, it
may serve as required legal interest, provided that the creditor is able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with a
certain degree of certainty.

If bankruptcy proceedings are commenced, payments under the Notes may be delayed and may not be made in
full. Provisions on avoidance and set off may adversely affect the enforcement of rights under the Notes. Security
interests (except for those qualified as “håndpant eller anden tilsvarende sikkerhedsret” under the Danish Bankruptcy
Act (Konkursloven)) may only be enforced by the bankruptcy trustee, however, mortgagees and execution creditors may
demand enforcement of such security interests six months after the declaration of bankruptcy, always provided that such
security interests are valid and duly perfected.

273


-----

Danish insolvency law also includes a scheme for reconstruction of insolvent companies. In broad terms, this
scheme provides for reconstruction of an insolvent company by transfer of the business in full or in part and/or a
compulsory composition/moratorium. During the reconstruction procedure, creditors are restricted in their ability to
enforce their claims; however valid security may be enforced under certain conditions (including security interests that
are qualified as “håndpant eller anden tilsvarende sikkerhedsret” under the Danish Bankruptcy Act (Konkursloven)). If a
restructuring procedure fails, bankruptcy proceedings will be initiated against the debtor.

The Danish bankruptcy scheme is based on the fundamental principle of pari passu satisfaction of the debtor’s
unsecured creditors. However, claims against the debtor are subject to priority ranking, giving first priority to costs
incurred during the bankruptcy proceedings or claims according to agreements affirmed by the bankruptcy trustee,
including the fee for the bankruptcy trustee. Second rank is given to claims incurred during any preceding restructuring
proceedings and other costs incurred with the approval of any reconstructor. Third rank, “privileged claims,” are mainly
certain salary claims, including holiday pay, salary income taxes (relating to salary claims being filed) and salary claims
payable in the period of six months of the onset of insolvency but excluding salary claims from management. Fourth
rank is given to suppliers to the debtor who have, within twelve months of the onset of insolvency, delivered goods to
the debtor with the applicable duties paid (or to be paid) by the relevant supplier, but only (i) as regards certain
specifically listed duties, and (ii) to the extent that the relevant supplier has a claim for reimbursement of the duties
prepaid.

After fulfilment, if any, of these priority ranking claims, in the above order, any excess proceeds will be
distributed among all ordinary, unsecured and unsubordinated creditors. Interest accrued on ordinary, unsecured and
unsubordinated claims will rank as ordinary claims up to the date of the bankruptcy order, after which date the accrued
interest will rank as a deferred claim. Deferred claims also include, among others, certain liquidated damages,
subordinated loans and penalties.

In the event of bankruptcy, claims in foreign currencies will be converted into Danish krone using the relevant
currency rate as of the date of the bankruptcy order.

The status of a claim is dependent upon express statutory authority (except for subordinated loans).

**_Voidable Transactions_**

Danish bankruptcy law contains several provisions enabling the bankruptcy trustee to initiate proceedings to have
certain transactions prior to the bankruptcy avoided. Some avoidance provisions require the payment or security to be
granted within six or three months, as applicable, before the date of the bankruptcy (or the reconstruction) petition being
filed (referred to as “the reference date”). In some cases, however, avoidance can be claimed for payments or security
granted within two years or more before the date of the reference date.

Under Danish bankruptcy law, payments of debt made by a Danish group company could be void if such
payments are made (a) later than three months before the reference date (i) by unusual means of payment, (ii) before the
normal due date or (iii) in an amount that has a distinctly impairing effect on such Danish group company’s ability to
pay its debts, always provided such payment does not appear to be ordinary, and where such payment has been made for
the benefit of a party closely connected to such Danish group company, it may be void if the payment has been made
later than two years before the reference date, unless it is substantiated that such Danish group company neither was nor
became insolvent at the time of making the payment; or (b) after the reference date, unless such debts are settled under
the rules on the order of priority of creditors in bankruptcy, payment was necessary to prevent a loss or the persons for
whose benefit the payment was made neither knew nor ought to have known that a petition for bankruptcy (or
reconstruction) had been filed.

Granting of security could be void under Danish bankruptcy law if, among other things (i) security for the debts
was not granted to the creditor before or at the time the debt was incurred; or (ii) security was not perfected no later than
without undue delay after the time the debt was incurred, and where such security was made on behalf of a party closely
connected to such Danish group company, it may be void if the security has been granted later than two years before the
reference date, unless it is substantiated that such Danish group company neither was nor became insolvent at the time of
making the payment. The timing requirements in respect of granting of security and perfection are interpreted very
strictly under Danish law and “undue delay” in practice means as soon as practically possible.

A general avoidance rule applies under Danish bankruptcy law, pursuant to which any transaction, including
payments and security, which in an improper way favors a creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the
debtor’s assets are prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the debtor’s debts are

274


-----

increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be void if the Danish group company was (or by way of the transaction)
became insolvent and the party favored knew or ought to have known about the insolvency and the circumstances that
made the transaction improper. In general, only transactions which are contrary to common norms of correct and decent
business behavior will be deemed improper, and improper behavior is normally associated with breaching the purpose of
insolvency proceedings (e.g., when a creditor ought to realize that a given transaction will deprive the other creditors of
their right of satisfaction). Furthermore, there is no limitation in time applicable to this avoidance rule and it can in
principle be applied for an unlimited period of time.

Under Danish bankruptcy law the issuance of guarantees may be subject to avoidance if, among other things
(i) the issuance was made at a time when the issuer was insolvent, (ii) the issuance is without due consideration, and/or
(iii) between closely related parties. A claim for avoidance can be made against the main debtor or against the
beneficiary.

Any proceeds relating to a voidable claim are considered an asset of the bankruptcy estate and are to be
distributed to the creditors in accordance with the rules governing priority of debts in bankruptcy.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests_**

It is a requirement under Danish law that a guarantor or security provider obtains an adequate corporate benefit
from the issuance of a guarantee or granting of security. This is due to a requirement under Danish law that the
management of the company must always ensure a proper management of the company’s assets.

Further, the management of the company is obliged to act in accordance with the company’s individual interests,
including consideration of the company’s financial position, the benefits the company will obtain through and the risks
related to the granting of security or guarantee, assessment of the debtor, securing that the arrangement is on market
terms, etc. If such benefit is not obtained, the directors of a Danish guarantor or security provider may be subject to civil
liability and/or the guarantee or security may be null and void. It is not entirely clear under Danish case law to what
extent such corporate benefit is established when a subsidiary guarantees and secures debt of a direct or indirect parent
company.

The Danish Companies Act furthermore contains restrictions on financial assistance by Danish limited
companies.

Generally, a Danish company may not, directly or indirectly, advance or make funds available to, or grant loans
to, or issue guarantees or provide security for, any of its shareholders, or any of the shareholders in its, direct or indirect,
parent company or in any other company which exerts a decisive influence in respect of the Danish company.

However, Danish companies may advance or make funds available to, or grant loans to, or issue guarantees or
provide security for, Danish and certain foreign parent companies which are covered by Danish Executive Order
No. 275/2010 (on loans etc. to foreign parent companies) which includes any entity in the corporate form of (a) a public
limited company (aktieselskab), (b) a limited partnership with a share capital (partnerselskab), (c) a private limited
company (anpartsselskab) or (d) a foreign company with an equivalent corporate form, having its registered office in the
EU or EEA or any country categorized 0 or 1 in OECD’s country risk classification, including USA.

In addition to the general restriction on financial assistance, a Danish company is generally prohibited from
advancing or making funds available, granting loans, guarantees or security in connection with the financing or
refinancing of a third party’s acquisition of, or subscription for, shares in the Danish company or shares in the Danish
company’s direct or indirect parent company and any such loan, guarantee, security or other financial assistance will be
invalid and unenforceable.

To the extent that any such acquisition debt cannot be separated from other (non-acquisition) debt, such other
debt may be deemed acquisition debt and any loans, guarantees, security or other financial assistance provided by a
Danish company for such other debt may then also be invalid or unenforceable.

The prohibition on financial assistance also extends to non-Danish subsidiaries of Danish companies even if,
under the local financial assistance and other laws otherwise applicable to such non-Danish subsidiaries, the relevant
guarantee or security could validly be granted.

If loans, guarantees, security or other financial assistance are provided in violation of the prohibitions above,
such loans, guarantees, security or other financial assistance will be invalid and unenforceable and must be repaid
together with interests. The directors may be subject to fines and liability for losses suffered in this regard.

275


-----

**_Enforcement of Security Interests Outside Bankruptcy_**

The parties to a security agreement can include contractually agreed enforcement procedures and, if there are no
bankruptcy proceedings, the agreed procedures bind the parties. However, sales of assets may be voidable in a later
bankruptcy proceeding if the assets were transferred below market value.

The agreed enforcement procedures are not binding on third parties such as creditors that have registered an
attachment or valid security against the encumbered assets.

Such third-party attachments and rights can only be cleared through a court administered public auction.

In the absence of specifically agreed enforcement procedures, Danish law requires conduct of a public auction in
accordance with the Danish Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven).

Pledges of shares and accounts as well as security assignments of receivables may be enforced without an
execution order. However, at least eight days prior notice requesting the debtor to pay the secured debt must be given to
the pledgor by registered mail unless a sale is necessary to avoid or reduce a loss.

**_Perfection of Security Interests_**

The Collateral governed by Danish law will be granted and perfected, inter alia, in favor of the Security Agent as
representative for the holders of the Notes. Rules have been enacted in the Danish Capital Markets Act (lov om
_kapitalmarkeder) allowing representatives to hold security, and exercise authority and rights in relation thereto, on_
behalf of noteholders and the Security Agent may be appointed as representative pursuant to the Danish Capital Markets
Act (lov om kapitalmarkeder) and, in accordance therewith, should be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory
Authority (Finanstilsynet) to ensure effective representation. There is not yet any case law relating to this legislation
confirming the right of the representative to enforce on behalf of the holders of the Notes so there is a risk that
enforcement may be delayed.

The Collateral governed by Danish law will be perfected by the Issuer in favor of the Security Agent and some of
the Collateral may only be perfected after the occurrence of certain events of default or other perfection triggers.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may not be able to enforce its rights in the Collateral against
the security provider’s creditors, including a bankruptcy administrator who claim a security interest in the same
Collateral. The same principle applies with respect to any third party acting in good faith, provided that such third party
has complied with the relevant act of perfection. In general, Danish law stipulate (as an overall principle on perfection)
that a security provider must be deprived possession of control over the relevant assets that are subject to security and
such dispossession must be effective at all times. If dispossession is not effectively upheld, the security may be
extinguished.

A Danish court may find that a security interest in dividend rights and voting rights granted pursuant to a share
pledge agreement has not been perfected until the parties secured by the share pledge have given notice to the relevant
company that the voting rights and dividend rights pledged under the share pledge agreement may be exercised only by
the secured parties or a security agent acting on their behalf. Upon perfection, the security interest in dividend rights and
voting rights may be deemed to be security for pre-existing debt and, thus, as regards those rights be subject to a
hardening period and avoidance following perfection. The same principle applies to security interest over other assets,
e.g. bank account in respect of which the security provider is authorized to freely make withdrawals, release and transfer
funds and receivables (including subordinated claims) in respect of which the security provider is authorized to freely
receive payments, waive and amendment the terms and conditions thereof and exercise rights in respect of thereof.

A Danish court may find that security of receivables must be perfected in accordance with the law of the country
where that receivable is deemed to be located (the lex rei sitae rule). It is unresolved under Danish law if a receivable is
deemed to be located at the domicile of the debtor of the creditor, thus it cannot be ruled out that security over
receivables in respect of which a Danish company is a debtor or a creditor will be subject to Danish perfection
requirement notwithstanding that the governing law of the receivable between the parties thereto is not Danish law (and
vice versa).

Under Danish law, the ranking of security rights is determined by the date on which the relevant act of perfection
has been taken, and if a security interest created later in time over that same Collateral, but in respect of which the act of
perfection is completed prior to perfection of the pre-existing security interest then the security interest created later will
have priority (provided that the third party beneficiary, other than creditors, acts in good faith).

**_Parallel Debt and Trusts_**

The concept of parallel debt arrangements is not generally recognized under Danish law and any agreement or
document may not be enforceable to the extent it purports to effect such arrangements.

It is uncertain whether Danish law recognizes the concept of trusts, and provisions in documents which intend to
create a trust may not be enforceable.

**Sweden**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (Sw. konkurslag (1987:627)), if a Swedish company is unable to
rightfully pay its debts as they fall due and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can be
declared bankrupt following a bankruptcy petition filed with the competent district court (Sw. tingsrätt) by the debtor or
by a creditor of the debtor.

In the event of a bankruptcy of a Swedish company the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (Sw.
_konkursförvaltare) who will work in the interest of all creditors of the company with the objective of selling the_
company’s assets and distribute the proceeds among the creditors. The bankruptcy estate is deemed to constitute a
separate legal entity.

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors
receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets
and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In general, the
receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the company as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds in
accordance with the mandatory priority rules as primarily set out in the Swedish rights of priority act, as amended (Sw.
_Förmånsrättslagen (1970:979)) (the “Rights of Priority Act”). In the interim, the receiver in bankruptcy will take over_
the management and control of the company. Thus, the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be
entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets.

A declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in
bankruptcy may in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing contracts. A
clause in a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of bankruptcy proceedings or similar is
likely to be unenforceable (the bankruptcy estate shall always be given a right to fulfil the company’s obligations
according to a contract). If the bankruptcy estate steps into the contract and performance by the creditor is due, the
creditor may demand that the bankruptcy estate performs its newly assumed obligations as well or, if a grace period has
been granted, request that the bankruptcy estate, without unreasonable delay, provides acceptable security for its
performance. If performance by the creditor is not due, the creditor may request security where this is necessary in order
to protect it against loss. If the bankruptcy estate does not step into the contract within a reasonable time after the
creditor’s demand or if it does not comply with the creditor’s request to provide security, the creditor may terminate the
contract.

**_Enforcement Process_**

In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings, in respect of real estate mortgages and business
mortgages (Sw. företagshypotek) and (as relevant) assets in the possession of the relevant security provider, an
enforcement process is initiated by the creditor obtaining an enforcement order from the Swedish Enforcement Authority
(Sw. Kronofogden) or the courts. Upon obtaining an enforcement order against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the
Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim. In respect of pledges over certain other types of assets,
such as over shares, receivables, bank accounts, trademarks and contractual rights, enforcement can be carried out by the
security holder itself. A provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement is typically included
in any pledge agreement between the security provider and the secured party or its agent. The secured party is typically
entitled to enforce the security through a sale of the collateral. However, certain restrictions apply to the procedure for
such a sale. In general, when enforcing the security, the secured party is under a duty of care in relation to the security
provider and the security granted. This duty includes, inter alia, an obligation to notify the security provider of any
liquidation or sale of the collateral, to account for the proceeds of such liquidation or sale, and to pay to the security
provider that portion of the proceeds of such liquidation or sale which exceeds the debt secured by such asset. The
security provider should, if the circumstances are not exceptional, be given prior notice of the contemplated enforcement
and also of the time and location of the sale. Furthermore, sufficient notice should be given to prospective purchasers in

277


-----

order to create reasonable preconditions for a market price being obtained in the sale. Where the secured party has been
granted the right to enforce the security through a private sale, such sale must be made to a party unaffiliated with the
secured party unless the market price of the security can be independently and objectively established prior to or shortly
after enforcement and the security is sold at such price. Pledges over receivables and other claims are, if the receivable
or claim has fallen due, normally enforced through the secured party collecting the payment as opposed to selling the
receivable. Certain categories of assets (such as real property) may however only be enforced through the Swedish
Enforcement Authority.

Enforcement of security in bankruptcy is also subject to certain restrictions. A holder of a real property mortgage,
a business mortgage or security over specific assets in the possession of the relevant security provider may demand that
the relevant assets are sold by the receiver in bankruptcy without undue delay, provided that the underlying claim is not
disputed or has been confirmed in a non-appealable decision. This rule does however not apply to such assets as are
necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s business. The receiver in bankruptcy may thus postpone such sale if the
receiver in bankruptcy determines that the bankruptcy estate would either incur a considerable loss or that the
implementation of a public composition proceeding (Sw. offentligt ackord) would become substantially more difficult,
provided that a postponement is not unreasonable to the secured party. A secured party holding a possessory pledge over
moveable property (such as shares) may arrange for the sale of the moveable property at a public auction (but not sell the
moveable property privately unless the receiver in bankruptcy consents). Such secured party must however give the
receiver in bankruptcy an opportunity to arrange payment of the debtor’s debt to the creditor in order to redeem the
moveable property to the bankruptcy estate, and the moveable property may not, without the consent of the receiver in
bankruptcy, be sold earlier than four weeks after the oath administration meeting (Sw. edgångssammanträde) held as a
part of the bankruptcy proceedings. However, financial instruments and currency are exempt from the requirement for
the receiver in bankruptcy’s consent. The secured party may either sell such financial instruments or currency
immediately or assume ownership (against reduction of the secured debt with the market value of such assets or, if the
market value of the assets exceeds the outstanding debt, against repayment to the debtor of the surplus), provided that
the realization is done in a commercially viable manner. Should the security granted consist of rights over unlisted
shares in a subsidiary of the debtor, the receiver in bankruptcy must still be given an opportunity to redeem the shares
prior to the sale or deduction.

**_Priority of Certain Creditors_**

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Rights of Priority Act,
which states the order in which creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, under Swedish insolvency law
competing claims have equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets.
However, some preferential and secured creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law,
have the benefit of payment before all other creditors (in the case of preferential creditors only) and before all unsecured
creditors out of the assets that secure the creditors’ claims (in the case of secured creditors only). There are two types of
preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights. Specific preferential rights apply to certain specific property
and give the creditor a right to payment from such separate property. General preferential rights cover all property
belonging to the debtor’s estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor
a preferential right to payment. Claims that do not carry any of the above mentioned preferential rights or exceed the
value of the security provided for such claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal
standing as against each other (unless subordinated). A claim can be subordinated if, for instance, the creditor has
entered into an agreement with the debtor stipulating such subordination. It should be noted that, in the case of
bankruptcy, claims in relation to the bankruptcy estate (a legal entity separate from the debtor) due to costs relating to
the bankruptcy (including fees payable to the receiver in bankruptcy), may have priority over claims in relation to the
debtor.

**_Challengeable Transactions_**

In Swedish bankruptcy and, if certain conditions are met, company reorganization proceedings, transactions can
(in certain circumstances and subject to a time limit) be reversed and the assets being the subject of such transaction can
then be returned to the bankruptcy estate (or the company subject to company reorganization). Broadly, these
transactions include, among others, situations where the debtor has (i) conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially
to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings,
(ii) created a new security interest or provided a guarantee that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured
obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary, or (iii) paid
a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by
using unusual means of payment. In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that
were made during three or six months preceding the commencement of the relevant Swedish insolvency proceedings.

278


-----

Where the other party to a transaction is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor (such as a subsidiary or parent
company) or aware of inter alia the insolvency of the debtor, longer time limits apply and in others there are no time
limits.

**_Limitations on Enforceability Due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_**

The Swedish Reorganization Act (Sw. Lag (1996:764) om företagsrekonstruktion) provides companies facing
difficulties in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve these difficulties without being declared
bankrupt. A petition for company reorganization may be presented to the court by the company or a creditor of the
company but a reorganization order may only be granted subject to the company’s approval. Corporate reorganization
proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may under certain conditions
be extended for up to one year.

An administrator (Sw. rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and
safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the company. However, the company remains in full possession of the
business except that the consent of the administrator is required for important decisions, such as paying a debt that has
arisen prior to the granting of a reorganization order, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the granting of the
reorganization order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a
substantial value for the company’s business. However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the
transaction (but may jeopardize the reorganization).

Upon the opening of company reorganization proceedings, the administrator must notify the creditors of the
reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the proposed action to be taken to resolve
the company’s difficulties. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the opportunity to
express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any of the creditors, the
court shall appoint a creditors’ committee of a maximum of three persons. The administrator shall, if possible, consult
with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions.

The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts entered into by the
company. However, the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings entails limitations in the contracting party’s
right to terminate a contract due to the company’s delay in payment or performance. Such limitations are similar to that
which is stated above in respect of a bankruptcy estate’s right to step into existing contracts. The limitations are not
applicable where a creditor has security over, inter alia, financial instruments or receivables originating from a loan
granted by a credit institution. During the reorganization procedure, the company’s business activities continue in the
ordinary course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the company
may not pay a debt that arose prior to the granting of the reorganization order without the consent of the administrator
and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy
in respect of the company will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of
security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the
secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a Swedish law pledge over the
shares in a Swedish limited liability company provided that the share certificates of such company has been delivered to
the secured creditor or its agent and with a Swedish law pledge over a loan governed by a negotiable debt instrument
(Sw. löpande skuldebrev) where such negotiable debt instrument has been delivered to the secured creditor or its agent.

During reorganization proceedings, the company may apply to the courts requesting public composition
proceedings (Sw. offentligt ackord) which means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced on a percentage
basis. The proposal for a public composition must meet certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the
creditors which are allowed to vote, in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such
public composition. Creditors with set-off rights and preferred creditors will not participate in the composition unless
they wholly or partly waive their set-off rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor’s full
claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the
proposed composition. The public composition is binding on all creditors that were entitled to participate, i.e. also
creditors who have not attended the creditors’ meeting will be bound. However, the obligations of a guarantor under a
guarantee provided in respect of a creditor’s claim which has been reduced by way of public composition will not be
reduced correspondingly but will remain valid up to the original amount of such creditor’s claim.

**_Liquidation Due to Capital Deficiency_**

Pursuant to the Swedish companies act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)), as amended (the “Swedish
Companies Act”), whenever a company’s board of directors has a reason to assume that, as a result of losses or

279


-----

reductions in the value of the company’s assets or any other event, the company’s equity is less than half the registered
share capital, the company’s board of directors shall prepare a special balance sheet (Sw. kontrollbalansräkning) and
have the auditors examine it. The same obligation arises if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant to
Chapter 4 of the Swedish Enforcement Code (Sw. utsökningsbalken (1981:774)) is found to lack seizeable assets.

If the special balance sheet shows that the equity of the company is less than half of the registered share capital,
the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, issue a notice to call a shareholders’ meeting which shall consider
whether the company shall go into liquidation (initial shareholders’ meeting). The special balance sheet and an auditor’s
report with respect thereto shall be presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting.

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders’ meeting has not
resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight months of the initial
shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue whether the company shall go into liquidation (second shareholders’
meeting). Prior to the second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new special balance sheet and
cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance sheet and an auditor’s report thereon
shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting.

A shareholders’ resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies
Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on such
voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second shareholders’ meeting is not held within the period of
time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second shareholders’ meeting was not
reviewed by the company’s auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts
to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a
liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control of the company and shall sell the company’s assets and
settle the company’s debts with the proceeds. The liquidator shall give notice to the company’s unknown creditors and
creditors that have not lodged their claims with the liquidator within six months following such notice will have forfeited
their rights to their claims.

**_Limitations on the Value of a Guarantee_**

A Swedish limited liability company may not provide a guarantee for the obligations of a parent or sister
company, unless they belong to the same group of companies and the parent company of that group is domiciled within
the EEA, or unless the loan, for which the guarantee is provided, is intended to be used exclusively in the borrower’s
business operations and the guarantee is provided for purely commercial reasons. Furthermore, if a Swedish limited
liability company provides any guarantee without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return, such guarantee will, in
whole or in part, be considered a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only (i) to the extent there is sufficient
coverage for the restricted equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution (i.e., at the time
the guarantee is provided) (where the aggregate amount available for distribution during the period from the annual
general meeting until the following year’s annual general meeting shall be calculated on the basis of the balance sheet
approved by the shareholders at the first annual general meeting, taking into account changes in the restricted equity
capital after such annual general meeting) and (ii) if it would be considered prudent by the Swedish limited liability
company to undertake such distribution after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed by the
nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish limited liability company’s business or the Swedish limited liability
company’s need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or financial position in general. Where the Swedish limited
liability company is a parent company, the latter assessment is made also on a group level.

It should also be noted that laws relating to financial assistance in Sweden prohibit limited liability companies
incorporated in Sweden from providing guarantees for obligations of any person where such obligations are being
incurred for the purpose of acquiring shares in the company itself or in any superior member of the same Swedish group
of companies.

The guarantee of the Guarantor is limited in accordance with the above restrictions relating to prohibited
security, distribution of assets and financial assistance and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such
entities thereunder to the extent required by the above restrictions.

**_Creation of Valid Security Interests_**

In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law, the property subject to such security interest must
fulfil the following criteria: (a) there must be an underlying debtor-creditor relationship in respect of the obligations

280


-----

which the security purports to secure; (b) the security provider must grant the security interest, typically in the form of a
pledge agreement; (c) the security assets must be sufficiently specified; and (d) an act perfecting the security interest
must take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type.

Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the secured
party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of its right to
control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created
under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over,
freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event would
therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security interests have been perfected.
Security interests that are subject to such delayed perfection stand the risk of being subject to clawback claims whereby
the security interest might be held invalid and unenforceable.

In the case of shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the share certificates endorsed in
blank to the possession of the pledgee. The pledgee is not entitled to vote for the shares but is, absent agreement to the
contrary, entitled to any bonus shares and any new shares issued in rights issues. Unless the pledgee and the security
provider agree otherwise, the security provider is entitled to all dividends until the bankruptcy date.

The right to future dividends can however be pledged to the pledgee or to a third party. As set out above, any
security purported to be created over, inter alia, (i) future shares before such shares are issued and/or (ii) dividends after
a certain triggering event, will not be perfected from the outset and may as such be vulnerable under applicable
provisions of Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security
provider.

**_Security Granted in favor of Secured Parties represented by a Security Agent_**

It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of the
secured parties. However, it is not established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power of attorney or a
mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent, can be made irrevocable. It should be noted that any powers
of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the
bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers.

**_Trust_**

Currently, Swedish law does not contain any provisions for trusts to be formed and trustees to be appointed.
While Swedish law does not know the concept of trust, it is generally believed that a trustee that has been appointed
under foreign law, provided that a trustee is capable of being appointed under the laws governing such appointment, will
be recognized and acknowledged in Sweden and that such an appointed trustee may be able to claim and enforce or
procure the enforcement of the rights of the beneficiaries under the trust, subject to the terms of the relevant documents.

**_Parallel Debt_**

The concept of parallel debt arrangements is not generally recognized under Swedish law and any agreement or
document may not be enforceable to the extent it purports to effect such arrangements.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Whereas Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish kronor, judgments will be
enforced in Swedish kronor, generally at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of enforcement rather than at the
date of judgment.

**_Stamp Duty_**

No Swedish stamp duty will be payable on the granting of the Notes Guarantee by the Guarantor.

**Norway**

**_Financial Assistance_**

Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Private Limited Companies Act of 1997 No. 44 / Norwegian Public Limited
Companies Act of 1997 No. 45 (Aksjeloven and Allmennaksjeloven) (respectively and together, the “Acts,” and each an

281


-----

“Act”) restricts a Norwegian private or public limited liability company from granting credit to, guaranteeing or
providing security for the obligations of, its shareholders or a party related to the shareholder beyond its distributable
reserves (free equity) and then further provided that satisfactory security for repayment/recovery has been established.

The above restriction does not, however, apply to providing credit to or guaranteeing or providing security for the
obligations of a parent company or another company within the same “group.” This exemption must be read in
conjunction with the group definition in Section 1-3 of the Acts which, broadly speaking, includes Norwegian limited
liability companies. Furthermore, there is an exemption for providing credit to or guaranteeing or providing security for
the obligations of any legal entity which has “decisive influence” over the company as mentioned in Section 1-3 of the
Acts provided that the credit, security or guarantee is granted in order to benefit the financial interest of the group of
companies. Section 1-3 defines “decisive influence” as holding or otherwise controlling at least a majority of the voting
shares in the company or having the right to elect or discharge a majority of the members of the board of directors of
such company. In practice, this exception will be applicable to a Norwegian wholly owned subsidiary of a foreign
company provided that the credit, security and/or guarantee is established in order to benefit the financial interest of the
group of companies.

In addition to the restrictions with regard to, among others, upstream and cross-stream guarantees and security as
outlined above, Section 8-10 of the Acts prohibits a Norwegian private or public limited liability company from
providing financial assistance (including putting assets at disposal, granting loans or providing security or guarantees) in
connection with the acquisition of its shares or in connection with the acquisition of shares in a parent company
(including any intermediate parent company) unless the value of such financial assistance is within the company’s
distributable reserves and, provided further, that satisfactory security for repayment has been established, the financial
assistance is provided on ordinary business terms and principles and that the acquisition is of fully paid shares.
Furthermore, before such assistance is granted, certain procedural rules must be complied with. The board of directors
shall ensure that the beneficiary parties are subject to a credit assessment and the board will be required to prepare a
statement which, inter alia, describes the background for and the terms and consequences of the financial assistance.
Such statement will have to be presented to the general meeting of the company, which in turn must approve the
financial assistance.

The practical restriction in respect of financial assistance referred to above applies irrespective of whether such
parent company is a Norwegian or a foreign company, and there are no general exemptions available except for special
cases of real property financing and employee share purchase programs. The restriction applies not only to the granting
of loans, guarantees and security, but also to making assets available and other transfers that are not lawful distributions
in accordance with the Acts. The assistance is restricted if made in connection with the acquisition of shares, which may
also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition (such as the refinancing of an acquisition loan facility
or the subsequent merger of the target company and the acquiring entity). This means that in practice a Norwegian
guarantor cannot give credit, guarantee or provide security for any loans which have been used to finance the acquisition
of the shares of the Issuer, a parent company (including any intermediate parent company) or the Norwegian guarantor.

As a consequence of these restrictions, the value of the Notes Guarantees and any security provided by a
Norwegian guarantor may be reduced to zero to the extent it secures obligations relating to the acquisition of shares in
itself or its parent company. In addition, the Notes Guarantees or security interest infringing the limitations set forth in
Section 8-10 of the Acts will be void, and any funds paid out will have to be repaid. Finally, an illegal arrangement of
this kind may give rise to directors’ liability issues. The Notes Guarantees and the security interests provided by
Norwegian companies are subject to limitation language substantially in the form as follows:

“The obligations and liabilities of each Guarantor incorporated in Norway (each, a “Norwegian Guarantor”) for
the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes Guarantees, shall be deemed to have been given only to the extent such
guarantee does not violate Section 8-7 and/or 8-10 of the Norwegian Limited Companies Act of June 13, 1997 No. 44 or
the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act of June 13, 1997 No. 45 (as the case may be) (the “Norwegian
Companies Act”), regarding unlawful financial assistance and the liability of each Norwegian Guarantor will only apply
to the extent permitted by such provision of the Norwegian Companies Act. Such limitations on the liabilities and
obligations of any Norwegian Guarantor may have the effect of reducing the amount of obligations or liabilities assumed
and/or the amount guaranteed or secured to zero, to the extent to which any proceeds under the Senior Secured Notes are
used in connection with the acquisition of shares in the Norwegian Guarantor or its parent.

The limitations set forth in these sections will apply mutatis mutandis to any security created by a Norwegian
Guarantor over the Collateral and to any guarantee, indemnity, any similar obligation resulting in a payment obligation
and payment, including, but not limited to, set-off and made by any Norwegian Guarantor.”

**_Insolvency_**

Norwegian insolvency legislation is regulated by the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 No. 58
(Konkursloven) (the “Bankruptcy Act”), which sets forth the various procedures to be followed both in the case of courtadministered debt negotiations and bankruptcy proceedings, and the Creditors Recovery Act of June 8, 1984 No. 59
(Dekningsloven) (the “Recovery Act”) containing provisions on, among other things, the priority of claims.

The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of the
debtor’s assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of transactions (including the
securing of existing claims) made prior to bankruptcy, (iv) the handling of the debtor’s contractual relationships and
(v) the distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt
company are continued, they are formally continued at the risk of the bankruptcy estate, but in practice at the risk of, and
only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the creditors
(holding or pretending to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy.

There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its
debt as it becomes due (the “cash flow test”), and (ii) the debtor must be in “deficit” (the company’s debts must exceed
the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values) (the “balance sheet test”).

During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor’s assets are seized and controlled by the court-appointed liquidator
(usually a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor’s assets
into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash
to the rightful creditors.

All of the debtor’s assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of
the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets
held by third parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner, or if the acquisition lacks legal
protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal
entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights with respect to the seized assets, including, but
not limited to, the realization of assets.

Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of
the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle,
realize the security, and cover their claims; however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number of categories of
security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy
estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain
conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and other holding
legal rights in the assets.

Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the estimated value or sales value of
all assets secured by the debtor for its own debt or by a third party for the debtor’s indebtedness (limited to the
Norwegian Court Fee (presently being in the amount of NOK 1130) multiplied by 700 for each such asset registered in
an asset register). Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments)
established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act No. 17/2004 (the “Financial Collateral Act”) or the
Norwegian Liens Act No. 2/1980 section 6-4(9).

Any under-secured amount (any amount exceeding the value of the secured assets) will be deemed an ordinary
(unsecured) trade claim.

In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:

     - secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset – either after the
realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate);

     - super-priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator’s costs and obligations
of the estate);

     - salary claims (within certain limitations);

283


-----

     - tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations);

     - ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditors
and indemnity claims); and

     - subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims
subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims).

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried
out in the three- to twelve-month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years)
before the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security
established for existing debt and transactions at an undervalue. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain
circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper
manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets
which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’ claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate
is increased to ten years.

**_Solvent Enforcement_**

Enforcement of security normally requires that the pledgee or chargee files an application to the enforcement
authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced without the
involvement of the enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the Financial Collateral
Act and charges over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured party such right of enforcement is typically
included in any security agreement between the pledgor/chargor and the secured party.

Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally binding
judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the creditor may apply
to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Norwegian courts may award judgment in currencies other than Norwegian krone, but the debtor is nevertheless
in relation to such judgment entitled to make payment in Norwegian krone at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date
of such payment.

**_Parallel Debt_**

The concept of parallel debt arrangements is not generally recognized under Norwegian law and any agreement
or document may not be enforceable to the extent it purports to effect such arrangements.

**Finland**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency law of Finland.

**_Applicable Insolvency Law_**

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Finnish law. The first, company reorganization
(yrityssaneeraus), is intended to investigate whether the business has a reasonable chance to continue and, if so, to
rehabilitate the company’s viable business, ensure its continued viability and make arrangements with creditors. The
second, bankruptcy (konkurssi), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a debtor to its creditors.

**_Company Reorganization_**

If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is probable that a company reorganization
will remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than for a short period, an application for company
reorganization can be made to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors. Further, the initiation of company
reorganization proceedings is possible – in theory, irrespective of the company’s solvency situation – when at least two
creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts, and who are not related to the
debtor, file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company
reorganization. If there are no specific legal barriers to company reorganization and, consequently, the court approves
the application and opens company reorganization proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint an administrator
(selvittäjä).

284


-----

All existing claims against the company are suspended as of the commencement of the company reorganization.
The suspension as a main rule prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the
restructuring debts (although debts arising after the filing of the company reorganization application can be repaid and
enforced) and the seizure of assets. The suspensions are in force until the company reorganization program has been
confirmed by the district court or the proceedings have been dismissed.

Creditors with equal ranking have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts within the
company reorganization program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Company Reorganization Act
47/1993, as amended, (Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta), the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured
debts in the company reorganization program:

(i) change the repayment schedule;

(ii) order that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest
and other credit costs only second;

(iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt;
and

(iv) reduce the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt.

The company reorganization program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt. Consequently, the
company reorganization procedure could result in holders of the Notes receiving a right to recover considerably less than
they would otherwise be entitled to recover under the Note Guarantees.

Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security
interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, insofar as the value of the security at the
commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after the
deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. Regarding business mortgages, only 50% of the value of
the mortgaged property will be considered as secured debt. The value of the property will be determined by the
reorganization program. The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt:

(i) change the repayment schedule;

(ii) order that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and
other credit costs second; or

(iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt.
Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the
security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully
adequate security.

Payments on a secured debt shall be determined so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be
repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the
creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed one-half of the original credit period. As for
reducing interest and other credit costs, a court will take into consideration the length of the remaining credit period, so
that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs.

**_Bankruptcy_**

A debtor or its creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a bankruptcy court of competent jurisdiction when the
debtor has failed to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary. If the application is approved, an estate
administrator (or several estate administrators) of the bankruptcy estate (pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by the court.

A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and
use the proceeds received therefrom in payment of the creditors’ claims. In order to achieve the objective of bankruptcy,
the debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The
creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of
all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decisionmaking powers of the creditors.

285


-----

As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a
“claim letter”), by delivering it to the estate administrator no later than the deadline set by the estate administrator. The
obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a creditor with a secured claim. A creditor who
holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of and within a time limit
set by the estate administrator, provide the information on receivables and collateral that should be provided in a claim
letter. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over the assets of the debtor as security of a claim against the debtor in
bankruptcy or a debt owed by some other debtor shall file the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act
120/2004, as amended, (Konkurssilaki). If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, a value in euro for the
purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the
bankruptcy proceedings. A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must,
when giving notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a
claim letter.

Creditors have an equal right to a payment from the funds of the bankruptcy estate in the proportion of the
amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, the following creditors have precedence over
unsecured creditors to receive their claims:

(i) secured creditors and holders of retention rights have priority to the proceeds relating to the relevant
asset;

(ii) creditors of the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, creditors with claims on the basis of
contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the
bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and creditors of a debt that has arisen between the
commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceeding; and

(iii) creditors with claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive prior to other claims a
disbursement of 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets.

The rights of the above-mentioned preferential creditors may adversely affect the interests of holders of the
Notes. Bankruptcy of the Finnish Guarantor could result in holders of the Notes recovering considerably less than they
would have otherwise been entitled to recover under the Note Guarantees.

Finnish law prescribes claims that are to be settled lastly. In practice, the most significant of such claims are the
interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the bankruptcy, a bond issued with
a low priority and a subordinated loan. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal
charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the
aggregate net proceeds. However, secured creditors that are secured pursuant to a security over movable or immovable
property (excluding business mortgage, which requires a separate judgement) may exercise their right to enforce such
collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale for
a maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate only if the creditor
protected by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Law_**

Pursuant to the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to Bankruptcy Estate 758/1991, as amended, (Laki
_takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään) (the “Recovery Act”), certain acts performed by a debtor can be revoked if the rights_
of creditors have been prejudiced by those acts. According to the Finnish Company Reorganization Act and the Finnish
Enforcement Code 705/2007, as amended, (Ulosottokaari), the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are
also to be applied in company reorganization and enforcement proceedings.

The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator in the company reorganization and certain creditors may
seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement proceedings.
The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor’s
counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. Certain general rules for recovery apply to all
transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and
the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for
bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions
performed after such date) may be recovered if:

(i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly

(a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors,

286


-----

(b) places property beyond the reach of other creditors, or

(c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors;

(ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in
case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted;

(iii) the counterparty of the transaction knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or
the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and

(iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of
which the transaction is considered improper.

The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between
the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified
knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal)
persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of
the transaction. Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless
of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such
transactions include, among other things:

(i) payments received through enforcement;

(ii) the payment of debts; and

(iii) the granting of security.

Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization
or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the
debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if:

(i) unusual means of payment have been used;

(ii) the payment was premature; or

(iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor.

However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held
as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company
reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a
person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if:

(i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or

(ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not
been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit.

When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the
bankruptcy estate or the debtor. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that had been paid for
the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the
compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation to return the
compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value
of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause inconvenience to the party under
such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead of
returning the property.

The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable
property. Accordingly, the validity of the Note Guarantees or any payment made thereunder may be challenged and it is
possible that such challenge would be successful. If the granting of a Note Guarantee or a payment thereunder is
successfully challenged, then the granting of such Note Guarantee could be nullified or the payment recovered. As a

287


-----

result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of a Note Guarantee, and the value of
any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to a Note Guarantee could also be subject to recovery
from the holders of the Notes.

**_Limitations_**

Pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act 624/2006, as amended, (Osakeyhtiölaki), a Finnish company may not
provide financing, or grant guarantees or security to secure the financing, of the acquisition of its or its parent company’s
shares (financial assistance). Further, a company can only distribute its assets in ways specified in the Finnish
Companies Act. Other transactions that reduce the assets of the company or increase its liabilities without a sound
business reason constitute unlawful distribution of assets.

Granting of guarantees and security is subject to the rules applicable to distribution of funds and therefore,
requires that the granting of guarantee/security is based on sound business reasons (corporate benefit) and it may not
otherwise constitute a violation of applicable mandatory provisions of Finnish corporate law. In addition to the corporate
benefit requirement, the granting of the guarantee/security has to be within the limits of the company’s business purpose
(as set out in its articles of association) and the company may not be insolvent and the granting of security may not result
in the company becoming insolvent.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer has been advised by Allen & Overy, société en commandite simple (inscrite au barreau de
_Luxembourg), its Luxembourg counsel, that, although there is no treaty between Luxembourg and the United States_
regarding the reciprocal enforcement of judgments, a valid final and conclusive judgment against the Issuer with respect
to the Notes obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment remains in full force
and effect after all appeals as may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been
taken, may be recognized and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg subject to compliance
with the enforcement procedures set out in Articles 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg Nouveau code de procédure civile
being, together with applicable Luxembourg case law:

     - the foreign judgment must be enforceable in the country of origin;

     - the court of origin must have had jurisdiction both according to its own laws and to the Luxembourg conflict
of jurisdictions rules;

     - the foreign proceedings must have been regular in light of the laws of the country of origin;

     - the rights of defense must not have been violated;

     - the foreign court must have applied the law which is designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules,
or, at least, the judgment must not contravene the principles underlying these rules;

     - the considerations of the foreign judgment as well as the judgment as such must not contravene
Luxembourg international public policy; and

     - the foreign judgment must not have been rendered as a result of or in connection with an evasion of
Luxembourg law (“fraude à la loi”).

The Issuer has been also advised by Allen & Overy, société en commandite simple (inscrite au barreau de
_Luxembourg), that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules,_
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law if the choice of the foreign law was not made bona fide or if
the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or if pleaded and proved, the foreign law was contrary to Luxembourg
mandatory provisions (lois impératives) or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules. In an action brought in
Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to
grant the remedies sought.

**Denmark**

The United States and Denmark currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not be recognized or enforceable in Denmark without a
review of the merits of the case.

In the predominant situations, it would be necessary to initiate legal proceedings before a Danish court for the
purpose of reinvestigating the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. federal or state courts, however, under
such legal proceedings, the judgment of the U.S. federal or state court may serve as evidence.

There is also a doubt that a Danish court would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in
an original action brought in Denmark on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. Further, certain remedies available
under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, may not
be allowed in Danish courts as contrary to (i) Danish public policy and (ii) the mandatory rules of the laws of any
country with which the transaction has a significant connection, including, among others, punitive damages. A Danish
court may grant damages only to the extent necessary to compensate for actual economic losses.

**Sweden**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of December 12, 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial

295


-----

matters (the “2012 Brussels Regulation”), a judgment entered against a company incorporated in Sweden (a “Swedish
Party”) in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e. all Member States of the European Union) and which is
enforceable in such a Member State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden upon the satisfaction of the formal
requirements of the 2012 Brussels Regulation without any declaration of enforceability being required. It should be
noted, however, that a party may apply for refusal of recognition or refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance
with the 2012 Brussels Regulation. Such an application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (tingsrätt).

Pursuant to the 2012 Brussels Regulation, if a judgment contains a measure or an order which is not known under
the laws of the Member State in which the recognition of the judgment is invoked or in which the enforcement of the
judgment, the court settlement or the authentic instrument is sought, that measure or order shall, to the extent possible,
be adapted to a measure or order known under the laws of that Member State which has equivalent effects attached to it
and which pursues similar aims and interests.

Pursuant to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and
Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a
Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a Contracting Party, will be
enforceable in Sweden if it meets the following requirements: (a) a motion for enforcement has been filed with the
relevant district court (Sw. tingsrätt) as provided by law and has been granted; (b) that no appeals lie against the
judgment entered in the courts of such contracting state; (c) that the courts of such contracting state had jurisdiction;
(d) that summons has been duly served on the respondent in the proceedings before the courts of such contracting state;
(e) that the judgment is not irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the State in
which enforcement is sought; and (f) that the judgment does not contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or
the public policy of Sweden.

A judgment entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not, under the terms of the 2012
Brussels Regulation or the Lugano Convention, a Member State (as defined in the 2012 Brussels Regulation) or a
Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention), for example, the United States, would not be recognized or
enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without a retrial on its merits. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of
money rendered by the courts of such state, would not be directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden.
However, there is Swedish case law to indicate that such judgments:

(a) that are based on contract which expressly acknowledge the jurisdiction of courts outside Sweden;

(b) that were rendered under observance of due process of law;

(c) against which there lies no further right to appeal; and

(d) the recognition of which would not manifestly contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the
public policy of Sweden,

should be acknowledged without retrial on its merits.

In order to enforce any such judgement in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil law
action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal or
executive or other public authority of Sweden. In such an action, a judgment rendered by the courts of such state may be
regarded as evidence of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of the relevant foreign law, but the competent
Swedish authority may also choose to rehear the dispute ab initio. Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be
conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for
admissibility and/or enforceability, the translation into Swedish of any relevant document. Further assistance from
Swedish authorities in the service of process in connection with foreign proceedings might require the observance of
certain procedural and other regulations.

Swedish courts may award judgments or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but the
judgment debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgment debt (even though denominated in a foreign
currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment (however, the judgment creditor
may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert such local currency into the foreign currency after payment
and remove such foreign currency from Sweden), and a choice of currency provisions by the parties to an agreement
may not be upheld by Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish kronor.

It is not established by Swedish judicial precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney or a
mandate of agency, including the appointment of a service of process agent, can be made irrevocable and therefore any
powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at
the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the Swedish Party giving such powers.

**Norway**

A judgment against the Issuer or any Guarantor in the courts of a state which is not, under the terms of the
Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a
“contracting state” (as defined in the Lugano Convention) or a state with which Norway has entered into a convention on
the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments, would not be recognized or enforceable in Norway as a matter of
right unless the jurisdiction of such court has been specifically agreed between the parties in a civil matter in accordance
with Section 19-16, cfr. Section 4-6, of the Norwegian Dispute Act (Tvisteloven) or the recognition and enforcement of
such judgments are otherwise accepted under Norwegian law. However, such judgments may be admissible as evidence
in the courts of law, executive or other public authorities of Norway and may in such capacity carry persuasive authority
depending on the merits of the judgment without a retrial on its merits.

The foregoing could imply, inter alia, that a judgment by a U.S. court would not be recognized or enforceable in
Norway as a matter of right. A judgment against an Issuer or any Guarantor in the courts of a state which is, under the
terms of the Lugano Convention, a “contracting state” (as defined in the Lugano Convention) or a state with which
Norway has entered into a convention on the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments, and judgments rendered
by a court whose jurisdiction have been expressly agreed to and accepted by the party, in writing and in a particular civil
matter, in accordance with the Norwegian Dispute Act, and such judgments for which the recognition and enforcement is
otherwise accepted under Norwegian law, would be recognized and enforceable in Norway, but only insofar as such
recognition and enforcement would not be in breach of mandatory law or contrary to public policy in Norway. Only
creditors of a claim may have active judicial standing in a Norwegian court; therefore, a security agent or other
representative of the creditors may seek enforcement of a claim but such claim may have to be supported by the actual
creditors of such claim.

**Finland**

We have been advised by our Finnish legal counsel that there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and
Finland. Courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under
Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and
enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute
circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to
the matter in dispute.

The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not
being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be
considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in
an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system.

As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a
Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation for actual losses and damages as
proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims
presented lies with the claimant.

A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the
evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of
documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not
recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is
very limited. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is
usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the
proceedings.

The consolidated interim financial statements of Stark Group A/S and its wholly owned subsidiary undertakings

**The independent auditor’s review report on the consolidated interim financial statements**

**To the shareholders of Stark Group A/S**

We have reviewed the interim consolidated financial statements of Stark Group A/S for the three months period ended
31 October 2017 which comprise consolidated interim statements of income, comprehensive income, financial position,
changes in equity and cash flows and notes, including description of accounting policies.

**Management’s responsibility for the consolidated interim financial statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated interim financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as
Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the consolidated interim financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the consolidated interim financial statements. We conducted our review
in accordance with the International Standard on Engagements to Review Interim Financial Information Performed by
the Independent Auditor of the Entity and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation. This requires us to
conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated interim financial
statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial
reporting framework. This also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with the International Standard on Engagements to
Review Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity is a limited assurance
engagement. The auditor performs procedures primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and others within
the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and evaluates the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on the consolidated interim
financial statements.

**Conclusion**

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated interim financial
statements do not give a true and fair view of the Group’s assets, liabilities and financial position at 31 October 2017 and
of its financial performance for the three months period then ended in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial
_Reporting, as adopted by the EU._

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements**

**For the three months ended 31 October 2017**

**1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements**

**Basis of Preparation**

The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements include Stark Group A/S (the ‘Company’) and its wholly
owned subsidiary undertakings (collectively, the ‘Group’).

The consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended 31 October 2017 have been prepared in
accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (IAS 34) as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and adopted by the European Union.

The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under
the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets that are measured at fair value.

The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the presentational
currency of the Group.

The accounting policies of the Group are described in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group
for the year ended 31 July 2017 and have been applied consistently in these unaudited consolidated interim financial
statements.

**Accounting developments and changes**

The following standards have been published, but not yet applied:

a) IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”

b) IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”

c) IFRS 16 “Leasing”

d) IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”

The Directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 17 in future periods will have no
material impact on the financial statements of the Group, but are still assessing the impact.

IFRS 16 will impact the majority of the Group’s operating lease arrangement as each lease will give rise to a
right of use asset, which will be depreciated on a straight-line basis, and a lease liability, with the related interest charge.
This will replace existing lease balances on the balance sheet and charges to the income statement.

The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however the impact will depend on the transition
approach and the contracts in effect at the time of adoption. It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable
estimate of the financial impact on the Group’s consolidated financial results.

There are no other new accounting standards that have been issued but not adopted in these unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements that are expected to have a material impact of the unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements.

The Group’s business activities are subject to significant seasonal influences. Revenue, operating results and net
working capital generally reflect seasonality in the building sector, with the most important trading periods in terms of
revenue, operating results and cash flow historically being in the first and fourth financial quarters as a result of
increased new build and other activity during warmer periods with longer daylight hours, among other things. In the
winter months, the business typically generates less revenue due to lower construction and renovation activity as a result
of cold weather, partially offset by an increase in indoor activities such as painting.

The effective income tax rate was 14.9% for the quarter ended 31 October 2017 and 28.8% for the quarter ended
31 October 2016.

Under the Group’s “Back to Basics” strategy, the Group focused on, among other things, decentralising decision
making processes, developing SME customer base, tailoring product assortment to better serve customers and
developing the Group’s new distribution centre. In connection with these initiatives, the Group incurred costs related to
consulting and advisor fees, inventory write-offs, staffing and bonus payments. The Group considers such costs to be
exceptional by virtue of their size and nature.

In connection with the sale of Silvan the Group incurred a loss on disposal of €1m (note 6). Such costs are
included in discontinued operations.

**Independent Auditor’s Report covering 2014/15**

To the Shareholders of Stark Group A/S

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the Stark Group A/S and its wholly
owned subsidiary undertakings (collectively, the ‘Group’) financial position at 31 July 2015 and of the results of the
Group’s operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015 in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Group for the financial year 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015,
which comprise consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated
statement of financial position, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated cash flow statement and notes,
including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the Group.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements
applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the
_Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group_
in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Management’s responsibilities for the consolidated financial statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the
Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

F 20


-----

 - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s internal control.

 - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by Management.

 - Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

 - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that gives a true and fair view.

 - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the
direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s internal control.

F 22


-----

 - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by Management.

 - Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
consolidated financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

 - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures in the notes, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.

 - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the
direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements**

**Corporate information**

The consolidated financial statements of Stark Group A/S for the years ended 31 July 2017, 2016 and 2015 were
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 26 February 2018.

Stark Group A/S is a private company incorporated in 2003 and registered in Denmark.

The consolidated financial statements include Stark Group A/S (the ‘Company’) and its wholly owned subsidiary
undertakings (collectively, the ‘Group’) listed in Note 29.

The Group is the largest distributor of building materials in the Nordic region with number one national market
positions in Denmark and Sweden. It consists of five businesses, operating a total of 256 branches across four countries,
supported by five distribution centres. The businesses predominantly serve residential RMI and new construction
markets and operates through its strong brands STARK, Neumann Bygg and Beijer Byggmaterial.

**Basis of Preparation**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union, including interpretations issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (‘IASB’) and its committees.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost
convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets that are measured at fair value.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the presentational currency of the Group.

**First time adoption of IFRS**

For the period since its incorporation in 2003 to the year ended 31 July 2005 the Group prepared consolidated
financial statements under the Danish Financial Statements Act. For the financial year ended 31 July 2006 the Group
transitioned to IFRS and prepared consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the
Group stopped preparing consolidated financial statements in the subsequent financial year, following the Group’s
acquisition by Ferguson Plc (‘Ferguson’) in October 2006, as these were no longer required. Since its acquisition by
Ferguson, the Group’s IFRS financial information was prepared and consolidated into the IFRS financial statements of
Ferguson Plc, the Group’s ultimate parent and for a few years for DT Group Holding A/S, the Group’s intermediate
parent.

The Group has taken the option available under IFRS 1.4A that allows the Group to apply the transition rules
under IFRS 1 even though the Group had already transitioned to IFRS in a previous period. Refer to note 29 for
information on how the Group has re- adopted IFRS.

**Accounting developments and changes**

The following standards have been published, but not yet applied:

_a)_ IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”

_b)_ IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”

_c)_ IFRS 16 “Leasing”

_d)_ IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”

The Directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 17 in future periods will have no
material impact on the financial statements of the Group, but are still assessing the impact.

F 29


-----

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

IFRS 16 will impact the majority of the Group’s operating lease arrangement as each lease will give rise to a
right of use asset, which will be depreciated on a straight-line basis, and a lease liability, with the related interest charge.
This will replace existing lease balances on the balance sheet and charges to the income statement.

The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however the impact will depend on the transition
approach and the contracts in effect at the time of adoption. It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable
estimate of the financial impact on the Group’s consolidated financial results.

No other issued standard or interpretation would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

In applying the Group’s accounting policies, various transactions and balances are assessed using estimates and
assumptions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are held to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Should these estimates or assumptions prove incorrect there may be an impact on
the following year’s financial statements. The Group believes that the estimates and assumptions that have been applied
in these consolidated financial statements would not give rise to a material impact within the next financial year. The
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

The Management has made significant estimates and judgements in the following areas:

1) The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors that provide rebates. Many of these
agreements apply to purchases in a calendar year rather than the Group’s financial year, and under certain
agreements the rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are
made. The Group adjusts the cost of purchases to reflect estimated rebates receivable, which can depend
on the projected volume, value and mix of purchases from a vendor through to the end of the qualifying
period. Actual rebates receivable from vendors may differ materially from the estimates on which the cost
of purchases is based.

2) Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged inventories for which the net realisable
value is estimated to be less than the cost. The risk of obsolescence of slow-moving inventory is assessed
by comparing the level of inventory held to future sales projected on the basis of historical experience.
The actual realisable value of inventory may differ materially from the estimated value on which the
provision is based. The Group held provisions in respect of inventory balances at 1 August 2014
amounting to €33 million, €28 million at 31 July 2015, €26 million at 31 July 2016 and €22 million at
31 July 2017.

3) Provision is made for bad debt losses in the respect of the Groups’ trade and other receivables, which are
estimated to occur if a customer subsequently is not able to pay. If the customer’s financial condition
were to deteriorate, and thus are not able to handle the payments, it may be necessary to make further
write down in future periods. In connection with the assessment of whether the Group’s provisions for
bad and doubtful debts is sufficient, management analyses accounts receivable, including historical bad
debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and
also takes account of the extent to which protection is provided through credit insurance arrangements.

4) Provisions for legal claims, environmental restoration and onerous leases are recognised when the Group
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Such provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the
present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.

**Group accounting policies**

A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements is set out below. The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the current and
preceding year.

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**_Consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements includes the results of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its
share of the results of its joint venture drawn up to 31 July 2017.

The trading results of business operations are included in profit from continuing operations from the date of
acquisition or up to the date of sale, or the date of reclassification to discontinued operations.

Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions
are eliminated on consolidation, with the exception of gains/losses required under relevant IFRS accounting standards.

_Exceptional items_

Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. These
items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement category to assist in the understanding of the
trading and financial results of the Group.

Examples of such items that are considered for designation as exceptional items include, but are not limited to:

1. Restructuring expenses

2. Expenses relating to the integration of an acquired business

3. Gains/losses on disposal of businesses

4. Acquisition or divestment related costs principally relating to professional fees

5. Costs arising as a result of material and non-recurring regulatory and litigation matters.

**_Discontinued operations_**

When the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operations it classifies such operations as discontinued. The post-tax profit or
loss of the discontinued operations and gain or loss on disposal is shown as a single line on the face of the income
statement, separate from the other results of the Group.

**_Business combinations_**

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and
liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date,
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. Acquisition related costs are expensed.

The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets
of the subsidiary acquired, negative goodwill, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.

If the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities subsequently differ from the values
calculated at the time of the acquisition, adjustments are made, including goodwill, until 12 months after the date of
acquisition and comparatives are adjusted as necessary. Subsequently, goodwill is not adjusted. Changes in estimates of
contingent consideration are generally recognised in the income statement.

**_Joint ventures_**

A joint venture arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net
assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of the control of an arrangement, which
exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The result and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements
using the equity method.

**_Foreign currencies_**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of
the primary economic environment in which the enterprises operates (the “functional currency”). The Consolidated
Financial Statements are presented in Euros which is the presentational currency of the Group.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate at transaction
date. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated
to the functional currency at the rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the Group income
statement.

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euros at
exchange rates prevailing at the date of the Group balance sheet; profits and losses are translated at average exchange
rates for the relevant accounting periods. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income and are included in the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised
as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary
course of the Group’s activities. Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the
income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have transferred to the buyer and the
amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

Revenue is recorded net of returns, discounts/offers and value added taxes. Revenue is reported by business
segments and geographical areas.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales includes costs for the goods sold and consumed in order to obtain net sales for the year.

The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors providing for purchase rebates. These purchase rebates
are accrued as earned and are recorded initially as a reduction in inventory resulting in a reduction in cost of sales when
the related product is sold.

**_Taxation_**

The tax expense included in the Group income statement consists of current and deferred tax.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Tax expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in the
consolidated statement of changes in equity, in which case it is recognised in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income or directly in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, respectively.

Current tax receivables and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet at the amount calculated on the basis of
the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years.

Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax base of assets and liabilities.

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or
the asset realised based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or
credited directly to the consolidated statement of changes in equity or the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity, or other comprehensive income, respectively.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available
to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.

Tax receivables and liabilities are offset to the extent that there are legal right of set-off, and items are expected
to be settled net or simultaneously.

**_Intangible assets_**

An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the
extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and
that its cost can be measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from
contractual or other legal rights.

Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an
intangible asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs include
software licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software
and internal costs directly attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software. Costs in
respect of training and data conversion are expensed as incurred.

Software costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of 3 — 5 years.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated
impairment losses. Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the
time when the asset is ready for use. Interest expenses on loans raised for financing the construction of property, plant,
machinery and equipment and which are related to the period of construction are recognised in the income statement.

Depreciation based on cost is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets,
which are:

Office buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 years
Commercial buildings and office premises in connection herewith . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years
Plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 — 10 years

Land and property assets under construction are not depreciated.

At balance sheet date, an assessment is made of the residual values, useful life left and amortisation pattern.
Changes are accounted as changes in accounting estimates.

Gains and losses on disposals or retirements of a fixed asset are recognised in the income statement as other
operating income or other operating expenses.

**_Leases_**

Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership (finance leases)
are on inception recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the net present value
of the lease payments computed by applying the interest rate implicit in the lease or an approximated value as the
discount rate. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated and written down for impairment under the same
policy as determined for the other fixed assets of the Group.

F 33

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The remaining lease obligation is capitalised and recognised in the balance sheet under debt, and the interest
element on the lease payments is charged over the lease term to the income statement.

All other leases are considered operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**_Assets and disposal groups held for sale_**

Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing
use in the business.

Where a group of assets and their directly associated liabilities are to be disposed of in a single transaction, such
disposal groups are also classified as held for sale. For this to be the case, the asset or disposal group must be available
for immediate sale in its present condition, and management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the
asset or disposal group which, when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months. Assets or
disposal groups that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell. Assets that are classified as held for sale are not depreciated.

**_Impairment of assets_**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are
tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation and assets under construction are tested for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted present value of the future cash flows expected to arise
from the cash generating unit to which the asset relates, or from the individual asset or asset group.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories, which comprise goods purchased for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. The cost of goods purchased for resale includes import
and custom duties, transport and handling costs, freight and packing costs and other attributable costs less supplier
rebates. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable
selling expenses.

Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged inventories for which the net realisable value is
estimated to be less than the cost. The risk of obsolescence of slow-moving inventory is assessed by comparing the level
of inventory held to estimated future sales on the basis of historical experience.

**_Financial instruments_**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group balance sheet when the Group becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group’s financial instruments comprise trade and other
receivables (including amounts owed by related parties), cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables (including
amounts owed to related parties) and borrowings.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are non-interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no legal right of offset and/or no practice
of net settlement with cash balances. Cash, which is not freely available to the Group, is disclosed as restricted cash.

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**_Borrowings_**

Interest-bearing bank loans from credit institutions and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost
with any difference between proceeds and redemption value being recognised in the Group income statement over the
period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.

**_Trade payables_**

Trade payables are non-interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**_Provisions_**

Provisions are recognised when, in consequence of an event that occurred before or on the balance sheet date, the
Group has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic benefits must be given up to settle the
obligation.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting or
exiting the lease obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the lease.

**_Post-employment obligations_**

Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post-retirement benefits are charged to the income
statement as incurred.

For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value (using the projected unit credit
method) whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised
separately in the Group income statement; service costs are spread systematically over the expected service lives of
employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income. Payments to defined contribution schemes are
recognised as an expense as they fall due.

Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any amount which the Group
expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.

**_Share-based payments_**

Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Ferguson executive share option, long-term
incentive, employee share purchase and ordinary share plan schemes. The Group recognises a compensation cost in
respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using Binomial and Monte Carlo
valuation methodologies.

The options and shares are issued by the ultimate parent company, Ferguson plc, and the Group is charged
annually for their share of the expenses relating to the current year, which is calculated according to IFRS 2 “Share_based Payments”. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. No liability is_
recognised in these Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2017 the Group decided to change its strategy to focus on primarily on business to business customers
and announced its decision to divest the DIY brand, Silvan. On 10 July 2017, an announcement was made with regard to
the agreement to divest Silvan to Aurelius Group, which was completed on 1 August 2017. Silvan is reported as
discontinued operations in the years ended 31 July 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Discontinued operations in the years ended 31 July 2016 and 31 July 2015 also include costs relating to the
Cheapy chain, a Swedish discount chain which was divested in April 2014, and Oscar Peschard, a small Norwegian
branch which was divested in July 2014.

**8. Exceptional items**

Items which are material either because of their size or nature, and which are non-recurring, are presented within
their relevant consolidated income statement category, but highlighted separately on the face of the consolidated income
statement. The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better picture of the Group’s underlying
performance. Items which may be included within the exceptional category include:

1. Gains/(losses) on disposal of businesses,

2. Gains/(losses) on disposal of property,

On 11 January 2017, the Group announced the closure of 30 branches. The total cost of this restructuring
including redundancy payments to affected employees, consulting fees, the write off of inventory, the loss on disposal of
property, plant and equipment, and the rental, maintenance and other infrastructure costs of maintaining the closed
branches, is considered exceptional by virtue of its size and nature.

On 2 March 2017, the Group disposed of its Sanvold business.

In the development of our Nordic strategy of decentralisation of decision making, a focus on SME customers and
the development of our new distribution centre, the Group incurred consulting and advisor costs, which are considered
exceptional by virtue of their size and nature.

Restructuring represents consulting and other advisor costs incurred in relation to restructuring our head office
and STARK Finland which the Group consider to be non-recurring.

The gain/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment relates to the gain on sale of Cheapy in Sweden
during the year ended July 31, 2016, and the loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment in Denmark.

The gain on disposal of businesses represents adjustments to provisions in respect of prior year disposals by
STARK Finland.

In connection with the sale of Silvan, the Group incurred non-recurring transaction and other advisor costs. Such
costs are included in discontinued operations.

The Group has an unrecognized tax loss of €21 million at 31 July 2015, 2016 and 2017 related to an entity
specific loss without expiry. The Group has not recognised the deferred tax assets arising from the loss because it is not
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can use the benefits in the foreseeable
future.

The Group expects it to be probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can use
the benefits from the deferred tax asset from timing differences.

**24. Contingent liabilities**

The Group is involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of the pending lawsuits is not expected to have
material significance on the Group’s the financial position.

Danish Group companies are jointly and severally liable for the tax on the jointly taxed incomes of the Stark
Group. The total amount of corporation tax payable is disclosed in the Annual report of Stark Group Holdings A/S,
which is the management company for joint taxation purposes. Moreover, the group companies are jointly and severally
liable for Danish withholding taxes by way of dividend tax, tax on royalty payments and tax on unearned income. Any
subsequent adjustments of corporation taxes and withholding taxes may increase the Group’s liability.

**25. Financial instruments, risk management policies**

**The Group’s risk management policy**

As a result of its operations, investments and financing, the Group is exposed to changes in exchange and interest
rates. The Group’s financial management is exclusively aimed at the management of financial risks related to finance.
Thus, it is the Group’s policy not to engage in speculation in financial risks.

Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below:

**Capital risk management**

The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise cash flows generated by operations, loans from group
companies under the control of Ferguson plc and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions. In order to
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group has historically paid dividends to its shareholders or sold assets to
reduce debt.

**Liquidity risk**

The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and capital
expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin.

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The mandate requires the achievement of a competitive return and high liquidity as regards the placement of
excess liquidity. In order to achieve effective management of the Group’s cash, use is made of cash pooling.

The Group’s liquidity reserves consist of cash.

**Currency risks**

The extent of the Group’s currency risks is limited by the fact that the costs of wages and purchases of supplies
are largely incurred in the same currency as that in which sales are invoiced. Currency risks arise primarily in connection
with international purchases and sales of goods in foreign currencies.

It is the Group’s policy to limit the impact of exchange rate changes on the results and the Group’s financial
position. This is primarily done through currency overdrafts and derivative financial instruments, primarily forward
exchange contracts as may be appropriate. The Group does not engage in speculative currency transactions. The group
did not enter in to any forward currency contracts during the financial year ended 31 July 2017 (2016: None and 2015:
None).

**Interest rate risk**

The Group is due to its operating, investing and financing exposed to changes in interest rates.

The interest rate profile of the Group’s net debt is set out in the following tables:

**29. First time adoption of IFRS**

For the period since its incorporation in 2003 to the year ended 31 July 2005 the Group prepared consolidated
financial statements under the Danish Financial Statements Act. For the financial year ended 31 July 2006 the Group
transitioned to IFRS and prepared consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the
Group stopped preparing consolidated financial statements in the subsequent financial year, following the Group’s
acquisition by Ferguson Plc (‘Ferguson’) in October 2006, as these were no longer required. Since its acquisition by
Ferguson, the Group’s IFRS financial information was prepared and consolidated into the IFRS financial statements of
Ferguson Plc, the Group’s ultimate parent and for a few years for DT Group Holding A/S, the Group’s intermediate
parent.

The Group’s date of transition to IFRS is 1 August 2014.

The Group’s IFRS accounting policies as described in note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial
statements for the year ended 31 July 2017 with two years comparatives for the years ended 31 July 2016 and 2015, and
the opening statement of financial position as at 1 August 2014.

The Group has applied IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (Revised
2008) (“IFRS 1) in preparing these first IFRS financial statements. As the Group did not prepare consolidated financial

F 53

**Stark Group A/S**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

statements under the Danish Financial Statements Act in the most recent previous financial year, no reconciliation of
equity, comprehensive income or cash flows has been presented. As discussed in note 1, the Group prepared
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS in 2006. When applying IFRS 1, the Group has assumed
re-adoption of Danish GAAP in accordance with the then current provisions requiring full retrospective adoption of
Danish GAAP. This has resulted in reinstatement of goodwill as reported in the 2006 IFRS consolidated financial to cost
less cumulative amortisation. Management has determined that the useful life of goodwill under Danish GAAP is equal
to 10 years resulting in full amortisation of goodwill as of 1 August 2014.

_Exemptions applied_

IFRS 1 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain IFRS. The
Group has applied the mandatory exceptions and certain optional exemptions as set out below;

The Group has applied the following exemptions:

1. IFRS 3 Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of subsidiaries, which are considered
businesses for IFRS, or of interests in associates and joint ventures that occurred before 1 August 2014.
Use of this exemption means that the carrying amounts according to the Danish Financial Statements Act
of assets and liabilities, which are required to be recognised under IFRS, is their deemed cost at the date
of the acquisition. After the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance with IFRS. Assets and
liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under IFRS are excluded from the opening IFRS statement of
financial position. The Group did not recognise or exclude any previously recognised amounts as a result
of IFRS recognition requirements.

2. Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero as at
1 August 2014.

3. IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has not been applied to equity instruments granted before 1 January 2011.
For cash-settled share based payment transactions, the Group has not applied IFRS 2 to liabilities that
were settled before 1 January 2011.

4. The Group has applied the transitional provision in IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement
_Contains a Lease and has assessed all arrangements based upon the conditions in place as at the date of_
transition.

_Estimates_

The estimates used by the Group to present these amounts in accordance with IFRS reflect conditions as at the
date of transition to IFRS and as of 31 July 2015, 2016 and 2017.

**30. Subsequent events**

On 10 November 2017, Ferguson Group entered into an agreement to sell Stark Group A/S to a direct subsidiary
of LSF 10 Wolverine Investments S.C.A., a corporate partnership limited by shares and incorporated in Luxembourg for
proceeds of €1.025bn on a debt-free and cash-free basis. LSF 10 Wolverine S.C.A. is an entity indirectly owned by Lone
Star Fund X, the recently established opportunity fund organised by the principals of Lone Star, a leading private equity
firm. This sale is expected to complete in Spring of 2018.

Additionally, and also subsequent to July 31, 2017, properties with a net book value of €86m have been
transferred out of the Stark Group A/S to other Ferguson Group entities as they do not form part of the sale of the Group
to Lone Star.

As set out in note 7, on 10 July 2017 an agreement was reached to sell Silvan to Aurelius Group. The sale of
Silvan concluded on 31 August 2017 for a consideration of €19m.
