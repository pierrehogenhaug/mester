See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing _Arrangements and the Notes—Following the completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will have no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash flows from operating companies to make payments on the Notes.”_ Consequently, no financial information with respect to the Issuer is included in this offering memorandum, except for certain limited “as adjusted” financial data for the Ongoing Business as further adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions as presented in the section entitled “Capitalization.” All historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “group” in respect of any financial information in this offering memorandum are to the Target and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. This offering memorandum includes (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, including the related notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “Audited Financial Statements”); and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2017, including the related notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements” and together with the Audited Financial Statements, the “Financial Statements”).

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the reports of the independent auditors of the Target on the Audited Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgments. These standards require management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in the Audited Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition _and Results of Operations.” The financial statements contained in the F-Pages to this offering memorandum should be_ read in conjunction with the relevant notes thereto. On July 10, 2017, in connection with our strategy to refocus our ongoing business operations primarily on B2B customers, we announced our agreement to divest our DIY brand, Silvan, to Aurelius Group. The sale of Silvan concluded on August 31, 2017. Additionally, we divested our Cheapy chain, a Swedish discount chain, which was sold in April 2014, and Oscar Perschard, a small Norwegian branch, which was sold in July 2014. We include the results of operation, financial position and cash flows from Silvan, Cheapy and Oscar Perschard in our Financial Statements as discontinued operations, which are shown separately from continuing operations in our Financial Statements. In this offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, references to any financial data are only to financial data from continuing operations and exclude the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Silvan, Cheapy and Oscar Perschard. In the future, we will report consolidated financial statements and other information for the Issuer and its subsidiaries prepared under IFRS. The fiscal year of the Issuer ends on July 31 of each calendar year and the first annual consolidated financial statements for the Issuer will be available in respect of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2018. The consolidated financial statements of the Target in this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, the Issuer will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Completion Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our statement of financial position, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brand name, customer relationships, leasehold rights and software. We may also recognize different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Target’s consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum.

The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is presented to illustrate the effects of the Branch Closures and the Property Portfolio Adjustment on the Target’s financial information, as described below. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum as well as the sections entitled “Selected Historical Financial Information” and “Unaudited _Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business.”_ The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is not presented in accordance with IFRS and has been derived by applying certain adjustments to the line items included in the financial information of the Target, which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

In addition, certain other financial information is adjusted to add back amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets, items that management considers to be exceptional and certain other items that management considers to be non-recurring. We present the Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business because we believe that it reflects more closely the Target’s business that will be acquired by Bidco in connection with the Transactions and thus provides additional information on the Target’s historical performance and financial position of the businesses and operations to be acquired. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business reflects the application of adjustments that are based upon available information and certain assumptions, as described above, that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business is presented for informational purposes only. Actual results may differ materially from the assumptions within the accompanying Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information. The Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business has been prepared by management and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions contemplated above as of the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future results of operations that we will experience going forward.

Such Non-IFRS measures are presented based on information derived from our Financial Statements and our historical accounting records and based on the Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business.

For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (“MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive.

To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced by us in this offering memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.

In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, management estimates that we generated approximately 60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from RMI activities and approximately 40% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from new build activity. Our resilient cash flow during our last three years has also benefitted from our stable gross margin, variable cost structure and effective working capital management. Our variable cost structure has allowed us to reduce labor costs, unwind working capital and reduce capital expenditures during the most recent economic downturn. 1 ----- In each of our markets, we seek to offer our customers a broad range of branded and own brand products, consisting of heavy building materials, timber and panels, tools and hardware, flooring and joinery, light-side and other products.

As of October 31, 2017, our own brand portfolio comprised 4,110 SKUs spread across our four brands, Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics. We believe we are well-positioned to have the widest own brand offering in the Nordics as a result of our size, scale and level of coordination across countries. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we derived approximately 91% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from branded products and approximately 9% from our own brand products. We support our 179 strategically located branches through our extensive logistics platform, which includes five ship hubs, one light-side hub, five central distribution centers, approximately 120 delivery trucks that we directly operate and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs, allowing for proximity to our customers and harmonized delivery capabilities across the Nordics. Leveraging our broad physical footprint, we offer our customers three distinct sales channels: stock collected by customers inside our branches, stock delivered by us to our customers from our facilities, including weekday delivery within 24 hours in Denmark, and direct delivery by us to customers from the manufacturer’s facilities. To maximize accessibility of our products across all of our markets, we also support our operations through a variety of digitalized customer services under our online sales platforms, including online and mobile phone order, product search and price comparison capabilities. In the year ended July 31, 2017, after our CEO, Søren P. Olesen, stepped into the role of Group-wide CEO from his previous position with STARK DK, we implemented our “Back to Basics” strategy which comprises a number of strategic initiatives to refocus our business on our core SME customer group, reduce sourcing and operational costs, build a more efficient branch and logistics network and streamline our leadership structure by enhancing local decision making and accountability. Management estimates that these programs, together with improvements in the market, have already had a positive effect on our revenue and earnings during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017. As of October 31, 2017, we had 5,056 FTEs and a total headcount of 5,667 personnel, and in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue for the Ongoing Business of €2,183 million and Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business of €109 million, and achieved a Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Ongoing Business of 5%.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Additionally, the Nordic construction materials distribution market is expected to benefit from a number of sector-specific trends which are expected to outperform the general construction and renovation market, according to a leading management consulting firm.

517,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Nordic market exhibited strong resilient RMI growth even through economic downturn,9.8.2,Competitive Advantages,"We believe our scale, branch network, logistics platform, full ownership structure and broad customer-centric product and service offering harmonized across the Nordics create competitive advantages and provide us with significant operational advantages compared to our competitors. Our business benefits from an extensive network of 179 branches across the Nordics that are strategically located in areas with high population density and limited available additional real estate, making it difficult for potential competitors to replicate our footprint and customer reach in our core markets. Additionally, operating a company-owned network of branches allows us to harmonize our product assortment and manage our product availability across our business, resulting in superior product assortment and availability in branches and via delivery while simultaneously enabling optimized working capital levels. For instance, STARK DK promises product availability on a certain core range of approximately 1,000 SKUs, which if not available in-branch, will be delivered to our customers in Denmark within four hours and free of charge. Leveraging our scale, we also benefit from significant harmonized sourcing capabilities across the Nordics which allow us to streamline our sourcing efforts and negotiate better pricing terms with our suppliers. We are thus able to provide better pricing to our customers and optimize cost to serve to improve our competitiveness in the market. In addition to our branch network, we fully control an extensive logistics platform consisting of five ship hubs, one light-side hub, five central distribution centers, approximately 120 delivery trucks that we directly operate and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs, which allows for proximity to our customers and enables us to meet our customers’ demand for flexible collection and delivery services on a national and cross-regional basis. As of 4 ----- October 31, 2017, we had a deep and loyal customer base of approximately 29,000 active customers, which we define as customers who have spent more than €5,000 on our products and services in the year ended July 31, 2017. As of October 31, 2017, we support our customers with a dedicated sales force of more than 850 employees, excluding branch sales staff and office sales support staff, as well as tailored post-sale service offerings, such as credit accounts. We believe that operating a company-owned network of branches allows us to share best customer service practice across branches and provides our customers with consistently high service. Additionally, we believe that we face only a limited threat from pure-play online retailers who lack the physical store footprint to provide the in-person specialist advice that is important to our customers in their purchasing decisions as well as the special infrastructure required to deliver heavy-side building materials, which make up a significant portion of the products we sell. Heavy building materials and timber and panels possess low value to weight ratios, which have historically proved to be unprofitable for pure-play online retailers. We also believe that pure-play online retailers are unable to meet our customers’ requirement for personalized relationships and post-sale services, including our ability to offer customers individualized pricing options and sales discounts, customer credit options, complex logistics solutions, in-branch advice, in-person technical support and quicker access to products, maintenance services and replacement products.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Collectively, this diversification provides downside protection in times of cyclicality and thus comprises key drivers of resilience of our business. We have established strong, long-lasting relationships with a wide range of customers, including SMEs, which comprise our core customer group, as well as large construction companies, private consumers and other types of customers, such as public authorities. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top 20 customers only generated approximately 7% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 3% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business, with the remaining approximately 93% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 97% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business being generated by a long tail of customers, including SME customers for whom STARK Group is a critical supplier. Our fragmented customer base is further diversified in that both small and large customers often have a variety of product preferences and requirements, purchasing from multiple product categories, frequently and in small quantities, making our role as a “one stop shop” for our core customer groups particularly important. In addition to low customer concentration, our business benefits from a diversified mix of sales channels designed to maximize the accessibility of our products, including: (i) stock collected by customers inside our branches, (ii) stock delivered by us to our customers from our facilities, and (iii) direct delivery by us to customers from the manufacturer’s facilities. In the year ended July 31, 2017, we generated approximately 38%, 29% and 33% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 60%, 27% and 13% of total gross margin for the Ongoing Business from our stock collected, stock delivered and direct delivery channels, respectively. Furthermore, our business benefits from geographic diversification, which enables us to capitalize on the different macroeconomic growth drivers of our core markets of Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway. As the different growth drivers experience peaks and troughs at different times, our business benefits from more stable through-the-cycle revenue generation. In addition, as the Nordic region as a whole may experience a separate economic cycle, our business benefits from resistance to national economic cycles, which is a stabilizing factor with respect to our revenue. Lastly, we are exposed to a diverse supplier base and are not dependent on a single supplier for the operation of our business. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top ten suppliers, excluding unmapped suppliers, accounted for approximately 28% of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business, with no one supplier accounting for 10% or more of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Given the large portion of owned branches, our business benefits from low impact from rent expenses on our cash flow when compared to our competitors across Europe as we do not have a fixed monthly cash outflow with respect to such rent expenses. In the year ended July 31, 2017, management estimates that external rent accounted for only 14% of our EBITDA for the Ongoing Business. By contrast, external rent represented approximately 20% and 37% of EBITDA for Ahlsell and Byggmax, respectively, during each of their 2016 financial years. In addition, as a result of our owned property portfolio, a large portion of our capital expenditures is discretionary as we can generally decide the timing of any improvements to such properties, and we have historically had the flexibility to reduce our capital expenditures during economic downturns.

Our fixed costs mainly relate to the fixed portion of our employee costs, including our base employee and pension costs, administrative expenses and other fixed costs, such as costs related to IT functions.

See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key _Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Cost Saving and Other Strategic Initiatives.”_ We estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate cost savings of approximately €7 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 through our “Back to Basics” strategy, mainly as a result of better contractual terms following our renegotiation of key supply contracts and as a result of headcount reductions and a more streamlined headquarters if these cost saving measures had been implemented on November 1, 2016. Overall, we have identified approximately €74 million in operational, sourcing- and network-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which we aim to realize by 2021. Additionally, we have initiated several topline growth initiatives, primarily related to product assortment, availability and pricing, which management believes, together with improvements in the market, have resulted in an increase in revenue for the Ongoing Business of approximately 5% during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017. We believe that our operational improvements have allowed us to outperform the market in each of Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway in the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

517,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.15,Our Strategy,9.15.1,Better Sourcing,"To reach our objective of developing better sourcing processes, we are implementing a systematic review of our supply chain operations by focusing on three key components: (i) our own brand products, (ii) our direct sourcing costs and (iii) our indirect sourcing costs. We have already begun to implement several initiatives in connection with these key components, the results of which we expect will positively impact our financial position in the near term. 8 ----- Historically, there was a lack of focus on our own brand product portfolio and an excessive overlap of our own brand product proposition with our branded product proposition, with the vast majority of our own brand SKUs not being shared across our business units. By increasing our focus on own brand products, we intend to increase leverage with our suppliers and continue supporting our margins, as own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on average than branded SKUs, according to management estimates. As of October 31, 2017, our own brand portfolio comprised 4,110 SKUs spread across our four brands: Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics. We are currently building a strategic common core range of 800 own brand SKUs which will have reduced overlap with our branded products portfolio. Furthermore, following our disposal of our Silvan DIY business and in line with refocusing our business on our SME core customer group, we will continue to reduce the number of our DIY SKUs. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we derived approximately 9% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from own brand products. Based on independent market studies, we estimate that own brand products will double their share of the relevant market in the Nordics by 2020, and in line with this estimated growth, we aim to more than double the share of our revenue generated by our own brand products. Historically, there was a lack of focus on our direct sourcing costs, including as our business units each defined product categories independently and entered into individualized Nordic framework agreements with suppliers. As a result, we only took limited advantage of bundling purchases from suppliers across business units to achieve volume discounts and partially utilized our eSourcing tool, which aims to optimize efficiency and decrease our sourcing spend through various internet-enabled sourcing methods to reduce the time spent on in-person price negotiations, collect pricing data easily and enable high competition among suppliers. In addition, we previously did not track key performance indicators consistently across business units, preventing us from adequately monitoring and driving performance. Consequently, we believe there is significant potential for savings with respect to our direct sourcing costs, and under our “Back to Basics” strategy, we intend to decrease our direct sourcing costs by better leveraging our position as the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics, while building longer term relationships with key suppliers to further reduce costs and ensure the quality and security of the supply for a number of our key products. On August 1, 2017, we launched STARK Group Sourcing, our harmonized sourcing unit across the Nordics, which is designed to maximize sourcing synergies between our business units through a three-step process of (i) rationalizing our suppliers, (ii) rationalizing our product assortment and common core range of SKUs and (iii) improving payment terms with suppliers. We believe STARK Group Sourcing will enable us to benefit from significant economies of scale. Leveraging a “one door” decision making policy, our sourcing unit will continue to conduct best practice and fact-based negotiations with suppliers under direct sourcing campaigns, with the aim of further reducing costs and increasing efficiencies. Historically, there was a lack of focus on our indirect sourcing costs, leading to decentralized sourcing processes and unexploited cost saving opportunities in key indirect sourcing areas such as marketing and logistics, IT and facility management. As part of our “Back to Basics” strategy, we have identified initiatives which we believe will reduce our indirect sourcing costs with minimal effort. Such initiatives include continuing to streamline our supplier base, creating performance-based supplier contracts and improving the management of demand for our products and supplies. We have identified approximately €51 million of sourcing and procurement-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

In line with our “Back to Basics” strategic plan, we will continue optimizing the footprint of our branches to capture the benefit of expected growth in the markets in coming years and increase our competitive advantages. We aim to increase the accessibility of our branches through facility improvements which are tailored to the needs of our customers and trends in our markets and aimed to provide consistent and positive customer shopping experiences. While our business benefits significantly from our current geographic coverage, we may in the future pursue strategic relocations and consolidations of certain branches to better locations along highly travelled roads benefiting from higher footfall or visibility and will assess any new branches that we bring into our network on a case-by-case basis. We continue to monitor our existing branch base to selectively close or merge branches that are performing poorly or otherwise do not meet our expectations. To pursue cost saving opportunities, we have identified several measures which we intend to action in the short term. For instance, we aim to further simplify our distribution network while optimizing our delivery routes and pricing 9 ----- terms by, among other things, establishing additional ship hubs, developing our recently established light-side hub in Denmark to streamline the distribution of slow moving items, downsizing and outsourcing certain of our centralized warehouse processes to achieve cost savings and consolidating the number of dedicated branches used for the distribution of products to better allocate our resources.

With respect to such trade-specific “high runner” products, we aim to improve our smart pricing strategy to maintain a reputable value perception among our customers and to simultaneously drive movement in inventory and revenue.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain future indebtedness and obligations, including Pension-related Obligations, permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes, following the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security interests. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the relevant security unless instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). The relevant Instructing Group or such other class of creditors as specified by the Intercreditor Agreement may, under certain conditions, be entitled to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the relevant security subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

We calculate EBITDA for the Ongoing Business as historical profit for the period before financial income, financial expenses, tax for the period, depreciation and amortization excluding the impact on operating profit resulting from the Branch Closures, as described in “Presentation of Financial and Other _Data” and “Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business.” We believe EBITDA for the Ongoing Business is a useful_ financial metric for assessing operating performance. We believe that it also facilitates comparison between us and our competitors. We define Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business as EBITDA for the Ongoing Business before exceptional items related to the Ongoing Business and the Ferguson Group management fee, which reflect historical charges to us of Ferguson Group-related functions and services, such as finance and treasury support and oversight, which we believe will no longer be indicative of our financial performance following the Acquisition Completion Date. As such, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business provides investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability of our core business between periods because it excludes certain items that do not reflect the ongoing performance of our business. EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business are Non-IFRS Measures and the use of these measures has certain limitations. Our presentation of EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The terms EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business are not defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles, and EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business are not measures of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. We calculate Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business as Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business adjusted for (a) certain estimated costs that we will incur as a stand-alone business following the Acquisition Completion Date to replicate services previously provided to us as part of Ferguson Group, such as treasury services, insurance policies and share-based incentive payments which used to be covered by Ferguson’s share plan, and (b) the annualized results from certain costs savings and other performance improvement initiatives that we implemented during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 as if we had implemented such cost savings and performance improvement initiatives on November 1, 2016. Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business is subject to the same limitations as EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business. Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any historical or future period. Our presentation of Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In evaluating Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, you should be aware that, as an analytical tool, it is subject to certain limitations. In particular, run-rate cost savings and performance improvement are based on management estimates and assumptions and are forward looking in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives for the period presented and may not be comparable with our Financial Statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum, and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. 26 ----- The following table provides a reconciliation of our historical profit for the period to EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business and Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, respectively, for the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

The level of new build activities and, to a lesser extent, RMI activities tends to be cyclical and is dependent on the prevailing economic climate, including, among other things, GDP growth, unemployment levels, salaries (including minimum wages), the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence, demographic developments, immigration levels and consumer perception of economic conditions as well as the level of construction- and renovation-related expenditures in the residential and non-residential sectors, public and private spending on infrastructure projects and public investments. Decelerating economic growth in certain major global cities and concerns regarding the extent of such deceleration may also have an impact on the global economic outlook and increase volatility in the markets, including the construction materials distribution markets in which we operate, and thus indirectly have a negative impact on demand for some of our products. Due to the cyclicality of certain of the end-markets we serve, in particular the new build sector of the construction materials distribution industry, our future sales and sales margins will vary and, consequently, our profitability and absolute profit levels will also fluctuate. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, management estimates RMI projects accounted for approximately 60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business, and new build projects accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business in the same period. During an economic downturn or in periods of low economic growth, end-users may hire commercial builders less frequently, and as a result B2B customers may buy less of our products, as consumers seek to increase savings and postpone cost-intensive new build projects and, to a lesser extent, RMI projects. Revenue generated by our customers’ propensity toward new build activities has historically and recently been more susceptible to cyclicality than RMI activities. New build activities in Denmark today, for example, remain approximately 33% below peak levels, according to Euroconstruct. Consequently, during periods of economic downturn or low economic growth, we have recorded, and may continue to record, lower sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

We face, and will continue to face, competition from local, regional, national and international B2B building materials suppliers, manufacturers and distributors, as well as from privately owned single-site retailers. Competition in the B2B construction materials distribution industry is subject to a number of variables, including convenience of location, product availability and range, delivery services, pricing strategies, customer service, availability of credit, technical product knowledge with respect to application and usage and advisory capabilities. Currently, our major competitors are XL Byg, Optimera, Bygma, S-Ryhmä, Woody, Byggmakker, Kesko and Maxbo. Any of these competitors may predict the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to our products, have the ability to produce or supply similar products at a lower cost, develop stronger relationships with professional homebuilders or commercial builders, adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or have access to financing on more favorable terms than we can obtain. We also face competition from European operators of large superstores, some of which may expand into the Nordics either through organic growth or by acquiring smaller builders’ merchants with an existing market share in the 29 ----- Nordics. Large competitors could use economies of scale to their advantage, and may be able to, among other things, purchase inventory and/or sell products at lower prices, make substantial marketing expenditures or offer a superior in-branch experience compared to our branches. Actions taken by competitors, as well as actions taken by us to maintain competitiveness and a reputation for value for money, have placed, and may continue to place, pressure on product pricing, gross margins and profitability. Furthermore, some of our competitors, including both B2B builders’ merchants and general retailers may be able to negotiate better contracts with major suppliers, acquire business real estate at better locations or devote greater resources to advertising and marketing campaigns to procure new customers. Additionally, we face competition from our larger suppliers. Such suppliers may supply their products directly to the B2B customers that comprise our target market, including organizing distribution and logistics themselves. Alternatively, such suppliers may agree to supply directly to our customers, with our business providing an invoice service only. As a result, we may experience fewer volumes sold to our customers, lost volume bonuses for our purchases from suppliers, lost margins and in the case of invoice servicing, continued legal and contractual risk for the products delivered. Suppliers may also elect to enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with our competitors. Any of these conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, our customers, particularly B2B customers, have historically exerted and will continue to exert pressure on our and their other suppliers to keep prices low because of their market share and their ability to leverage such market share in the highly fragmented construction materials distribution industry. Moreover, consolidation among B2B customers, and changes in their purchasing policies or payment practices, may result in increased competition for their business and consequently additional pricing pressure, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We may not be able to effectively compete with competitors, which could threaten our market position in the markets in which we operate, and negatively affect our levels of sales and profit margins. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment in, among other things, refurbishing our branches, sourcing and developing new products and maintaining and developing our digital capability, our logistics network and our offering, including our supplier base, sales channels, sales and marketing capabilities and customer relationships. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in product developments, local population demographics and customer and end-user preferences, expectations and needs, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. Demand in the B2B construction materials distribution industry may be affected by, for example, demographic trends among end-users, such as aging and declining populations, changes in the average number of persons living in one household, the increasing average living space per capita or migration trends. As a result, we must offer a sufficient range of products to satisfy varying customer and end-user preferences and demographics. Our competitors may offer a more compelling product mix or may stock a greater number of SKUs, including for substitutes for our products that may be or become more popular or may be perceived as having superior characteristics. We also must be able to train our in-branch personnel to understand new products, some of which are technologically complex, and sell those products to our customers. We may not be able to accurately predict customer and end-user preferences or demand for certain products, and some of our products may be rendered obsolete because of developments in technology. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing trends or misjudge the market, customer demand or consumer preferences and demographics, our revenue may decline and we may have a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed sales opportunities. In response, we may be forced to rely on promotional activities to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory. We may spend substantial sums developing products with our suppliers, or we may enter into minimum purchase contracts with suppliers for goods, which may exacerbate losses if those products are not successful. In contrast, in the event that certain products are more successful than anticipated, we may need to restock initial inventories at one or more of our locations. Despite our robust supply chain, we may not be able to replenish a particular branch that has reduced stock and we may therefore end up with insufficient inventory at particular locations. Such an inventory shortage might result in unfilled orders and lost revenue. Any failure to adequately address customer and consumer preferences and properly maintain inventory levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 30 ----- Customer expectations about the methods they use to purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. Customers now routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products, which could make our traditional branchbased or phone-based operations less appealing. Once products are purchased through any of these channels, customers are demanding convenient options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick and low-cost delivery. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchase and delivery process, including with respect to pricing trends, which are made more visible with online price comparison capabilities, as well as existing and new competitors, who may be able to provide lower prices, greater choice and/or superior convenience through their online sales platforms. Our ability to strategically improve our online sales platforms to support our traditional branch-based sales also depends on a number of other factors, including our ability to successfully market our websites, the hiring, training and retention of qualified IT personnel and the compatibility of our websites with newer customer devices. Growing our online sales platforms will result in increased reliance on information technology, the interruption or failure of which could adversely affect our business. Performance issues with these customer facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or cyber attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could negatively affect business and harm our reputation or our customers’ perceptions of us. Furthermore, we have a branch network that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. We must also maintain a safe branch environment for our customers and associates. If we cannot maintain the standards at our branches and utilize our branch space effectively, timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and construction and renovation needs, positively differentiate the customer experience for our main customer groups from our competitors or effectively implement a comprehensive and compelling merchandising assortment, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share, could each be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Generally, in stable or strong housing markets, sales of building material products benefit from housing moves and renovations undertaken by end-users. However, in a weaker housing market, factors such as tighter restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing, slower household formation growth rates, lower existing home sales, reduction in government incentives and falling home prices may limit consumers’ propensity to move or build houses or undertake discretionary renovations on existing properties either themselves or through a professional, which could result in a decreased demand for building materials. Accordingly, weak housing markets in the countries in which we operate may result in a decrease in sales of our building material products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the construction and renovation industry is subject to various local, national and regional statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, renovation, energy and water conservation and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area or in order to maintain certain areas as primarily or exclusively residential. Regulatory restrictions may increase our operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for B2B customers and B2C customers, which could negatively affect our sales and earnings. In addition, building codes may affect the products that B2B customers and B2C customers are permitted to use, and consequently, changes in building codes may affect the saleability and marketability of our products. Moreover, the demand for our products and services is impacted by monetary and fiscal policies in each of the countries in which we operate. This includes policies that have the effect of encouraging or discouraging construction and renovation, such as long-term interest rates, tax policies such as tax reduction for repairs, conversion and extension (“ROT”), policies encouraging or discouraging labor mobility and migration, availability of financing or subsidies, the allocation of government funding for public infrastructure programs, and safety regulations that encourage or discourage the use of certain materials and products. Interest rate changes, for example, affect demand for residential and non-residential structures, which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities. Interest rate changes could also affect the ability of B2B customers and B2C customers to finance purchases. In addition to changing interest rates, central banks and other policy terms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. Changes in liquidity and credit policies, including the reduction or elimination of favorable tax or other stimulus programs, could adversely impact our customers, markets and suppliers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 31 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is integral to the success of our business and to the implementation of our business plans. Our maintenance, promotion and positioning of our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts, and our ability to provide good customer experiences. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if negative publicity tarnishes our public image or reputation. Our brand image may be diminished if we fail to maintain high standards for, among other things, the timely and efficient delivery of quality products and an after-sales service, if we fail to maintain high social and environmental standards for all our operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience other negative events that affect our image or reputation. Moreover, other factors that we may be unable to control could tarnish our reputation, such as any safety issues with our products due to the fault of the supplier and any resulting product liability claims against us. In addition, the widespread use of social media by customers and consumers, including blogging and use of and feedback about our business or products on social media activities can negatively affect our business, as criticism in blogs, forums and on social media, and regardless of whether such criticism is based on facts, may rapidly spread online and may damage our reputation and our brand. These platforms also could be used for the dissemination of trade secret information or compromise other valuable company assets, any of which could harm our business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Any failure to maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we sell our own brand products through our own four brands, Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics, which each represent an important asset of our business. Maintaining the reputation of and value associated with these own brand names are central to our success. Certain of our policies, including our pricing policies and our expansion policies, could damage our reputation and the value associated with our own brand names and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We believe our own brand products offer potentially significant commercial opportunities and we are investing in these brands and related supply and distribution networks, but there can be no assurance that these brands will generate sufficient sales volumes and customer demand to match our expected long-term return on investment. We may have to further develop, improve and expand our own brand product portfolio and services in the future, for example by entering new end-user markets and adapting our products to new applications and regulatory or customer requirements. Our success in meeting our customers’ needs and expectations is dependent on various factors, such as market research, a well-developed understanding of the strategies and requirements of customers new to our business, the right positioning in markets new to us or of our new products and technologies, as well as the ability to research, develop and offer new or improved products and technologies at competitive terms. If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of our own brand products, our reputation may be diminished, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, as we seek to expand our own brand product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility for administering and complying with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. In addition, to effectively execute our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. Furthermore, an increase in sales of our own brand products may adversely affect sales of certain of our suppliers’ branded products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers.

Although we or the injured party in question are able to make a claim against the supplier in the case of product defects or warranty events, if the supplier defaults on their obligations, we may bear a portion of, and in some cases the primary risk of, product liability and warranty claims. The reputation of our brand could be damaged by the marketing of defective products, especially in the event of serious defects such as products containing harmful substances causing 32 ----- physical harm or other health problems. Such serious defects could also lead to a significant decline in sales. In addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by our suppliers could occur which could lead to investigations by agencies responsible for international trade, health and safety or modern slavery compliance.

In all such cases, especially if there is a prolonged impact on product quality, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if products that we purchase from suppliers are damaged or prove to be defective, we may not be able to return products to these suppliers and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain other indemnification from them. Our suppliers’ limited capacities may result in a supplier’s inability to replace any defective merchandise in a timely manner, especially during peak selling seasons.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively optimize our operational efficiency. We will seek to realize significant cost savings in procurement, inbound and outbound logistics, centralized functions, inventory range and management, size of our workforce, headquarters size and functions and information technology. In order to realize these cost savings, we expect to incur material expenditures, which may be higher than our estimated amount. Our anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement our cost saving measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Furthermore, our ability to achieve the planned cost savings is dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. We may be unable to achieve these anticipated cost savings in a timely manner, if at all. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these cost saving programs proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time frame, the expected benefits from our cost saving measures. We may have to replace headcount in certain areas of our workforce which might cost more than the current workforce and lead to a delay in execution capability while the replacement workforce is recruited and integrated. Furthermore, pricing pressure from our customers or competitors or other variables may deprive us of some of the anticipated long-term benefits from our cost saving programs. Our new business initiatives could result in unintended consequences, such as the loss of customers and key suppliers, a reduction in administrative or operational capabilities or collective action by our workers.

These projects are intended to transform our infrastructure and data systems, increase our cost efficiency gains and optimize our supply chain operations and our branch network. Strategic projects are often complicated, interlinked and require considerable resources to deliver them. As a result, the expected benefits and the costs of implementation of each project may deviate from those anticipated at their outset, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. If our strategic projects are not successful, or require extensive investment, we may be unable to achieve or maintain expected levels of profitability. Our strategy depends in part on continually growing our sales and increasing our market share through the optimization of our branch network. As we pursue strategic acquisitions, failure to identify, acquire and integrate suitable acquisition candidates on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on such growth strategy. We also cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to secure high quality real estate to add to our freehold portfolio on terms and timelines acceptable to us. If our competitors are able to secure such sites, they may be able to increase their market share in these areas and consequently restrict our ability to expand. Additionally, we may experience difficulties securing new business space or refurbishing our existing branches due to regulatory measures, such as approvals from regional or local planning authorities. Although we prepare investments in our branches on the basis of detailed market research analyses which examine, among other criteria, catchment area, 33 ----- purchasing power, potential demand and competition, we may still face the risk of unsatisfactory sales performance at our branches. Our market research analysis may prove to be inadequate, particularly due to factors that are difficult to predict, such as customer behavior, or the data available may prove to be insufficient, such as in periods when market conditions are changing. We cannot guarantee that any investments in our branches will yield the anticipated returns. Our failure to build or refurbish our facilities, including branches, hubs and distribution centers, and meet customer demand in a timely manner could result in a loss of business opportunities and damage to or loss of customer relationships, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the opening of new branches, refurbishing of certain existing branches or integration of acquired businesses will exclude the possibility of the diverting of sales from other of our existing branches, thereby reducing sales in those branches. The growth and refurbishment of our branch network could place a strain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources. In addition, such growth and refurbishment may prevent management from having time to focus on their day to day activities. Any failure, or delay, in responding to these challenges or in implementing our expansion strategy in a timely and cost effective manner could prevent us from remaining competitive and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

In addition, our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our employees. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers and of the growth of our business, we must attract, train and retain a large number of qualified and competent employees while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage or healthcare benefits. If we are not successful in limiting such increases in labor costs or fail to mitigate such increases through productivity gains or if cost increases cannot be passed on to our customers or only with a delay, this might have significant negative effects on our financial condition and results of operations.

These activities generally decrease during periods of inclement weather, and, as a result, our operations can be characterized by weather-affected fluctuations in demand. Our revenue and net working capital generally reflect seasonality in the building sector, and our most important trading period in terms of revenue, operating results and cash flow has historically been in our first and fourth financial quarters as a result of increased new build and RMI activity during warmer periods with longer daylight hours, among other things. In the winter months, we typically generate less revenue due to low construction and renovation activity as a result of cold weather, partially offset by an increase in indoor activities such as painting. Additionally, our results of operations are affected by generally consistent seasonal swings in our net working capital. Typically, we experience a cash outflow in the winter months as we tend to incur additional expenses in advance of our peak sales periods that occur during our first and fourth financial quarters. We typically experience a cash inflow in the summer and early fall as we finalize collecting payments from customers who have made purchases for their spring construction and renovation projects simultaneously as we begin collecting payments from customers who are making purchases for their summer and early fall construction and renovation projects. As a result of the seasonal nature of parts of our business, the financial results of a single financial quarter may not be indicative of the financial results of a full financial year or may not be directly comparable with the results of other financial quarters in the same year or in previous years. In addition, with respect to swings in our working capital, from time to time our existing working capital financing may not be sufficient to meet our obligations, and we may be required to either limit our business operations or obtain additional working capital financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing at attractive rates or at all, or may be restricted under our existing debt instruments in obtaining such financing. Any such inability to finance our net working capital requirements could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 35 ----- Furthermore, climate change or changes in weather patterns could lead to the occurrence of more extreme weather events or increase the frequency of extreme weather events in the future. Such adverse weather conditions could increase the effects of seasonality on our business, especially if such events occurred frequently or for a prolonged period of time, with an unusual intensity or during peak periods for RMI activities and new build activities.

We transport products between our hubs, distribution centers and branches and deliver products to our customers, relying on approximately 120 delivery trucks that we directly operate and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs. Any material disruption in, or lack of availability of, transportation or significant increases in fuel prices, road tolls or demand-driven market prices resulting in higher transportation costs, as well as increasing costs relating to emissions control requirements that have been or may be imposed in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In cases where we rely on third party-owned delivery trucks, our ability to service our customers at commercially reasonable costs depends on our ability to negotiate commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that third party-owned delivery trucks increase their rates, for example, as a result of higher labor, maintenance, fuel or other costs they may incur, or due to other factors, such as capacity shortages or consolidations, we may be forced to pay such increased rates without being able to pass through such increased transportation costs to our customers. In addition, we are sometimes required to source products internationally, and in such cases we may be subject to higher transport costs and may face a greater threat of damage to our products during shipping, either of which may have a negative impact on our inventory costs and working capital. Any material increases in our transportation costs that we are unable to pass on to customers fully or in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Furthermore, pursuant to our expansion strategy, we intend to open additional facilities, which may increase our exposure to logistics costs and risks.

The prices of many of these materials are volatile and set by international commodities markets. For example, prices of wood products, including timber and panel products, are subject to significant volatility and directly affect our sales and earnings as we have limited ability to manage the timing and amount of pricing changes for building products. If we or our suppliers face increasing purchase prices for those materials, the prices we pay to purchase inventory may increase. Suppliers normally seek to pass increased raw materials costs through to us, and may be able to do so depending on our ability to obtain alternative supplies. In addition, the supply of building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity. A shortage of capacity or excess capacity in the industry can result in significant increases or declines in prices for those products, often within a short period of time. If our suppliers are forced to close their manufacturing plants or we are otherwise reliant on a more concentrated number of suppliers, we may experience higher prices for our supplies and lower margins for our products. While we have historically been able to pass increased costs on to customers, sometimes through contractual terms, we may be prevented from doing so in the future due to competition, the need to uphold good customer relationships or other factors. Any increase in the prices at which we purchase our inventory, particularly those exacerbated by lower margins on the products we sell, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Furthermore, higher prices for products involving fuel-intensive manufacturing and transportation processes could also lead to an increase in the overall procurement costs for the finished products we stock. Increases in fuel prices also affect the operating costs of our branch network and may only be offset to a limited degree through cost-saving measures. If we are unable to pass on such costs to our customers, or only following a certain delay, we may face declining margins. As we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with our customers generally, our attempt to pass through higher raw material or other costs to them may lead to disruptions in such relationships or significant decreases in the volume of products purchased, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 36 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability to operate our branches or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact customer or consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. To the extent that such events were to result in a decrease in housing starts, the closure of one or more of our branches or impair our ability to purchase, receive or replenish inventory, our operations and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. In particular, acts of terrorism could result in us experiencing a decline in our revenue if customers are deterred from shopping in general or if one or more of our branches, due to their location, are perceived to be particularly at risk from such acts of terrorism. In addition, any of these events could result in price increases for, or shortages of, fuel, delays in opening new branches, and/or a temporary or long-term disruption to our supply chain and ability to distribute products to our customers.

Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers and manufacturers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. We believe that there are a limited number of reliable, high quality suppliers in the industry who are prepared to provide a sufficient volume and quantity of products, and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative agreements or arrangements in the future with suppliers, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Some of our supplier contracts, for example, offer us better pricing depending on the quantity of supplies we purchase from them. Any disputes with our preferred suppliers could limit our ability to maintain our quality standards and meet customer demand for our products at favorable prices. If our existing suppliers were unable or unwilling to continue to supply our needs, or if they were to be willing to do so only at higher prices or on commercially unfavorable terms, our ability to provide materials, products and services to our customers at competitive prices will be adversely affected. For example, our ability to obtain an adequate volume and quality of timber, for example, could be affected by, among other things, forest fires, insect infestation, tree diseases, prolonged drought, other adverse weather and climate conditions, and government regulations relating to forest management practices, each of which may threaten our suppliers’ ability to perform their contractual obligations to us. Since we may be unable to procure such materials and products elsewhere at short notice, we may experience supply delays, and we may be forced to revise the terms, including the price, on which we supply products to our customers, which could prompt our customers to purchase those products from our competitors. Additionally, if we become reliant on a more concentrated number of suppliers for such materials, we may experience higher prices for our supplies and lower margins for our products. We have framework agreements in place with the majority of our suppliers and standard terms and conditions in place for most other suppliers. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, approximately 17% of our sourcing spend was incurred without a framework agreement in place. Where we have agreements in place, such agreements do not usually contain minimum purchase or sales obligations for either party and may be terminable by either party on limited notice.

See “Business—Legal _Proceedings.” For example, on September 13, 2017, STARK DK was charged with an alleged bribery offense under the_ Danish criminal code relating to the payment in 2013 of DKK10,000 (approximately €1,500) by a former branch manager of one of STARK DK’s Aarhus branches to a local badminton club at which a leading employee of Aarhus municipality was a board member. The charges allege that STARK DK was hired as one of Aarhus municipality’s suppliers in return for such payment. The branch manager in question as well as his direct supervisor left STARK Group in 2015. According to the information currently available, it is our view that management of STARK DK, at the time of the payment, was not aware of the former branch manager’s activities. Under Danish criminal law, in order to be liable, STARK DK’s management at the time of the payment must have been aware of and sanctioned the activity of the former branch manager. STARK DK is fully cooperating with the local police on this matter and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. In case of a conviction, STARK DK could be liable to pay a fine. While management currently believes that the chances of a conviction of STARK DK are low, we cannot guarantee you that the case against STARK DK will be dropped. Should STARK DK be convicted of the alleged bribery offense, we could be required to pay a fine and our reputation may be harmed. We have been advised by external counsel that if a fine were levied, such external counsel would not expect the fine to be more than the DKK10,000 in question. Legal proceedings in which we may be involved, whether individually or in the aggregate, could involve substantial claims for damages or other payments and, even if we successfully dispose of lawsuits without direct adverse financial effect, such alleged claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and divert our financial and management resources from more beneficial uses.

The efficient operation and management of our business relies heavily on a wide range of complex IT systems, both in terms of the availability of hardware and the efficient and effective operation of software. The fast pace of technology advances together with our expansion has resulted in an increasing demand for IT services, particularly as we develop new capabilities to supply products through new channels such as phone and online based ordering. We rely upon our information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, and to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services. Any significant disruption to the operations of our IT systems (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages, or delays in our service) could significantly affect our ability to carry out sales transactions in-branch, over the phone and online and could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar disruptions affecting internet users. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or associated costs and resulting loss in sales from a critical failure of our IT systems will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we currently rely heavily on certain longstanding key IT personnel, and if they leave their position with us or retire, we may not be able to find adequate replacements in a timely manner. The expansion and optimization of our existing operations will from time to time entail significant investments. For example, we currently operate on a number of older IT systems, which may require replacement or significant development and integration in order to support changes in business demand and in legislative requirements. In addition, while we have historically had a fully in-house IT operation setup, we will be moving towards greater reliance on external strategic IT partners. In connection with the Acquisition, we plan to outsource most of our IT services, including, for example, hosting, support functions and application management services.

Such insurance coverage, however, may not fully cover the risks to which we are exposed. This can be the case with insurance covering legal and administrative claims as well as with respect to insurance covering other risks. For certain risks, adequate insurance coverage may not be available on the market at all or may not be available on reasonable commercial terms. Consequently, any harm resulting from the materialization of these risks could result in significant capital expenditures and expenses as well as liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry,13.1.33,We are subject to liabilities in connection with our pension plans.,"Certain of our employees participate in defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. These pension plans expose us to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, salary risk and investment risk. In addition, in respect of contribution plans, changes in actuarial and financial assumptions used in determining the contribution level may require us to increase our pension fund contributions in 2018 and beyond. In addition, in respect of defined benefit plans, the majority of the plans’ defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation and an increase in inflation rates will result in higher pension liabilities. At the same time, the majority of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation rates will also increase plan deficits. The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so that increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. If we are required to increase our cash contributions to the pension scheme, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In Sweden, our Beijer business unit currently participates in collectively bargained defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for its white collar employees. Retirement pensions provided under the defined benefit plan can be financed (i) through insurance contracts with a mutual insurance company, (ii) by accruing a liability for promised benefits on the plan provider’s balance sheet and paying out pensions as these fall due or (iii) by making contributions to an independent pension foundation. In the case of (ii) and (iii), a plan provider is obligated to take out insolvency protection with PRI Pensionsgaranti, a mutually owned credit insurance and administrator of the relevant defined benefit plan. Our Beijer business unit is currently accruing a liability for the promised benefits on its balance sheet, which amounted to €48 million under IFRS as of July 31, 2017. In line with Swedish law requirements, Beijer has taken out a credit insurance policy with PRI Pensionsgaranti. Beijer’s obligations to PRI Pensionsgaranti under the credit insurance policy are guaranteed by Ferguson and secured by a floating charge over Beijer’s assets and business. Ferguson’s guarantee will remain in place until the credit insurance policy is due for renewal in May 2018. In connection with the Transactions, we have contacted PRI Pensionsgaranti and informed them of the anticipated change in ownership of Stark Group. Following the consummation of the Transactions, unless otherwise agreed with them, PRI Pensionsgaranti will remain the holder of the above mentioned floating charge and may also require additional or replacement guarantees from one or more members of the Group, including the Issuer or one or more Guarantors, and/or additional collateral, including over assets and properties constituting Post-Issue Date Collateral. PRI Pensionsgaranti is entitled to cancel the credit insurance policy should they consider that they have not received satisfactory collateral or should Beijer fail to provide additional collateral to PRI Pensionsgaranti’s satisfaction. Upon any cancellation of the credit insurance policy provided by PRI Pensionsgaranti, Beijer would be required to subscribe to a mandatory pension insurance policy with Alecta (the sole provider of the requisite pension insurance policies that could cover Beijer’s pension liability), the cost of which could exceed 150% of the aggregate amount of Beijer’s incurred pension liabilities and will be calculated by Alecta. At the option of the Issuer, collateral and guarantees to PRI Pensionsgaranti, together with any other Pensionrelated Obligations, are permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank senior to our obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. See “—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes— _Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and obligations permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the Notes.

Any future acquisitions, business combinations or joint ventures by us could involve a number of special risks, including: the diversion of management’s attention and resources to the negotiation, execution and assimilation of the acquired companies and their employees and to the management of expanding operations; the incorporation of acquired products into our product lines; problems associated with maintaining relationships with employees, suppliers and customers of acquired businesses; the increasing demands on our operational systems; possible adverse effects on our reported operating results, particularly during the first several reporting periods after such acquisitions are completed; and the loss of key employees and the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image. In addition, we may become liable for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with any future acquisition. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions without substantial costs, delays or other problems, and the costs of such integration could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to control any future joint ventures and therefore may be dependent on our respective joint venture partners to cooperate with us in making decisions regarding the relevant joint venture. From time to time, we also make divestments as part of our strategy. For example, during the year ended July 31, 2017, we divested our DIY brand, Silvan, in order to focus on our core business and customer groups. However, we cannot assure you any divestments we have made or may make in the future will lead to positive growth for our business. Such divestments could result in less revenue, write-downs of goodwill and a lower amount of total assets on our balance sheet. We may encounter unanticipated events, costs or delays and retain or incur contract or legal liabilities related to the divested business with respect to employees, customers, suppliers, independent agents, public authorities or other parties. These divestments may also negatively affect our end-market and customer diversification and our ability to meet our customers’ demand or to realize expected growth or cost savings, and may also increase our exposure to cyclicality. The separation of the divested business may lead to delayed implementation of strategic initiatives of the retained business. In addition, we may also continue to reorganize our branch network as part of our optimization strategy. For example, during the year ended July 31, 2017, we closed 30 underperforming branches in low growth regions. However, we cannot assure you that such branch closures, or any future branch closures, will lead to positive growth for our business. Such branch closures may negatively affect our end-market and customer diversification due to more limited access to our products and services and our ability to meet our customers’ demand or to realize expected growth or cost savings.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations on an ongoing basis. As of October 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had €515 million of outstanding indebtedness, comprising the Notes. In addition, based on our current estimate of our cash flow and operations, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to meet our seasonal working capital requirements. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting _Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.”_ The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to either series of the Notes; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, and limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Furthermore, we experience significant fluctuations in our monthly and intra-month working capital and, following the Acquisition Completion Date, we may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of our working capital requirements. Drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility will vary and may be substantially higher during certain months and weeks to compensate for months with reduced cash reserves. 47 ----- Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture, which could further exacerbate the risks described above. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that with respect to a distressed disposal of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other future indebtedness and obligations permitted under the Indenture, including but not limited to, Pension-related Obligations, have been repaid in full. Additionally, we could raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will restrict, among other things, our ability to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Issuer; - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions; - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries; - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries; - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - consolidate or merge with other entities; - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and - amend certain documents. All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes— _Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and_ capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial test under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet that financial test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. A breach of this test could result in a default or an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay each series of the Notes, in full or in part.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated revenue growth, cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will mature six months prior to the maturity of the Notes. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility can be further increased, assuming we have the ability to incur such additional debt under the restrictive covenants included in the Indenture. See “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of the Notes or any other debt that we may_ incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital-raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt. Any failure to make payments on any series of the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

Fluctuations in EURIBOR, CIBOR, NIBOR, STIBOR or LIBOR, as the case may be, or the occurrence of a “market disruption event” (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) may increase our overall interest burden and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our debt obligations. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of national governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR or EURIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR or EURIBOR. Actions by EURIBOR-EBF (the association that sets the regulatory framework for the calculation of EURIBOR), other regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR or EURIBOR is determined. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR or EURIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt on drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Floating Rate Notes or any future indebtedness that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

As a result, proceeds from the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees and the sale of Collateral may be insufficient to pay claims under the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under each series of the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. The fair market value of the Collateral at any point in time may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. As a result, the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the 51 ----- Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests with respect to the Notes can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security Agent may need to 52 ----- obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may have priority.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became due; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Notes Guarantee, or the granting of the security, was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such Notes Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void the security over the Collateral, or could require the holders of the relevant Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such Notes Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer, any other Guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Notes Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been declared void. Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the pledge or charge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or charge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within a certain time period following the pledge or charge. 56 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Moreover, the Issuer and Bidco are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and Denmark, respectively, the other Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland and the operational headquarters of the Group is located in Denmark. Therefore, in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in these and other applicable jurisdictions. The rights of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer, Bidco and the other Guarantors may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors’ rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. If we repay all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes in an amount over 50% of the principal amount of the Notes in aggregate, we are required under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to reduce the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility proportionately in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control were to occur at a time when our Group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that our Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be deemed not to be a Change of Control if a certain net consolidated leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the “Description _of the Notes” is not exceeded in connection with such an event. In this case holders of Notes would not be entitled to_ require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and would only be able to rely on the then prevailing trading prices in order to exit their investments, which might be lower than the 101% change of control repurchase price. See “Description of 57 ----- _the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Change of Control Triggering Event.”_ The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

We believe that presenting the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and capitalization of the Issuer in this manner is the most meaningful way to present the financial position of the Issuer after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on October 31, 2017, given the Issuer is a holding company formed in connection with the Transactions with no revenue generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations, material assets or liabilities (other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions). The table below should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and Other Data,” “Summary— _Summary Historical Financial Information, Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business and Other Financial Data,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and our Financial Statements_ and related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

On July 10, 2017, in connection with our strategy to refocus our ongoing business operations primarily on B2B customers, we announced our agreement to divest our DIY brand, Silvan, to Aurelius Group. The sale of Silvan concluded on August 31, 2017. Additionally, we divested our Cheapy chain, a Swedish discount chain, which was sold in April 2014, and Oscar Perschard, a small Norwegian branch, which was sold in July 2014. We include the results of operation, financial position and cash flows from Silvan, Cheapy and Oscar Perschard in our Financial Statements as discontinued operations, which are shown separately from continuing operations in our Financial Statements.

We directly operate a total of 179 branches across Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Greenland from which we serve our diversified customer base of small and medium-sized enterprises, which comprise our core customer group, as well as large construction companies, private consumers and other types of customers, such as public authorities. We operate four business units across the Nordics and as of October 31, 2017, we directly operated 66 branches in Denmark, with an additional six branches in Greenland, under our STARK DK business unit, 27 branches in Finland under our STARK FI business unit, 66 branches in Sweden under our Beijer business unit and 14 branches in Norway under our Neumann business unit. Our customers primarily purchase our products for use in the resilient RMI market which has shown stable growth during 14 out of the past 17 years across the Nordic region.

517,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.1,General Economic Conditions and Activity in the Construction Industry,"The construction materials distribution industry and demand for our products in our markets is dependent on the level of activity in the construction and renovation sector in these markets. Total construction and renovation activity includes RMI as well as new build activity. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, management estimates RMI activity accounted for approximately 60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business, and new build activity accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business. The level of construction and renovation activity in the Nordics is cyclical in nature and is dependent on the level of construction- and renovationrelated expenditures in the residential, industrial and commercial sectors, public investments and public and private spending on infrastructure projects. Such construction- and renovation-related expenditures are particularly sensitive to factors such as GDP growth, interest rates, cost and availability of mortgage financing for residential, commercial and industrial construction and renovation, inflation, consumer and producer confidence as well as other macroeconomic factors. Political instability, changes in government policy, increased immigration and urbanization may also affect the construction and renovation industry. As a result, cyclical fluctuations in the construction and renovation industry has historically affected our sales and gross margin. Historically, RMI activities across the Nordics have exhibited structural resilience through the economic cycle and has shown stable growth during 14 out of the past 17 years, which has in the 70 ----- past contributed to stable revenue generation and gross margins. RMI activity is more resilient to cyclical fluctuations than new build activity and primarily driven by the need to modernize existing housing stock. In the past, RMI activity has generated a larger proportion of our revenue during economic downturns due to delays or temporary interruptions in the new build industry.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.2,Trends in the Construction and Renovation Industry,"Our results of operations are affected by general trends in the construction and renovation industry, including an increase in the number of private consumers hiring SMEs for RMI activity, the growing trend towards urbanization, an ageing population, increased own brand penetration and other key trends. We estimate that SMEs accounted for approximately 50% of the gross profit pool in the construction materials distribution industry across the Nordics in 2016, which is forecast to grow at a faster rate than the overall construction materials distribution market between 2016 and 2021 according to a leading management consulting firm. We consider SMEs to be our core customer group, accounting for approximately 56% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business in the year ended July 31, 2017. Consequently, our business is benefitting from a continuing increase in the number of private consumers hiring SMEs for RMI activity rather than completing RMI works themselves, which has led to stable sales to SMEs during the last three years. This trend has historically been supported by government tax incentives on home improvements in Denmark and Sweden, including, for example, the ROT tax subsidy in Sweden, which allows for a tax deduction of up to 30% of the labor costs incurred in relation to RMI works carried out on one’s property, which incentivizes private consumers to hire SMEs for RMI activity. In addition, we believe our business is well-positioned to benefit from growing urbanization trends, particularly given our footprint is strategically skewed toward attractive growth areas. A leading management consulting firm expects the growth of urbanization to lead larger geographic regions and cities to outgrow the rest of the market and increase demand for both residential and non-residential RMI and new build activities in such regions. Changing demographics also affect our results of operations, as an aging population tends to lead to a shift away from DIY toward the hiring of SMEs and other of our B2B customers for new build and RMI needs. Management believes since wealth may increase with age, an older population may also be more able and willing to spend on new build and RMI activities than a younger population. In addition, our results of operations are affected by increasing own brand penetration across the Nordics as own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on average than branded SKUs, according to management estimates. We currently offer our customers approximately 4,110 own brand SKUs. Based on independent market studies, we estimate that own brand products currently hold approximately 10% of the relevant market share in the Nordics, and we expect such market share to double by 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.3,Our Ability to Effectively Compete with Other Building Material Distributors,"Competitive pressure from other building material distributors affects our ability to attract customers in the markets in which we operate, and may result in reduced sales volumes and pricing pressure and require us to make additional capital expenditures to upgrade branches or incur additional costs, for example relating to staff numbers or our logistics and distribution network, as we seek to provide more competitive products and services. Given our scale, we believe that we benefit from significant operational advantages compared to our competitors, which are mostly “mom and pop” shops collaborating in buying groups or franchisee-owned operations, which generally cannot match the combination of our harmonized sourcing capabilities across the Nordics, collaborative customer service network and convenient national and cross-regional product availability. Additionally, operating a company-owned network of branches allows us the opportunity to leverage our scale to provide flexible collection and delivery services on a national and cross-regional basis, thus reducing infrastructure and fleet costs, as well as operate at better sourcing and working capital levels than our competitors by harmonizing our product assortment across branches. Furthermore, in order to enhance customer loyalty, we have implemented a customer discount and loyalty bonus system across certain of our business units pursuant to which we offer favorable pricing terms and purchasing conditions to, for example, repeat customers whose total purchase spend with us is high, which may affect our revenue and gross margin. We also provide credit to a majority of our customers, which for many is an essential criteria for purchases. We mitigate the potential risks for providing credit to our customers through credit insurance and our credit control team.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.4,"Product Pricing, Product Mix and Supply Costs","The price of our products has a direct impact on our revenue and is dependent on, among other things, general economic conditions and pricing pressure from our competitors in the markets in which we operate. If pricing competition increases, we may sell fewer products than expected or we may sell these at lower prices, which could affect our revenue and gross margin. We have introduced our smart pricing strategy pursuant to which we have implemented consistent shelf prices. In addition, to facilitate movement in inventory, we have established pricing structures under which we offer discounts on certain trade-specific “high runner” products, competitive prices for items purchased frequently and fairer prices for items purchased infrequently. We believe our smart pricing strategy enhances brand and value perception among our customers to further drive sales growth. 71 ----- Our results of operations are also affected by the type of products that we sell and the type of construction activity for which these products are used by our customers. For example, products such as timber, concrete and insulation materials, which customers may use for new build activity, can generate lower margins than products such as paints, tiles, sealants, sand paper and adhesives, which customers may use for RMI activity. Furthermore, as of October 31, 2017, we offered our customers 4,110 own brand SKUs and are currently in the process of building a strategic common core range of 800 SKUs for our own brand portfolio. Own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on average than branded SKUs, according to management estimates. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we derived approximately 91% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from branded products and approximately 9% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from own brand products. Compared to the three months ended October 31, 2016, our own brand products generated approximately 31% more revenue for the Ongoing Business in the three months ended October 31, 2017, according to management estimates. As a result, increased sales of own brand products may positively affect our gross margin. Moreover, our results of operations are affected by our ability to source our products at competitive prices. Leveraging our scale, our business benefits from our harmonized sourcing capabilities across the Nordics which allow us to reduce costs and increase our gross margin by maximizing purchasing power through rationalizing our supplier base and creating performance-based supplier contracts. Furthermore, our results of operations are affected by our customers’ preferences for our sales channels. Our stock collected channel typically generates higher gross margins due to a higher margin product mix and value-added potential from large product assortment and availability within branches, as well as higher exposure to higher margin RMI activities. Our direct delivery channel typically generates lower gross margins, as large order volumes can lead to discounts and lower purchasing power with manufacturers and as this channel typically has higher exposure to lower margin new build activities. Our stock delivered channel typically generates variable gross margins depending on the country of operation and type of customer contract, including as a result of mixed exposure to RMI and new build activities. As a result, an increase in sales through our stock collected channel may positively affect our gross margin.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.5,Flexibility of Our Cost Structure,"Our cost structure has historically provided us with significant downside protection during periods of adverse economic conditions. Given the intrinsic nature of a distributor business, approximately 90% of our cost base is either directly linked to sales (such as cost of sales and fleet costs), or is considered by management to have a high potential for short-term right-sizing (such as employee benefits expenses related to employees with flexible contracts and fleet costs). Our fixed costs mainly relate to the fixed portion of our employee benefits expenses, including our base employee and pension costs, administrative expenses and other fixed costs, such as costs related to IT functions. Additionally, we have historically been able to further adjust our cost structure during economic downturns by rationalizing discretionary costs related to advertisement, infrastructure, administration and IT. Furthermore, the downside protection offered through our variable cost structure is partially due to our large freehold portfolio of 195 properties independently valued at up to €805 million as of September 30, 2017. Given the large portion of owned branches, our business benefits from low impact from rent expenses on our cash flow when compared to our competitors across Europe as we do not have a fixed monthly cash outflow with respect to such rent expenses. In the year ended July 31, 2017, management estimates that external rent accounted for only 14% of our EBITDA for the Ongoing Business. By contrast, external rent represented approximately 20% and 37% of EBITDA for Ahlsell and Byggmax, respectively, during each of their 2016 financial years. Additionally, the rigorous management of our working capital and our flexible capital expenditure levels, have historically allowed us to generate significant cash flows, resulting in a cash conversion rate, defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business less adjusted capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business, of 72%, 70% and 61% for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Our revenue and costs, including sourcing costs, for each business unit are primarily in the respective local currency, which offers natural hedging opportunities. We also have limited exposure to foreign exchange risks in connection with the U.S. dollar as we source some of our own brand products from China in U.S. dollars. In addition, we sometimes source certain of our products for our Beijer branches from Denmark, exposing us to limited foreign exchange risks between the Danish krone and Swedish krona, while at the same time reducing our exposure to Swedish krona and increasing our exposure to Danish krone, which is pegged to the euro.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Maintenance capital expenditures typically relate to branch refurbishment in connection with improving our customer offer and space allocations and IT expenditures. As of September 30, 2017, we had a freehold property portfolio comprising 195 properties, including 153 properties at which we operate branches, eleven properties in Denmark shared with Silvan and other properties. Our freehold property portfolio allows us discretion in our capital expenditures, as we can decide on the amount and timing of our maintenance capital expenditures. The scope and related investment associated with branch refurbishments varies by the size and category of the physical branch as well as its general condition, and we generally target a payback on investment within three to four years. Expansion capital expenditures have historically comprised one-off expenditures related to the development of new branches, the acquisition of the freehold of existing branches and our distribution center. In connection with the completion of the Acquisition, we expect to incur expenses related to replicating certain functions, such as stand-alone insurance, IT, finance and treasury functions, that we have previously shared with Ferguson on a Group-wide basis. In addition, in connection with our strategy to optimize the footprint of our branches in above market growth areas, we may in the future selectively acquire freehold properties in strategic locations across the Nordics. Costs incurred in improving and/or expanding our property portfolio are generally capitalized and then depreciated in line with IFRS. As we continue to invest in the improvement and optimization of our branch network, including through the consolidation of our branches and any selective bolt-on acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, capital expenditures and costs associated with the depreciation of the corresponding capitalized costs will likely increase.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Our revenue and net working capital generally reflect seasonality in the building sector, and our most important trading periods in terms of revenue, operating results and cash flow has historically been in our first and fourth financial quarters as a result of increased new build and RMI activity during warmer periods with longer daylight hours, among other things. In the winter months, we typically generate less revenue due to low construction and renovation activity as a result of cold weather, partially offset by an increase in indoor activities such as painting. Additionally, our results of operations are affected by generally consistent seasonal swings in our net working capital. Typically, we experience a cash outflow in the winter months as we tend to incur additional expenses in advance of our peak sales periods that occur during our first and fourth financial quarters. We typically experience a cash inflow in the summer and fall as we finalize collecting payments from customers who have made purchases for their spring construction and renovation projects simultaneously as we begin collecting payments from customers who are making purchases for their summer and early fall construction and renovation projects. We finance our working capital needs through cash and cash equivalents and third-party borrowings. Following the completion of the Transactions, we will utilize cash on hand and our Revolving Credit Facility to cover swings in our working capital. See also “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Net Working Capital.” Our results are also affected by periods of abnormal, severe or unseasonable weather conditions, particularly if such events occur during our peak sales period.

In connection with our “Felix” strategy, our business experienced, among other things, an increase in headquarters and other central costs without capturing related scale benefits and a drop in gross margins as a result of our former management’s focus on high volume products with lower margins. Additionally, during the implementation of our “Felix” strategy, our business lacked strategic focus seeking to tailor our product and service offering to both private customers and B2B customers which led to a loss of scale benefits in our product offerings to our core SME customers. Furthermore, due to inconsistent category management across the Group, our customers experienced inconsistent products assortment, availability and product pricing. Due to inconsistent leadership and management difficulties across our business units we also lost key personnel during the implementation of our “Felix” strategy. Ultimately, our “Felix” strategy did not have a positive impact on our financial position during its implementation. 73 ----- _Back to Basics_ In the year ended July 31, 2017, after our CEO, Søren P. Olesen, stepped into the role of Group-wide CEO from his previous position with STARK DK, we initiated our “Back to Basics” strategy with the intention to drive our top-line growth by refocusing our operations on our SME core customer group and enhance our profitability by streamlining our headquarters and central administration functions, rationalizing our footprint, simplifying our distribution network and driving better sourcing initiatives through leveraging our scale and harmonizing our product assortment across the Nordics. We estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate cost savings of approximately €7 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, mainly as a result of better contractual terms following our renegotiation of key supply contracts and as a result of headcount reductions and a more streamlined headquarters if these cost saving measures had been implemented on November 1, 2016. Overall, we have identified approximately €74 million in operational, sourcing- and network-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which we aim to realize by 2021. Additionally, we have initiated several topline growth initiatives, primarily related to product assortment, availability and pricing, which management believes, together with improvements in the market, have resulted in an increase in revenue for the Ongoing Business of approximately 5% during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017. Better Sourcing To reach our objective of developing better sourcing processes, we are implementing a systematic review of our supply chain operations by focusing on three key components: (i) our own brand products, (ii) our direct sourcing costs and (iii) our indirect sourcing costs. By increasing our focus on own brand products, we intend to continue supporting our margins by developing our own brand product portfolio to have reduced overlap with our branded products portfolio and building a strategic common core range of 800 own brand SKUs shared across our business units. We expect that increased sourcing for our own brand products will provide us with greater leverage in negotiations with our suppliers than we may have with suppliers of branded products since suppliers of branded products also receive offers from our competitors. In addition, we are in the process of decreasing our direct sourcing costs by developing our pan-Nordic sourcing setup and consolidating volumes to achieve economies of scale by centralizing sourcing functions through STARK Group Sourcing, our Group sourcing unit, and decreasing procurement costs. We have recently implemented a new organizational model with a new sourcing management team and board and we intend to further leverage our harmonized sourcing platform across the Nordics to consolidate our supplier base and maximize purchasing power. Moreover, we are in the process of reviewing and negotiating our sourcing contracts across our business to align purchasing terms and procurement prices across our four business units. Furthermore, we intend to maintain and, in certain cases, strengthen our general policy of direct sourcing, which allows us to directly negotiate prices with suppliers. In parallel, we are in the process of decreasing our indirect sourcing costs by continuing to streamline our supplier base, creating performance-based supplier contracts and improving the management of demand for our products and supplies. We estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate sourcing- and procurement-related cost savings of approximately €3 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, mainly as a result of better contractual terms following our renegotiation of key supply contracts, a leaner cost base for our supply chain and enhanced optimization opportunities for our network if these cost saving measures had been implemented on November 1, 2016. Overall, we have identified approximately €51 million of sourcing and procurement-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, primarily including direct sourcing initiatives and increased own brand sourcing, which we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021. Stronger Network In connection with building a stronger network to better serve our customers, we are optimizing our branch footprint and logistics platform and providing greater access to increased availability of stock. For example, we exited our Silvan DIY business in 2017 to increase focus on our SME segment, and developed and launched a new SME marketing campaign to leverage our fastest growing profit pool. Additionally, to optimize our physical footprint, in 2017, we closed 30 underperforming branches in low growth areas to focus our business on regions that are expected to outperform national averages. We will continue optimizing the footprint of our branches to capture the benefit of expected growth in the markets in coming years and increase our competitive advantages. While we believe our business benefits from our current geographic coverage, we may in the future pursue strategic relocations and consolidations of certain branches to better locations along highly travelled roads benefiting from higher footfall or visibility and will assess any new branches that we bring into our network on a case-by-case basis. We continue to monitor our existing branch base to selectively close or merge branches that are performing poorly or otherwise do not meet our expectations. 74 ----- Additionally, we aim to further simplify our distribution network while optimizing our delivery routes and pricing terms by, among other things, establishing additional ship hubs, developing our recently established light-side hub in Denmark to streamline the distribution of slow moving items, downsizing and outsourcing certain of our centralized warehouse processes to achieve cost savings and consolidating the number of dedicated branches used for the distribution of products to better allocate our resources. Overall, we have identified approximately €13 million of network-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, primarily related to a simplified distribution network and an optimized footprint of branches, which we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021. Efficient Operator We intend to continue focusing on cost management through reduced overhead costs and the optimization of operations at the business unit and branch level. We have recently implemented a number of initiatives to reorganize our managerial structure and optimize the size of our headquarters, with the aim of strengthening local decision-making and accountability and regaining focus on day-to-day operations at the business unit and branch level. At the same time, we intend to maintain efficiency through centralized functions from our headquarters, including for strategy, performance, human resources and compliance across our business. For example, in 2016, we initiated significant downsizing at our headquarters, including the relocation of 178 FTEs from our central headquarters to the business unit level to clarify responsibilities, heighten responsiveness to support requirements and increase accountability. We also initiated a total planned reduction of 55 FTEs, excluding the hiring of 19 FTEs, expected to be completed by the end of June 2018. We estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate operational cost savings of approximately €4 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, mainly as a result of headcount reductions and a more streamlined headquarters if these cost saving measures had been implemented on November 1, 2016. Overall, we have identified approximately €11 million of operational cost savings for the Ongoing Business, primarily related to a leaner headquarters, a streamlined workforce and increased focus on business unit-level activity and cost management, which we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021. Top Line Growth Initiatives To improve our revenue generation and sales volume, we have refocused our business on our core customer group, SMEs, which represent the fastest growing profit pool in the Nordic construction materials distribution market. In line with strategically refocusing our business, we are intend to offer SMEs an industry-leading product assortment and availability which is tailored to our customers’ trade-specific needs. Additionally, we have recently begun implementing a smart pricing strategy across our business which is aimed at rationalizing shelf prices. In line with our smart pricing strategy, we have established pricing structures under which we offer discounts on certain trade-specific “high runner” products, competitive prices for items purchased frequently and fairer prices for items purchased infrequently. Furthermore, we intend to capture digital growth opportunities by leveraging our existing physical network of branches and logistics facilities, as well as industry experience and product expertise and improving our online platform for SMEs to quickly, efficiently and comprehensively serve and advise our customers on the best products for each of their projects’ needs.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

The fiscal year of the Issuer ends on July 31 of each calendar year and the first annual consolidated financial statements for the Issuer will be available in respect of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2018. The Issuer will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the comparability of the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements with the Financial Statements contained in this offering memorandum. We will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Transactions to our financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Completion Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made. Furthermore, we will incur a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the Transactions.

The sale of Silvan concluded on August 31, 2017. Additionally, we divested our Cheapy chain, a Swedish discount chain, which was sold in April 2014, and Oscar Perschard, a small Norwegian branch, which was sold in July 2014. We include the results of operation, financial position and cash flows from Silvan, Cheapy and Oscar Perschard in our Financial Statements as discontinued operations, which are shown separately from continuing operations in our Financial Statements. In this offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, references to any financial data are only to financial data from continuing operations and exclude the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Silvan, Cheapy and Oscar Perschard. Additionally, in line with our strategy to focus our business on areas with above market growth, we closed 30 underperforming branches in low growth areas, including 14 STARK DK branches in January 2017, eight STARK FI branches in January 2017, seven Beijer branches in April 2017 and the Norwegian Sandvold business in March 2017. As these branch closures occurred during our financial year ended July 31, 2017, our Audited Financial Statements include the contribution to our financial results by these 30 branches until their respective dates of closure. Additionally, the comparative unaudited financial data for the three months ended October 31, 2016 included in the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements includes the contribution to our financial results by these 30 branches for the entire three month reporting period. In the future, these 30 branches will not contribute to the consolidated financial results of the Issuer as a result of which the future consolidated financial statements of the Issuer will not be comparable to our Audited Financial Statements and the comparative unaudited financial data for the three months ended October 31, 2016 included in the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. At the same time, our future revenue will be affected by our ability to retain sales from these closed branches, which would create an initial increase in year-on-year revenue during the first twelve months following the branch closures as sales would be concentrated to fewer branches. We expect this increase in revenue to weaken in subsequent periods once the retained revenue has been fully reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, following the completion of the Acquisition, the Issuer will report its consolidated financial results excluding certain operational properties in Denmark and Norway, a distribution center in Finland, the headquarters in Copenhagen and 30 vacant properties, which have historically been included in the Target’s financial results but do not form part of the Target’s business that will be acquired by Lone Star Fund X in connection with the Acquisition. As a result, the future consolidated financial statements of the Issuer will not be comparable to our Financial Statements. We also include in this offering memorandum certain Unaudited Adjusted Financial Information for the Ongoing Business for revenue, cost of sales, gross profit, operating costs, trading profit and Adjusted EBITDA.

This increase was primarily driven by increased sales from the recently opened Oslo branch. _Gross Profit for the Ongoing Business_ Gross profit for the Ongoing Business increased by €9 million, or 6.3%, to €152 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €143 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016.

This decrease was primarily driven by mix effects as a result of a higher share of large customers that tend to generate lower margins. STARK FI Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit increased by €2 million, or 8.0%, to €27 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €25 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by strong construction activity, partially offset by lower gross margin percentage driven by sales channel mix. Beijer Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit increased by €4 million, or 9.5%, to €46 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €42 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales, which positively impacted bonuses we received from suppliers, as well as a reduction in the value of rebates we offered. Neumann Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Neumann business unit increased by €3 million, or 33.3%, to €12 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €9 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the implementation of our smart pricing initiative, which allowed us to manually increase pricing for certain products, as well as increased sales to large customers. _Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by €8 million, or 25.0%, to €40 million for the three months ended October 31, 2017 from €32 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016.

This increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue in our STARK DK, STARK FI and Neumann business units, partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue in our Beijer business unit due to one-off impacts that increased revenues in the prior year while the first half of the year ended July 31, 2017 saw negative revenue growth, revenue growth picked up significantly in the second half of the year ended July 31, 2017 due to strong construction activity, the implementation of various initiatives and other factors.

This increase was primarily driven by increased sales to SMEs following the implementation of our “Back to Basics” strategy to increase our top-line growth. During the period under review, we supported our strategic focus on SME customers through initiatives including improved availability of core products, focused product assortment and sales training. The growth in revenue for our STARK DK business unit was partially offset by a decline in private customers as a result of a general shift away from DIY activity in Denmark. STARK FI Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit increased by €34 million, or 6.6%, to €553 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €519 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by growth in the Finnish construction market as well as management’s strategic focus on SMEs supported by a better product assortment and product display. In addition, revenue increased due to the successful execution of “Project Hunt,” which involved STARK FI contacting local builders whose volumes have recently declined. 80 ----- Beijer Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit decreased by €11 million, or 2.0%, to €554 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €565 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a loss of sales associates that had left Beijer in previous years, which was partially offset by the addition of 28 experienced sales staff as part of our top-line growth initiatives during the third and fourth quarters of the year ended July 31, 2017, which led to increased sales growth in the fourth quarter of the year ended July 31, 2017. Additionally, the decrease in revenue was also driven by a reduction in the ROT tax subsidy from 50% to 30%, which positively affected the prior year period as customers brought forward certain RMI projects to the prior period to take advantage of the higher tax deduction. Neumann Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our Neumann business unit increased by €6 million, or 4.1%, to €152 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €146 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by overall market growth in Norway and strong performance of our Tromsø, Bergen and Mjåvann branches, as well as large customer projects commencing in the year. _Gross Profit for the Ongoing Business_ Gross profit for the Ongoing Business increased by €3 million, or 0.6%, to €532 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €529 million for the year ended July 31, 2016.

This increase was primarily driven by better pricing as a result of the implementation of our smart pricing strategy, which increased underlying margins and profit. STARK FI Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit increased by €6 million, or 6.7%, to €96 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €90 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a number of corrective actions relating to the reversal and replacement of one of our price reduction initiatives as well as the implementation of a formal weekly price review to monitor manual pricing levels at the branch level. Such actions led to a 0.4% increase in gross margin for our STARK FI business unit for the fourth quarter in the year ended July 31, 2017 compared to the first quarter in the year ended July 31, 2017. 81 ----- Beijer Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit decreased by €6 million, or 3.6%, to €159 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €165 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a shift in mix of sales to local and regional builders from sales through our stock collected and stock delivered channels to sales through our direct delivery channel, combined with pricing pressure from competitors. In response, we have implemented a number of strategic initiatives which target margin growth, including reviewing all product pricing for our Beijer business unit, optimizing our supply chain and ensuring that delivery charges are passed on to customers more consistently. Neumann Gross profit for the Ongoing Business from our Neumann business unit increased by €1 million, or 2.6%, to €40 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €39 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter of the year ended July 31, 2017 compared to the fourth quarter in the year ended July 31, 2016, which was primarily due to the implementation of a new pricing strategy to increase price points, increased focus on monitoring margins and an increased commitment to pass through price increases from suppliers to customers more consistently. This increase was partially offset by a slowdown in the oil industry, which resulted in pricing pressure in our branches located along the southwest coast of Norway. _Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business_ Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business decreased by €1 million, or 1.1%, to €93 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 from €94 million for the year ended July 31, 2016.

This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes as a result of increased activity in the professional construction and renovation industry in Denmark, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from private consumers. STARK FI Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our STARK FI business unit decreased by €14 million, or 2.6%, to €519 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €533 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from private consumers as well as a decrease in revenue from retailer customers following the weaker trading performance of certain smaller retailer customers. Beijer Revenue for the Ongoing Business from our Beijer business unit increased by €18 million, or 3.3%, to €565 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €547 million for the year ended July 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in the ROT tax subsidy from 50% to 30%, which increased construction and renovation activity during the first half of our financial year ended July 31, 2016 as customers and consumers brought forward certain RMI projects before the tax reduction took effect from January 1, 2016.

This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in demand from customers in the oil industry during the year ended July 31, 2016, which primarily affected Neumann’s two largest branches, Byrne and Stavanger. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by increased revenue at our Kristiansand branch driven by growth in the local market as well as increased project activity with a number of large customers. _Gross Profit for the Ongoing Business_ Gross profit for the Ongoing Business decreased by €5 million, or 0.9%, to €529 million for the year ended July 31, 2016 from €534 million for the year ended July 31, 2015.

Our primary cash needs relate to capital and other expenditures for funding our working capital requirements, maintaining and refurbishing existing branches and meeting debt service requirements. Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in “—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors.” Following the completion of the Transactions, we will also have access to €100.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working capital and general corporate needs. The availability of this facility is dependent upon certain conditions described further under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” We believe that, based on our current cash flows, these sources of liquidity, together with available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditure and debt service for at least the next twelve months. We cannot, however, assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, that the currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available under the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.

Historically, our inventory levels have increased ahead of our peak sales periods during our first and fourth financial quarters. See “—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Seasonality, Weather and Trade Periods.” Typically, we experience a cash outflow in the winter months as we tend to incur additional expenses in advance of our peak sales periods that occur during our first and fourth financial quarters. We typically experience a cash inflow in the summer and fall as we finalize collecting payments from customers who have made purchases for their spring construction and renovation projects simultaneously as we begin collecting payments from customers who are making purchases for their summer and early fall construction and renovation projects. Despite the seasonal variations in net working capital, our net working capital is, on average, positive. During the year ended July 31, 2017, our working capital for the Historical Business normalized from its high point of approximately €80 million in February to its average level of approximately €20 million until May. Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to utilize cash on hand and borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility to manage seasonal variations in our net working capital.

Our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the three months ended October 31, 2017, amounted to an outflow of €33 million, primarily driven by an outflow of cash due to the cash tied up in increasing working capital, specifically an increase in trade and other receivables, partially offset by positive operating profit. Our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the three months ended October 31, 2016, amounted to an outflow of €24 million, primarily driven by a positive operating profit, offset by unfavorable movements in working capital. Our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, amounted to an inflow of €52 million, primarily driven by a reduction in net working capital, driven by a decrease in inventories and trade and other receivables and a decrease in provisions and other liabilities. Our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended July 31, 2016, amounted to an inflow of €70 million, primarily driven by a positive operating profit, partially offset by increased inventory levels in STARK DK due to a change in wood supplier and to increased product availability in STARK FI. Our cash flow from operating activities for the Historical Business for the year ended July 31, 2015, amounted to an inflow of €107 million, primarily driven by a positive operating profit, a reduction in net working capital supported by longer payment terms with suppliers in Finland instead of cash discounts and a focus across all business units on inventory reduction. _Cash Flows from Investing Activities from Continuing Operations for the Historical Business_ Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business principally relates to capital expenditures, including in relation to the purchases of land, property, plant and equipment, the refurbishment and maintenance of our existing branches, range review related changes and the investment in our distribution center and IT as well as intangible assets. Cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the three months ended October 31, 2017, decreased by €11 million from a cash outflow of €11 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016, to a cash outflow of €22 million, primarily driven by costs related to the new distribution center for STARK DK and the new STARK Group head office as well as investments in certain of our Beijer branches. Cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, increased by €19 million from a cash outflow of €34 million for the year ended July 31, 2016, to a cash outflow of €53 million for the year ended July 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of the freehold of an existing branch for €5 million and land for a new distribution center in Denmark for €11 million, in addition to an IT project costing €3 million, during the year ended July 31, 2017. Cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended July 31, 2016, decreased by €8 million from a cash outflow of €42 million for the year ended July 31, 2015, to a cash outflow of €34 million for the year ended July 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a planned reduction in investment in branch maintenance, offset by the acquisition of the freehold of an existing branch in Finland for €8 million in the year ended July 31, 2015. _Cash Flows from Financing Activities from Continuing Operations for the Historical Business_ Cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the three months ended October 31, 2017, decreased by €62 million from a cash outflow of €14 million for the three months ended October 31, 2016, to a cash outflow of €76 million, primarily driven by the repayment of our secured long-term bank loans in full on September 30, 2017. 85 ----- Cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, decreased by €91 million from a cash inflow of €36 million for the year ended July 31, 2016, to a cash outflow of €55 million for the year ended July 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by the partial repayment of our secured long-term bank loans. Cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations for the Historical Business for the year ended July 31, 2016, increased by €107 million from a cash outflow of €71 million for the year ended July 31, 2015, to a cash inflow of €36 million for the year ended July 31, 2016.

517,Offerings 2018.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Market Overview,18.1.1,Nordic Construction and Renovation Market,"The building materials supplied by STARK Group serve the Nordic construction and renovation market. The construction and renovation market may be divided into two sub-sectors with different market dynamics: (i) new construction (“new build”), involving the construction of new residential and non-residential buildings, and (ii) renovation, maintenance and improvement (“RMI”), involving construction work performed on existing residential and non-residential buildings. Within the construction and renovation market, the residential and non-residential sectors are the key driving elements. According to a leading management consulting firm, the total Nordic residential and non-residential construction and renovation market was estimated at €105 billion in 2016, with the majority, or €58 billion, comprising the resilient RMI market and the remainder, or €47 billion, comprising the new build market. _RMI Market_ The RMI market is resilient and significantly less affected by market fluctuations than the new build market. The Nordic RMI market exhibited historically stable and resilient growth even through the economic downturn after the 2008 financial crisis, experiencing positive year-on-year growth in 14 out of the last 17 years according to Euroconstruct. STARK Group has significant exposure to this resilient market, with RMI activity accounting for approximately 60% of revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, according to management estimates. Such exposure to the RMI market leads to a degree of counter-cyclicality of gross profit in downturn periods. New build sales tend to be characterized by larger orders for construction projects that can involve products, as well as a sales channel, that generate lower margins. In contrast, RMI sales, which are made predominantly to SME customers that comprise STARK Group’s core customer group, tend to be characterized by more frequent and smaller purchases of high margin products, typically through a sales channel that generates higher margins. In a period of potential downturn, the resilience of the RMI market counteracts the cyclicality of the new build market, and while new build sales may decrease, gross margins may benefit from a higher share of revenue coming from higher-margin RMI sales. Growth in the RMI market is impacted by a number of macroeconomic, regulatory, and sector-specific factors, such as interest rates, government subsidies or housing transaction volumes. According to Euroconstruct, the Nordic RMI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2016 and 2019. In particular, the Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian RMI markets are forecasted to grow at CAGRs of approximately 2.1%, 0.9%, 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, over the same period. Residential RMI The Nordic residential RMI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2016 and 2019, driven by an increasing willingness and ability to pay for repairs and modernizations, in line with historical growth rates and favored by the general upturn in the economy. 90 ----- The Danish residential RMI market is forecasted to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 2.2% between 2016 and 2019, according to Euroconstruct. The Danish residential RMI market is expected to benefit from higher housing needs due to increasing immigration and a growing trend towards urbanization, and will be further supported by a tax relief scheme introduced in 2016 that will apply to projects related to energy conservation and the installation of broadband internet. The Swedish residential RMI market is expected grow at a CAGR of approximately 0.2% over the period from 2016 to 2019, according to Euroconstruct. Residential RMI experienced stable growth in Sweden between 2014 and 2016 on the back of strong consumer-driven market growth, sustained private consumption, growing house prices and low interest rates. In addition, simpler rules for the extension of family houses, such as adaptations of roofs to extend attics, positively impacted the Swedish residential RMI market. Beginning in 2015, the downward adjustment of tax deductions on labor costs became the key reason behind only moderate growth forecasts over the next two years, although such effect is expected to be counterbalanced by (i) increasing immigration rates, leading to transformations and renovations of existing buildings, and (ii) a government support program applying to multi-family properties built between 1961 and 1975 under which investment support is provided if such building becomes at least 20% more energyefficient after the renovation. Additionally, residential RMI growth in Sweden is expected to reflect the positive impact of renovation works carried out by property owners in an effort to improve building quality and raise rents. The Finnish residential RMI market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2016 and 2019. Changes in overall economic conditions in Finland have caused fluctuations in new housing construction volumes, while RMI has increased steadily over the past 20 years. The outlook of residential RMI in Finland remains positive as renovation needs are generally growing, with blocks of flats and attached houses reaching the age when renovation is typically required. The Norwegian residential RMI market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 2.6% over the period from 2016 to 2019, primarily driven by strong growth in private consumption, with a substantial increase in the willingness of households to spend money on RMI works, and by an increasing number of housing transformations, particularly from office buildings into dwellings. In addition, the Norwegian residential RMI market will further benefit from an expected increase in real wages and reduction in the level of unemployment. Across all four countries, housing transaction volumes represent a key driver of RMI activity. When properties change hands, RMI work is likely to be performed either before the sale by the seller to increase valuation or after the sale by the buyer to renovate and personalize the newly purchased property. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2017, the total estimated number of sales of residential housing in Denmark reached 57,931 units, slightly above the long-term average from 2000 to 2016, according to Statistics Denmark. In Sweden, transaction volumes with respect to granted registrations of real estate titles are in line with the longer term average between 2000 and 2016, according to SCB.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Non-Residential RMI Euroconstruct estimates that the Nordic non-residential RMI market will grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2016 and 2019, in line with historical growth rates and driven mainly by renovations and modernizations in public service-type institutions, such as schools or hospitals. 91 ----- The Danish non-residential RMI market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.0% between 2016 and 2019, according to Euroconstruct. RMI needs in public buildings remain high in Denmark. Schools modernization projects in Denmark are expected to add to overall RMI activity from 2017 onwards. With respect to Danish hospitals, a number of old units are gradually being replaced by new ones, and the medium-term effect on RMI activity will depend upon the new usage, if any, of the former hospital buildings. The Swedish non-residential RMI market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 1.7% over the period from 2016 to 2019, according to Euroconstruct, primarily driven by a favorable real estate age structure, which leads to an increased number of buildings in need of repairs or modernizations each year. Furthermore, as long as rents and vacancies are stable, professional property owners tend to stick to their renovation plans in order to preserve property value. The government’s goal to reduce energy consumption in the building stock is also expected to boost non-residential RMI activity. The Finnish non-residential RMI market is forecasted by Euroconstruct to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.6% between 2016 and 2019, on the back of considerable expected growth in renovations and modernizations of public buildings, namely schools and hospitals, as well as in maintenance works on commercial and industrial premises. In general, due to the age structure, the need to renovate non-residential spaces is expected to increase steadily in the medium- to long-term. The non-residential RMI market in Norway is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.8%, according to Euroconstruct. Key growth drivers include expected growth in building renovations by private companies, on the back of improved overall economic conditions in Norway, and the extraordinary government grants to municipalities and counties for RMI works on public buildings offered in 2016 to be utilized in the coming years. _New Build Market_ For STARK Group, new build activity accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of the gross profit for the Ongoing Business in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, according to management estimates. New build activity is primarily dependent on factors such as population growth, immigration rates and urbanization as well as vacancy levels and lease rates within the non-residential new build market. Growth in new construction reflects general developments in the overall economy, and is impacted by macroeconomic and regulatory changes such as interest rate movements and government construction targets. According to Euroconstruct, the Nordic new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 4.1% over the period from 2016 to 2019. In particular, the Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian new build markets are forecasted to grow at CAGRs of approximately 6.3%, 7.1%, 0.7% and 2.6%, respectively, over the same period. Residential New Build The Nordic residential new build market is forecasted to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 4.2% between 2016 and 2019, according to Euroconstruct, driven by favorable economic conditions across the Nordics, increasing immigration and a growing trend towards urbanization. The Danish residential new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9.6% between 2016 and 2019, driven by immigration as well as internal migration towards larger cities where housing is getting scarcer and more expensive. In particular, people are expected to move to areas within reasonable distance from Copenhagen, where the number of unoccupied dwellings is limited and new construction is needed. Furthermore, according to Euroconstruct, the Danish residential new build market is still considerably below the peak level reached in 2008, which further justifies strong growth expectations. In addition, with the revision of the residential real estate taxation system in May 2017, there will be a new system for evaluating the taxable value of each piece of real estate that is expected to result in overall lower property taxes. The Swedish residential new build market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 5.9% over the period from 2016 to 2019, according to Euroconstruct. Sweden is facing substantial immigration, which will increase dwellings on temporary building permits. According to Euroconstruct, there is still a scarcity of housing in more than 80% of all Swedish municipalities and approximately 90% of the Swedish population lives in cities characterized by a housing shortage, especially with respect to affordable rental apartments. For this reason, the Swedish government has set a construction target of 600,000 new dwellings by 2025, compared to the previous target of 250,000 by 2020. The recent lag in housing supply and population growth is expected to drive long-term new residential demand in Sweden, as shown in the chart below. 92 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

For instance, when GDP growth is high, people have greater confidence in the economy and hence they may build or renovate houses and purchase more building products. According to a leading management consulting firm, GDP is expected to grow across the Nordics in the coming years at a CAGR of 0.8% in Finland and 2.6% in Sweden, each from the period from 2016 to 2019, with the largest increase expected in Sweden due to expansionary monetary policy. Norway’s GDP is expected to rebound due to a monetary and fiscal stimulus, while slower growth is expected in Finland due to lower domestic demand. Private consumption also affects the building material distribution market. According to a leading management consulting firm, the share of personal income allocated to buying construction materials is relatively stable, implying a high correlation between general consumption and the construction and renovation retail market. Private consumption is forecasted to grow at CAGRs of 1.5%, 2.4%, 1.9% and 1.9% in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, respectively, between 2016 and 2019. Consumer confidence is closely related to private consumption. Greater consumer confidence implies increased spending and less saving, which has a positive effect on the construction materials distribution market. OECD, a leading management consulting firm and industry experts expect that the increase in consumer confidence experienced across the Nordics in recent years will continue until 2018 across all four countries in which we operate. Movements in lending interest rates have a marginal impact on STARK Group’s market. While a decrease in rates is beneficial, higher rates reduce household income and consumption, thus leading to increased savings and higher mortgage costs, which can have an unfavorable effect on construction and renovation activity. Sweden’s Riksbank has recently kept the repo rate negative, while rates are expected to be low both in the Euro area, as reaffirmed by the ECB in March 2017, and in Norway. By contrast, the Danish Central Bank increased rates for the first time in two years in 2016. _Regulatory_ Regulatory initiatives, namely subsidies, tax rate changes and government investments, have an impact on both regulatory macro trends such as GDP as well as on the type and volume of construction and renovation activity. Government subsidies increase the attractiveness of new construction investments as well as RMI works among households and municipalities. In Denmark, the minimum down-payment threshold was preliminarily decreased from 14% to 10% in July 2012, with the ambition to increase the threshold to 14% again in 2017. However, the Ministry of Immigration and Integration has recently submitted a proposal to extend the preliminary period by two more years until 2019. Low down-payment requirements allow municipalities to build more social housing under unchanged budget restrictions, hence generating a positive effect on total construction activity and, ultimately, on the construction materials distribution market. The RMI market is typically able to benefit from European energy policies that have recently aimed to reduce energy consumption in the building sector toward zero carbon emission buildings and stricter European building regulations that also aim to standardize a high quality indoor climate to improve residents’ health. Such European and national building regulations and energy policies are expected to increase the demand for building material products in the Nordics because existing buildings, particularly buildings built in the 1960’s and 1970’s, that are not able to meet these requirements will require renovation. For instance, the Danish government allows tax deductions of up to DKK 12,000 for home-improvement and other RMI expenses, provided that the projects undertaken include a “green” aspect, such as improvements in energy-efficiency. In Sweden, the ROT policy allows a tax deduction of up to 30% of the labor costs incurred in relation to RMI works carried out on one’s property. In Finland, the government offers a subsidy for RMI construction works aimed at improving and promoting home living for elderly or disabled people. Government investments, ranging from social housing to renovations of schools and other public buildings, fuel total construction and renovation activity, thus favorably impacting the construction materials distribution space. The Swedish government has set a target of 600,000 new homes by 2025, and has introduced investment subsidies for the construction of rental and student accommodation. 94 ----- Taxes directly and indirectly impact private household consumption, consequently affecting the degree to which new construction and especially renovation works can be financed. In particular, a reduction in taxes, such as on capital gains, can have a favorable impact on total construction and renovation activity. As an example, the Finnish government offers a tax refund on some customary renovation labor-related expenditures of up to €2,400 each year per person. The refund has been in place since 1997 and is not expected to change substantially in the coming years. _Sector-Specific Trends_ In addition to the growth of the underlying construction materials distribution market, current sector-specific trends are expected to offer additional growth, according to a leading management consulting firm. In particular, the shift towards high-growth SME customers, the growing trend towards urbanization and a change in demographics, the increased penetration of higher-margin own brand products and other key trends are expected to drive future growth in the building material distribution space. SME Growth SMEs, STARK Group’s core customer group, represented approximately 50% of the total Nordic construction materials distribution market’s gross profit pool in 2016, while private consumers, large contractors and other customers accounted for approximately 24%, 13% and 13%, respectively, according to a leading management consulting firm. SMEs are forecasted to outgrow the market in the coming years and generate gross profit growth at a CAGR of approximately 3% between 2016 and 2021, above total market gross profit growth of approximately 1.8%. The change in consumer preferences towards full-service providers is expected to shift growth away from DIY and towards SMEs. The regulatory environment is also expected to favor SME growth, as tax deductions on RMI works in Denmark and Sweden will continue to incentivize the use of SMEs by households when carrying out home renovation or improvement works. In addition, growth in SMEs is further supported by overall improved economic conditions across the Nordics. The Rockwool Foundation found that the share of households who have worked on smaller DIY projects in Denmark has fallen from approximately 49% in 1996 to approximately 37% in 2007 and 24% in 2016. Urbanization and Changing Demographics Internal migration from rural areas and smaller towns towards larger city centers will be one of the key mediumterm drivers of both residential and non-residential construction and renovation activity, according to a leading management consulting firm. In fact, as people move to cities for study or job related reasons, demand for new housing as well as for RMI works on the existing stock is expected to increase. Along the same lines, construction and renovation activity in the public, commercial and industrial sectors will also benefit. According to a leading management consulting firm, the growing urbanization trend underpins the expectation of larger regions and cities to outgrow the rest of the market, thereby representing one of the key reasons behind the shift in growth in favor of distributors with attractive locations closer to large city centers. STARK Group is well-positioned to benefit from such trends, given its footprint is strategically skewed towards attractive growth areas across its four markets. Changing demographics can also affect the growth of the Nordic construction materials distribution market. An aging population tends to lead to a shift away from DIY toward the hiring of SMEs and other of our B2B customers for new build and RMI needs. Management believes since wealth may increase with age, an older population may also be more able and willing to spend on new build and RMI activities than a younger population. Own Brand Penetration Own brand products currently have low penetration in the Nordic construction materials distribution market, but is expected to experience substantial growth in the coming years, according to a leading management consulting firm. Own brand products in the Nordics are estimated by such firm to hold approximately 10% of the relevant market share, which is considerably less than other developed countries, primarily due to the smaller scale of Scandinavian enterprises and a general lack of historical focus on such products. Own brand products have a market share, for example, of approximately 31% in France, 29% in Germany, 22% in the Netherlands and 20% in the United Kingdom. As a result, based on a leading management consulting firm, we estimate own brand products will double their relevant market share in the Nordics by 2020. Future growth is expected to be driven mainly by (i) opportunities for distributors to realize higher margins on average for own brand SKUs as compared to branded SKUs, and (ii) growing customer willingness to purchase own brand products, with more than 50% of customers willing to purchase up to half of their baskets in own 95 ----- brand products. Future growth is expected to be driven to a lesser extent by (i) the ability to differentiate against competitors, (ii) lower reliance on national manufacturer brands, (iii) increased control over product launch and market positioning, and (iv) the opportunity to actively manage the products’ life cycle. According to a leading management consulting firm, the product categories that are expected to be most impacted by the own brand trend are those with a few high-selling SKUs where brand is less important, such as fasteners, paint, clothing, basic building supplies, hand tools and interior joinery. By contrast, the impact on other categories such as power tools, wood and plumbing is forecasted to be milder, primarily due to the brand value and high quality requirements generally associated to these products.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Real estate funds as well as individual citizens are expected to continue to be highly active in acquiring new dwellings given the scarcity of rental housing in Finland. The Norwegian residential new build market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2016 and 2019, according to Euroconstruct. Euroconstruct forecasts high levels of construction activity and increasing housing completions in 2018 and 2019. However, capacity constraints, weak population growth and declining house prices are expected to limit the growth in housing starts over the same period. Non-Residential New Build According to Euroconstruct, the Nordic non-residential new build market will grow at a CAGR of approximately 3.9% between 2016 and 2019, fueled by new constructions in both the public and private sectors. The Danish non-residential new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3.6% over the period from 2016 to 2019, due to the start of a large program of new hospitals, which is expected to drive growth in the coming years. The Swedish non-residential new build market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9.1% between 2016 and 2019, according to Euroconstruct, mainly driven by increased construction in the industrial sector due to growing industrial production, low vacancy rates in office buildings, particularly in the Stockholm area, and higher building activity in the commercial sector such as retail chains, on the back of higher demand due to population growth and higher levels of private consumption. The Finnish non-residential new build market is expected to remain fairly stable, as the volume of vacant space remains high across all building types and in nearly all cities, thus exercising some downward pressure on the market. The Norwegian non-residential new build market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3.9% in the period from 2016 to 2019, supported by a brighter economic outlook, a continued weak currency and low interest rates. Strong growth in new construction in relation to public projects in Norway, primarily new schools and hospitals, will be counterbalanced by a reduction in population growth and overall low levels of capacity utilization in the industrial sector where competitiveness is maintained as a result of the weak Norwegian krone. In addition, improved overall economic conditions in Norway are expected to generate a positive impact on new construction of commercial buildings, such as shopping centers and stores.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

We operate four business units across the Nordics and as of October 31, 2017, we directly operated 66 branches in Denmark, with an additional six branches in Greenland, under our STARK DK business unit, 27 branches in Finland under our STARK FI business unit, 66 branches in Sweden under our Beijer business unit and 14 branches in Norway under our Neumann business unit.

In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, management estimates that we generated approximately 60% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 75% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from RMI activities and approximately 40% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 25% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business from new build activity. Our resilient cash flow during our last three years has also benefitted from our stable gross margin, variable cost structure and effective working capital management. Our variable cost structure has allowed us to reduce labor costs, unwind working capital and reduce capital expenditures during the most recent economic downturn.

As of October 31, 2017, our own brand portfolio comprised 4,110 SKUs spread across our four brands, Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics. We believe we are well-positioned to have the widest own brand offering in the Nordics as a result of our size, scale and level of coordination across countries. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we derived approximately 91% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from branded products and approximately 9% from our own brand products. We support our 179 strategically located branches through our extensive logistics platform, which includes five ship hubs, one light-side hub, five central distribution centers, approximately 120 delivery trucks that we directly operate and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs, allowing for proximity to our customers and harmonized delivery capabilities across the Nordics. Leveraging our broad physical footprint, we offer our customers three distinct sales channels: stock collected by customers inside our branches, stock delivered by us to our customers from our facilities, including weekday delivery within 24 hours in Denmark, and direct delivery by us to customers from the manufacturer’s facilities. To maximize accessibility of our products across all of our markets, we also support our operations through a variety of digitalized customer services under our online sales platforms, including online and mobile phone order, product search and price comparison capabilities. In the year ended July 31, 2017, after our CEO, Søren P. Olesen, stepped into the role of Group-wide CEO from his previous position with STARK DK, we implemented our “Back to Basics” strategy which comprises a number of strategic initiatives to refocus our business on our core SME customer group, reduce sourcing and operational costs, build a more efficient branch and logistics network and streamline our leadership structure by enhancing local decision making and accountability. Management estimates that these programs, together with improvements in the market, have already had a positive effect on our revenue and earnings during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017. As of October 31, 2017, we had 5,056 FTEs and a total headcount of 5,667 personnel, and in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue for the Ongoing Business of €2,183 million and Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business of €109 million, and achieved a Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Ongoing Business of 5%.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

517,Offerings 2018.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.25,Nordic market exhibited strong resilient RMI growth even through economic downturn,18.25.2,Competitive Advantages,"We believe our scale, branch network, logistics platform, full ownership structure and broad customer-centric product and service offering harmonized across the Nordics create competitive advantages and provide us with significant operational advantages compared to our competitors. Our business benefits from an extensive network of 179 branches across the Nordics that are strategically located in areas with high population density and limited available additional real estate, making it difficult for potential competitors to replicate our footprint and customer reach in our core markets. Additionally, operating a company-owned network of branches allows us to harmonize our product assortment and manage our product availability across our business, resulting in superior product assortment and availability in branches and via delivery while simultaneously enabling optimized working capital levels. For instance, STARK DK promises product availability on a certain core range of approximately 1,000 SKUs, which if not available in-branch, will be delivered to our customers in Denmark within four hours and free of charge. Leveraging our scale, we also benefit from significant harmonized sourcing capabilities across the Nordics which allow us to streamline our sourcing efforts and negotiate better pricing terms with our suppliers. We are thus able to provide better pricing to our customers and optimize cost to serve to improve our competitiveness in the market. In addition to our branch network, we fully control an extensive logistics platform consisting of five ship hubs, one light-side hub, five central distribution centers, approximately 120 delivery trucks that we directly operate and a range of third party-owned delivery trucks across the Nordics that we hire depending on our needs, which allows for proximity to our customers and enables us to meet our customers’ demand for flexible collection and delivery services on a national and cross-regional basis. As of October 31, 2017, we had a deep and loyal customer base of approximately 29,000 active customers, which we define as customers who have spent more than €5,000 on our products and services in the year ended July 31, 2017. As of October 31, 2017, we support our customers with a dedicated sales force of more than 850 employees, excluding branch sales staff and office sales support staff, as well as tailored post-sale service offerings, such as credit accounts. We believe that operating a company-owned network of branches allows us to share best customer service practice across branches and provides our customers with consistently high service. Additionally, we believe that we face only a limited threat from pure-play online retailers who lack the physical store footprint to provide the in-person specialist advice that is important to our customers in their purchasing decisions as well as the special infrastructure required to deliver heavy-side building materials, which make up a significant portion of the products we sell. Heavy building materials and timber and panels possess low value to weight ratios, which have historically proved to be unprofitable for pure-play online retailers. We also believe that pure-play online retailers are unable to meet our customers’ requirement for personalized relationships and post-sale services, including our ability to offer customers individualized pricing options and sales discounts, customer credit options, complex logistics solutions, in-branch advice, in-person technical support and quicker access to products, maintenance services and replacement products.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Collectively, this diversification provides downside protection in times of cyclicality and thus comprises key drivers of resilience of our business. We have established strong, long-lasting relationships with a wide range of customers, including SMEs, which comprise our core customer group, as well as large construction companies, private consumers and other types of customers, such as public authorities. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top 20 customers only generated approximately 7% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 3% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business, with the remaining approximately 93% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 97% of gross profit for the Ongoing Business being generated by a long tail of customers, including SME customers for whom STARK Group is a critical supplier. Our fragmented customer base is further diversified in that both small and large customers often have a variety of product preferences and requirements, purchasing from multiple product categories, frequently and in small quantities, making our role as a “one stop shop” for our core customer groups particularly important. 103 ----- In addition to low customer concentration, our business benefits from a diversified mix of sales channels designed to maximize the accessibility of our products, including: (i) stock collected by customers inside our branches, (ii) stock delivered by us to our customers from our facilities, and (iii) direct delivery by us to customers from the manufacturer’s facilities. In the year ended July 31, 2017, we generated approximately 38%, 29% and 33% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and approximately 60%, 27% and 13% of total gross margin for the Ongoing Business from our stock collected, stock delivered and direct delivery channels, respectively. Furthermore, our business benefits from geographic diversification, which enables us to capitalize on the different macroeconomic growth drivers of our core markets of Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway. As the different growth drivers experience peaks and troughs at different times, our business benefits from more stable through-the-cycle revenue generation. In addition, as the Nordic region as a whole may experience a separate economic cycle, our business benefits from resistance to national economic cycles, which is a stabilizing factor with respect to our revenue. Lastly, we are exposed to a diverse supplier base and are not dependent on a single supplier for the operation of our business. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, our top ten suppliers, excluding unmapped suppliers, accounted for approximately 28% of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business, with no one supplier accounting for 10% or more of our total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Furthermore, to streamline administrative functions, in 2016, we initiated significant downsizing at our headquarters, including the relocation of 178 FTEs from our central headquarters to the business unit level to clarify responsibilities and increase accountability and a total planned reduction of 55 FTEs, excluding the hiring of 19 FTEs, expected to be completed by the end of June 2018. We have also initiated (i) further leveraging of our harmonized sourcing platform across the Nordics by rationalizing our supplier base to maximize purchasing power, (ii) the expansion of our own brand offerings to support gross margin development while rationalizing our product portfolio, (iii) the simplification of our distribution network and reduction of our distribution costs and (iv) the optimization of our branch network with an eye toward regions where we have identified growing demand for our products. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Cost Saving and Other Strategic Initiatives.”_ We estimate that we would have realized total annualized run-rate cost savings of approximately €7 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017 through our “Back to Basics” strategy, mainly as a result of better contractual terms following our renegotiation of key supply contracts and as a result of headcount reductions and a more streamlined headquarters if these cost saving measures had been implemented on November 1, 2016. Overall, we have identified approximately €74 million in operational, sourcing- and network-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which we aim to realize by 2021. Additionally, we have initiated several topline growth initiatives, primarily related to product assortment, availability and pricing, which management believes, together with improvements in the market, have resulted in an increase in revenue for the Ongoing Business of approximately 5% during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017.

Our Business Development Director, Daniel R. Potok, who recently joined the Group, brings with him more than 15 years of experience in the professional service sector advising leading Nordic and European builders’ merchants and retailers. Our senior management team is supported by the CEOs and managing directors of each of our business units, comprising a leadership team with significant industry experience. In the year ended July 31, 2017, following a comprehensive review of our leadership position in the Nordic construction materials distribution markets, our customer value propositions and the management of our operations, our CEO together with other members of senior management began implementing our “Back to Basics” strategic plan, incorporating clearly defined cost saving and efficiency initiatives. Our “Back to Basics” initiatives aim to drive our top-line growth by creating a customer centric business model refocusing our operations on our SME core customer group, enhance our profitability by streamlining our headquarters and central administration functions, enforcing crossfunctional collaboration between our headquarters and business units and driving better sourcing initiatives through leveraging our scale, and rationalizing our footprint by exiting unprofitable branches and locations and simplifying our distribution network.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.31,Our Strategy,18.31.1,Better Sourcing,"To reach our objective of developing better sourcing processes, we are implementing a systematic review of our supply chain operations by focusing on three key components: (i) our own brand products, (ii) our direct sourcing costs and (iii) our indirect sourcing costs. We have already begun to implement several initiatives in connection with these key components, the results of which we expect will positively impact our financial position in the near term. Historically, there was a lack of focus on our own brand product portfolio and an excessive overlap of our own brand product proposition with our branded product proposition, with the vast majority of our own brand SKUs not being shared across our business units. By increasing our focus on own brand products, we intend to increase leverage with our suppliers and continue supporting our margins, as own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on average than branded SKUs, according to management estimates. As of October 31, 2017, our own brand portfolio comprised 4,110 106 ----- SKUs spread across our four brands: Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics. We are currently building a strategic common core range of 800 own brand SKUs which will have reduced overlap with our branded products portfolio. Furthermore, following our disposal of our Silvan DIY business and in line with refocusing our business on our SME core customer group, we will continue to reduce the number of our DIY SKUs. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we derived approximately 9% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from own brand products. Based on independent market studies, we estimate that own brand products will double their share of the relevant market in the Nordics by 2020, and in line with this estimated growth, we aim to more than double the share of our revenue generated by our own brand products. Historically, there was a lack of focus on our direct sourcing costs, including as our business units each defined product categories independently and entered into individualized Nordic framework agreements with suppliers. As a result, we only took limited advantage of bundling purchases from suppliers across business units to achieve volume discounts and partially utilized our eSourcing tool, which aims to optimize efficiency and decrease our sourcing spend through various internet-enabled sourcing methods to reduce the time spent on in-person price negotiations, collect pricing data easily and enable high competition among suppliers. In addition, we previously did not track key performance indicators consistently across business units, preventing us from adequately monitoring and driving performance. Consequently, we believe there is significant potential for savings with respect to our direct sourcing costs, and under our “Back to Basics” strategy, we intend to decrease our direct sourcing costs by better leveraging our position as the leading non-franchise builders’ merchant in the Nordics, while building longer term relationships with key suppliers to further reduce costs and ensure the quality and security of the supply for a number of our key products. On August 1, 2017, we launched STARK Group Sourcing, our harmonized sourcing unit across the Nordics, which is designed to maximize sourcing synergies between our business units through a three-step process of (i) rationalizing our suppliers, (ii) rationalizing our product assortment and common core range of SKUs and (iii) improving payment terms with suppliers. We believe STARK Group Sourcing will enable us to benefit from significant economies of scale. Leveraging a “one door” decision making policy, our sourcing unit will continue to conduct best practice and fact-based negotiations with suppliers under direct sourcing campaigns, with the aim of further reducing costs and increasing efficiencies. Historically, there was a lack of focus on our indirect sourcing costs, leading to decentralized sourcing processes and unexploited cost saving opportunities in key indirect sourcing areas such as marketing and logistics, IT and facility management. As part of our “Back to Basics” strategy, we have identified initiatives which we believe will reduce our indirect sourcing costs with minimal effort. Such initiatives include continuing to streamline our supplier base, creating performance-based supplier contracts and improving the management of demand for our products and supplies. We have identified approximately €51 million of sourcing and procurement-related cost savings for the Ongoing Business, which we aim to realize by the year ending July 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

We aim to increase the accessibility of our branches through facility improvements which are tailored to the needs of our customers and trends in our markets and aimed to provide consistent and positive customer shopping experiences. While our business benefits significantly from our current geographic coverage, we may in the future pursue strategic relocations and consolidations of certain branches to better locations along highly travelled roads benefiting from higher footfall or visibility and will assess any new branches that we bring into our network on a case-by-case basis. We continue to monitor our existing branch base to selectively close or merge branches that are performing poorly or otherwise do not meet our expectations. To pursue cost saving opportunities, we have identified several measures which we intend to action in the short term. For instance, we aim to further simplify our distribution network while optimizing our delivery routes and pricing terms by, among other things, establishing additional ship hubs, developing our recently established light-side hub in Denmark to streamline the distribution of slow moving items, downsizing and outsourcing certain of our centralized warehouse processes to achieve cost savings and consolidating the number of dedicated branches used for the distribution of products to better allocate our resources.

Key acquisitions included Beijer in Sweden in 1989, Neumann in Norway in 1997 and Starkki in Finland in 2000. We were acquired in a take-private transaction by CVC in 2003 and sold to Ferguson, which then operated as Wolseley Plc, in 2006. In March 2017, in connection with Ferguson’s strategic decision to refocus its business towards the United States, including by changing its reporting currency and name from Wolseley Plc to Ferguson, Ferguson elected to sell its Nordics business. Ferguson’s Nordics business represented a small part of its larger operations scheme, with its Nordics business receiving less focus than its other business segments.

In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we derived approximately 91% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business from branded products and approximately 9% from our own brand products. 114 ----- _Branded Products_ We stock branded products, including from premium suppliers such as Rockwool, Icopal, Metsä, UPM, DeWalt, Bosch, and Black & Decker. With our logistics network across the Nordics, we aim to offer our suppliers a cost efficient intraregional distribution platform, which includes less populated areas in which our suppliers may not have business operations of their own, thereby differentiating us from our competitors. _Own Brand Products_ The creation and management of our own brand products is a core element of our business strategy, and we estimate that approximately 50% of our target customers are willing to buy half or more of their total basket in own brand products. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by, or incurred costs in procuring, a total number of 4,110 own brand SKUs. As part of our strategy, we aim to build a strategic common core range of 800 SKUs to be sold in each of our four business units and have already launched 173 SKUs for this common core range, have 353 SKUs in our pipeline to be launched by the year ending July 31, 2018 and have the remaining 274 SKUs in our pipeline to be launched by 2020. Our own brand product portfolio contains four brands: Raw, Raptor, Domestic and Basics. - **_Raw: We aim to provide the best quality products for our customers through our premium brand, Raw. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by, or incurred costs in procuring, a total number of 2,251 SKUs under our Raw brand, mainly in the timber and panels, heavy building materials and flooring and joinery product categories. - **_Raptor: We aim to provide good to high quality products for our customers through our mid-tier brand, Raptor. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by, or incurred costs in procuring, a total number of 710 SKUs under our Raptor brand, mainly in the tools and hardware and lightside product categories. - **_Domestic: We aim to provide good to high quality products for our customers through our mid-tier brand for household products, Domestic. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by, or incurred costs in procuring, a total number of 1,140 SKUs under our Domestic brand, mainly in the lightside and flooring and joinery product categories. - **_Basics: We aim to provide good quality, low price products for our customers through our value brand, Basics. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we generated revenue by, or incurred costs in procuring, a total number of nine SKUs under our Basics brand, mainly in the tools and hardware product category. We believe that our own brand products help to differentiate us from other builders’ merchants and general building materials retailers, boost our ability to execute range innovation, control product lifecycles and reduce our dependency on national manufacturer brands and, since they are sold exclusively through our fully company-owned network, permit us to more effectively lead penetration of such products and attract and retain customers of such products over time. In addition, our own brand SKUs have higher gross margins on average than branded SKUs, according to management estimates.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Going forward, we intend to perform our product and range reviews with the preferences of SMEs particularly in mind and to reflect contemporary trends among craftsmen within SMEs as opposed to other customers. Historically, each of our branches were required to have the same base assortment of SKUs but were free to select the remaining assortment autonomously. Customers were only able to easily access the product assortment at their local branch, which held approximately 8,000 to 14,000 SKUs out of a total of approximately 78,000 SKUs across all branches. However, as approximately 20,000 SKUs under this model accounted for 93% of our revenue according to a leading management consulting firm, we sought to create a more efficient sourcing strategy to produce higher working capital and sourcing gains. In recent years, we have invested resources to upgrade our inventory structure to concentrate on availability, service, range and value for money which fit with our customers’ and end-users’ needs. For example, each of our 115 ----- branches in Denmark holds approximately 8,000 to 14,000 SKUs, localized to take into account specific customers’ preferences and needs. In addition, certain of our products, such as our full light-side assortment of approximately 11,500 SKUs, are available for weekday delivery within 24 hours to customers in Denmark. We are also preparing to add an assortment of heavy-side SKUs to this offering, which we anticipate will allow us to make approximately 15,000 SKUs available for weekday delivery within 24 hours to such customers. In addition, we consider which SKUs have low and high selling potential, respectively, based on various customer criteria related to the importance of quality and price and we implement guaranteed availability either in branches or via delivery on our core product assortment subsets based on such analyses to eliminate “out of stock” days. For instance, STARK DK in Denmark promises product availability on a certain core range of approximately 1,000 SKUs, which if not available in-branch, will be delivered within four hours and free of charge. The rationalization of our product assortment to reduce our assortment of SKUs and allow for greater local variance and guaranteed availability of an in-demand core range of SKUs provides us with opportunities for sourcing and working capital advantages.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.38,Share of Revenue for the Ongoing Business Key Product Category** **Types of Products Revenue for the Ongoing Business,18.38.3,Price Positioning,"We aim to deliver a consistent customer experience that reinforces our brand promise and drives sales through positive perceptions of quality, value and choice. We offer a broad range of branded and own brand building material products at what we believe to be a competitive range of prices and through a variety of payment methods, including cash, debit cards and credit cards. We also provide the majority of our customers with short-term credit for which we carry the associated credit risk. We mitigate such credit risk by maintaining credit insurance, and we have historically experienced minimal financial losses from these arrangements. Over the past three years, we have been utilizing a smart pricing strategy, under which we have a dedicated pricing team and smart pricing software. Our pricing strategy has been implemented in phases, which included setting consistent shelf prices, discount structures based on customers’ size and buying profiles, a project pricing software tool and a price guidance software tool. We also use vast market data publicly available to us to price our products at competitive prices and have begun gathering all of our customers’ contracts centrally to better manage our customer pricing terms on a consistent basis over time. Our discount structure facilitates increased sales for trade specific “high runner” and known value products. We offer competitive prices for items purchased frequently and fairer prices for times purchased infrequently, which we believe enhances brand and value perception among our customers to further drive sales growth than in turn will drive movement in inventory. The price increases on infrequently bought items generally offset the margin loss incurred in connection with the price reductions we offer on trade-specific “high runner” products. In addition, the increased sales volumes enable us to negotiate volume-driven discounts from our suppliers, which also have positive effects on our margins. These pricing strategies have historically optimized our total sales and minimized the overall level of markdowns.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.38,Share of Revenue for the Ongoing Business Key Product Category** **Types of Products Revenue for the Ongoing Business,18.38.4,Customer Service,"_General_ We complement our broad product offering with in-branch customer service and technical support, an after-sales service and ongoing product support in relation to the products we sell. Our sales teams are well informed about our products and are trained to use effective and customer-friendly techniques to expertly advise our customers and maximize the probability of converting customer footfall into sales, as walk-in top-up sales remain important to our business model. As a fully company-owned chain, we have and take the opportunity to share best practices across our branches in all aspects of client facing services, including sales, product knowledge and overall customer service. We use multiple methods to monitor the quality of staff performance and customer service, including a management tool to calculate net promoter scores (“NPS”) as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research. We measure and monitor NPS on a daily basis, enabling us to monitor customer satisfaction at the branch level regularly and cater our customer services accordingly. Branch, telephone, mail and internet ordering channels and the options for sales channels enable our customers to access our products at their convenience. We believe that our service proposition contributes to a high degree of customer satisfaction, attracts more people to our branches and other channels and generates customer loyalty, repeat purchases and recommendations to friends and family. _Digitalized Customer Services_ To maximize accessibility of our products across all of our markets, we also support our operations through a variety of digitalized customer services under our online sales platforms, including online and mobile phone order, product search and price comparison capabilities. 116 ----- We believe we have a competitive advantage over pure-play online retailers as they do not have the physical presence and infrastructure required to compete with our immediate product availability and direct sales processes, particularly for heavy building products and timber and panels, that generate and support our online sales to customers. For example, heavy building materials and timber and panels represented 36% and 34%, respectively, of total revenue for the Ongoing Business in the year ended July 31, 2017 and our logistics capabilities, including our physical distribution platform and fleet of crane trucks, allows us to continue to deliver such products to customers quickly and efficiently despite the complexity pure-play online retailers may face with respect to such deliveries. In addition, customers value the possibility to negotiate prices on large orders and the loyalty discounts we offer, and while pureplay online retailers are capable of offering low list prices due to their savings on physical distribution networks, they are not usually capable of negotiating prices on an individual basis which is a key consideration for B2B customers. Furthermore, the possibility to extend credit terms represents a core attraction for trade customers, and pure-play online retailers typically require immediate payment by debit or credit card, and the latter generally allows no more than forty days of credit to the customer. Sales through our online sales platforms generated less than 2% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017. Online sales for B2B builders’ merchants are generally still limited but we expect this channel may grow, as our online sales platforms may increase efficiency for both our customers and our business, offering our customers a potentially quicker and easier method for purchasing our products and also allowing us the opportunity to configure payment and logistics more quickly.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

We pursue an active marketing and sales strategy to offer our customers a one-stop shop with access to an wide assortment of SKUs across brands and manufacturers as well as qualified expert advice on the products we sell based on deep product knowledge. We utilize targeted marketing for each of our business units directed at key customer groups, including SMEs from which we generate the highest proportion of our revenue. For example, we focus our marketing and sales strategies to enhance customer loyalty among SMEs, including by organizing social events, such as golfing, fishing and racing, with such customers.

STARK Group Sourcing is designed to leverage benefits of scale to maximize sourcing synergies between each of our business units through a three-step process of (i) rationalizing our suppliers, (ii) rationalizing our product assortment and common core range of SKUs and (iii) improving payment terms with suppliers. STARK Group Sourcing is operated by a team of 45 full-time equivalents (“FTEs”) supported by an advisory board of seven managers across the four Nordic countries in which we operate. Our advisory board consists of our CEO, business unit CEOs, Chief Procurement Officer and Business Development Director. Leveraging its “one door” decision-making policy, STARK Group Sourcing focuses on strategic sourcing and logistics through best practice and fact-based negotiations, as well as on increasing our own brand product penetration. STARK Group Sourcing has been able to negotiate attractive payment terms with our suppliers, which we strive to continuously improve with the aim of increasing our working capital. In addition to STARK Group Sourcing, we also have dedicated assortment and category management teams in each of our business units. The main responsibility of our assortment and category management teams is to determine the range composition and product selection, product pricing and trading for their respective business unit.

We have achieved certain efficiencies through a rationalization of our supplier base as well as through the application of benchmarking, tendering and other competitive techniques to award contracts. As of October 31, 2017, we worked with more than 3,300 suppliers, which we have identified for rationalization as part of our “Back to Basics” strategy. We spent approximately €2 billion in sourcing activities for the Ongoing Business, before rebates, in the twelve months ended October 31, 2017. We aim to maintain good relationships with our suppliers to ensure we benefit from product innovation, competitive prices and surety of supply. This results in valueadding services for our customers as we are able to procure our supplies with benefits of scale and final authority provided by operating a company-owned network of branches, which enables us to more quickly secure and offer lower pricing. Similarly, our suppliers are provided with value from our procurement and sourcing activities since they receive high volume sales with a single counter-party and thus receive cost-efficient sales since we can purchase full pallets of goods at scale and deliver partial pallets in specified quantities on an as needed basis to customers. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we spent approximately 43% of our sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business on our operations for STARK DK in Denmark, approximately 26% of our sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business on our operations for STARK FI in Finland, approximately 23% of our sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business on our operations for Beijer in Sweden and approximately 7% of our sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business on our operations for Neumann in Norway. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we spent approximately 91% of total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business on supplies for branded products and approximately 9% of total sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business on supplies for our own brand products. We are aiming to expand our own brand offering to increase sourcing spend on these products to support gross margin development for our product offering. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, we spent approximately 37% of our sourcing spend for the Ongoing Business on heavy building materials, 26% on timber and panels, 16% on flooring and joinery, 13% on tools and hardware, 6% on light-side and 2% on other products.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Regional stocking of our products allows for market leading availability for our customers. In addition, strategically located hubs benefit our suppliers without requiring them to introduce capital commitment to store and ship their supplies. We typically receive payment for our inbound logistics costs from our suppliers. As of October 31, 2017, our inbound logistics platform consisted of five ship hubs and one light-side hub, totaling more than one million square meters of warehousing, to serve our network of branches in the Nordics. We also utilize certain of our branches to stock and distribute our products. Two of our ship hubs are located in Denmark, two additional ship hubs are located in Finland and the remaining ship hub is located in Sweden. Our light-side hub is located in Denmark and is used for distribution of products purchased online and of slow moving items. _Sales Channels_ Our sales channels involve the collection, distribution and delivery of our products. We aim to offer our suppliers a cost efficient distribution platform, which includes less populated areas in which our suppliers may not have business operations of their own. We aim to offer our customers flexibility with respect to their desired delivery type and timing as well, including cost efficient deliveries on a consistent basis and convenient proximity of product collection points. We typically receive payment for our sales channel costs from our customers or such costs are embedded in our product prices. We offer the following sales channels: - **_Stock collected: Stock collected relates to goods available as stock and purchased or collected by customers inside our branches. Such goods are often reflective of smaller orders and one-off purchases by smaller construction companies and private consumers. Stock collected typically generate gross margins between 118 ----- 25% and 29% as this sales channel involves a higher margin product mix, including tools and hardware, and value-added potential from large product assortment and availability within branches, as well as higher exposure to higher margin RMI activities. - **_Direct delivery: Direct delivery relates to goods that are delivered directly from the manufacturer to the customer and therefore not recorded in our stock. We act as distributors for such goods and do not incur delivery costs relating to such goods, resulting in the lowest cost-to-serve of these three sales channels. Such goods are often reflective of large construction needs of national as well as regional and local B2B customers. Direct delivery typically generates gross margins between 5% and 15%, as large order volumes can lead to discounts and lower purchasing power with manufacturers and as this channel typically has higher exposure to lower margin new build activities. - **_Stock delivered: Stock delivered relates to goods purchased by customers and held as stock in our branches or distribution centers prior to being delivered to customers, with delivery of certain products completed within 24 hours during weekdays in Denmark from the time of purchase. Such goods are often reflective of orders by national, regional and local B2B customers. Stock delivered typically generate variable gross margins depending on the country of operation and type of customer contract, including as a result of mixed exposure to RMI and new build activities. As of October 31, 2017, our sales channels involved 179 branches, including six branches in Greenland, across the four Nordic countries in which we operate as well as five central distribution centers located in Brønerslev, Tommerop, Aarhus, Stockholm and Helsinki.

As of October 31, 2017, we worked with more than 3,300 suppliers, at least approximately 42% of which were located in Denmark, at least approximately 7% of which were located in Finland, at least approximately 16% of which were located in Sweden, at least approximately 13% of which were located in Norway, at least approximately 3% of which were located in the rest of Europe and at least approximately 0.1% of which were located in the rest of the world, with the remaining 18.9% currently unclear due to data procurement issues. We conduct business with our suppliers under Nordic or local cooperation agreements, Nordic or local own brand agreements and trade agreements depending on whether we are sourcing branded products or own brand products. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, approximately 36% of our sourcing spend was incurred under Nordic agreements, approximately 47% of our sourcing spend was incurred under local agreements and approximately 0.1% of our sourcing spend was incurred under trade agreements. Approximately 17% of our sourcing spend was incurred without a framework agreement in place. _Agreements with Suppliers for Branded Products_ For the sourcing of branded products, we use a central contract management system that produces a standardized supplier contract in English or the local language. The applicable law for such contract is the law of the lead business unit entering into the contract. The template supplier agreement consists of (i) commercial terms, (ii) legal terms and (iii) a supplier manual. The ability to include non-standardized terms is limited and requires prior approval from, in the case of commercial terms, the relevant sourcing director for the business unit in question and in the case of legal terms, various Group legal teams. Typical terms of these contracts include terms governing termination, the assignment of contractual rights, payment, rebates and indemnities and delivery dates, some of which allow for different options to be agreed by the supplier and the business unit party thereto. Certain of our supplier contracts include a tiered pricing scheme, which we negotiate to garner higher discounts on larger volumes of product purchases. 119 ----- The supplier manual sets out certain administration, delivery and packaging instructions applicable to all of our suppliers. We aim to purchase materials from suppliers that develop and produce products that have high brand recognition for our branded products, are of high quality and use leading technology. We require that all our suppliers agree to satisfy minimum requirements under our code of conduct, including with respect to quality assurance standards, and we work with them to ensure that they understand the importance of our code of conduct. We manage our relationships with suppliers across our business through regular meetings, senior management engagement and strategic follow-ups. Our finance team checks all supplier agreements before approving them for payment through our finance system, and reports any contracts with unauthorized, non-standardized terms to our legal team for review. _Agreements with Suppliers for Own Brand Products_ For the sourcing of own brand products, we use the same central contract management system to produce a similarly standardized supplier contract but with an additional schedule of terms providing information and specifications concerning our own brand products. _Agreements with Suppliers in China_ For the sourcing of products from China, STARK Group Sourcing enters into direct or wholesale agreements with suppliers in China that are standardized but different from our standard contracts used outside of Asia. Agreements with suppliers in China reflect local requirements and cultural norms. In connection with our separation from Ferguson as part of the Acquisition, we no longer source from China through an affiliate of Ferguson. When sourcing from China, our business units liaise with a dedicated department that places orders from the business units under framework agreements with the local Chinese suppliers, advises on compliance with import and export requirements and facilitates arrangements with freight forwarders.

Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and 158 ----- minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Management estimates that the Guarantors (other than the Issue Date Guarantor) accounted for at least 80% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and at least 80% of Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, and held at least 80% of our total assets as of July 31, 2017. Management estimates that the subsidiaries of the Target that will not be Guarantors accounted for less than 20% of total revenue for the Ongoing Business and less than 20% of Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, and held less than 20% of our total assets as of July 31, 2017. Within 120 days following the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to certain adjustments and the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer is required to ensure that the Guarantors (other than Bidco) accounted for at least 80% of (i) total revenue for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA for the Ongoing Business for the year ended July 31, 2017 and (iii) total assets as of July 31, 2017. As of October 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Target’s subsidiaries that will not be Guarantors would have had no third-party debt outstanding. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

The Escrow Account and the Issuer’s rights under the Escrow Agreement will be pledged on a firstpriority basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to an escrow account charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account, (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, at a time that is on or before the Escrow Longstop Date, an Officer’s Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall conclusively rely, without further investigation or liability, to the effect that: - prior to, or substantially concurrently with the release of the Escrowed Property, the Equity Contribution will be made; - the Acquisition will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Acquisition Agreement, promptly following release of the Escrowed Property, except for any changes or other modifications that will not, individually or when taken as whole, have a material adverse effect on the Holders (as determined in good faith by the Issuer); - immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, (i) the Issuer will own, directly or indirectly, the entire share capital of the Target (excluding any de minimis amounts held by managers or directors of the Target or its Affiliates, if any) and (ii) LSF10 Wolverine Holdings S.à r.l. and LSF10 Wolverine GP S.à r.l.

The Collateral (other than the Escrow Charge over the Escrow Account) will be granted, in each case, to the Security Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the Security Documents, creating an effective Security Interest over the relevant assets. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first priority security interests over the Collateral securing the Notes are contractually deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the extent that such security 161 ----- is expressed to secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) certain obligations under hedging arrangements and (iii) certain other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes, following the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security interests.

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit; - the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) related to granting the relevant guarantee and/or security (including in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security; - the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they are not wholly-owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group;

- the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document); - the agreement it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets; - any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security document; provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is material and will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy; - the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantees and that security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group; - the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Event of Default which is continuing), and the agreement that any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles; and - the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or in China, Lithuania, the Faroe Islands and Greenland (the “Excluded Jurisdictions”) or otherwise over the shares of a member of the Group located in an Excluded Jurisdiction.

Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the date of completion of the Change of Control Triggering Event, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility that permits the Revolving Credit Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of 173 ----- borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority_ in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional _Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date_ or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event; provided, however, that such Change of Control offer is conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Authority and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status.

(3) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof; (4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing; (5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(9) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and (10) the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred and Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that may be issued pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and clause (13) of the second paragraph of this covenant by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed the greater of (x) €50.0 million and (y) 46% of LTM EBITDA at any one time outstanding. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Issuer or a Guarantor will not Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the relevant Notes Guarantee, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that for purposes of the Indenture, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior Lien basis, secured on different collateral or guaranteed by different obligors, or by virtue of the application of “waterfall” or other payment ordering provisions affecting tranches of Indebtedness. 179 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), with a purchase price in excess of the greater of (a) €15.0 million and (b) 14% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents (provided, however, that in the case of Asset Dispositions involving the disposition of non-core assets at fair market value (each, as determined by the Issuer in its good faith judgment) acquired as part of any acquisition after the Issue Date in which the value of such non-core assets does not exceed 50% of the consideration payable in connection with such acquisition, only 50% of the consideration therefor must be in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents); and (3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied: (a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects (i) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), any Senior Secured Indebtedness or any other Indebtedness under any Credit Facility Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 450 days from the later of (x) the date of such Asset Disposition and (y) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; provided further that, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase any Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary shall be under no obligation to redeem, repay or purchase a pro rata portion of the Notes, (ii) to (A) purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise or (B) redeem Notes pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture;

provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (a “Commitment”); provided _further that if any Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount_ is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds; or 189 ----- (c) to consummate any combination of the foregoing; _provided that, (1) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_ accordance with clauses (a), (b) or (c) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture and (2) the Issuer (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net Available Cash attributable to any given Asset Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above with respect to such Asset Disposition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 451st day after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash (or (i) such earlier date as the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries may elect or (ii) such later date as set forth in clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant), if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds €25.0 million, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders issued under such Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and to repay, prepay or purchase any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and not more than 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and which may include in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt, such higher price as may be contemplated by the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, and with respect to the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in Euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro-equivalent amount determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Issuer may, at its 190 ----- option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euro that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Euro. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (a) €35.0 million and (b) 32% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); (6) consideration consisting of Additional Assets; and (7) any combination of the consideration specified in the preceding clauses (1) through (6). To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. The Revolving Credit Facility may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

(6) failure by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €30.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”); (7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to a material portion of the Collateral for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security Interest, with respect to a material portion of the Collateral, created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30 days; and 202 ----- (8) any Notes Guarantee by a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any Notes Guarantee limitations and the Agreed Security Principles). Notwithstanding any other term of this “Description of the Notes” or the Indenture, no Permitted Reorganization shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in, a breach of any undertaking or other term in this “Description of the _Notes” or the Indenture, or a Default or an Event of Default, and shall be expressly permitted under the terms of this_ “Description of the Notes” or the Indenture. However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6), the Issuer does not cure such Default within 60 days after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events _of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if_ the Event of Default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; 203 ----- (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 150 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year ending July 31, 2018 and within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal years thereafter beginning with the fiscal year ending July 31, 2019, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous fiscal year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate. “Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of: (1) Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period; (2) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series of Preferred Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary of such Person during such period; and (3) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series of Disqualified Stock during this period. “GAAP” means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. “Guarantee” means, any obligation, contingent or otherwise, of any Person directly or indirectly guaranteeing any Indebtedness of any other Person, including any such obligation, direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise, of such Person: (1) to purchase or pay (or advance or supply funds for the purchase or payment of) such Indebtedness of such other Person (whether arising by virtue of partnership arrangements, or by agreements to keep-well, to purchase assets, goods, securities or services, to take-or-pay or to maintain financial statement conditions or otherwise); or (2) entered into primarily for purposes of assuring in any other manner the obligee of such Indebtedness of the payment thereof or to protect such obligee against loss in respect thereof (in whole or in part), _provided, however, that the term “Guarantee” will not include (x) endorsements for collection or deposit in the ordinary_ course of business or consistent with past practice and (y) standard contractual indemnities or product warranties provided in the ordinary course of business, and provided further that the amount of any Guarantee shall be deemed to be the lower of (i) an amount equal to the stated or determinable amount of the primary obligation in respect of which such Guarantee is made and (ii) the maximum amount for which such guaranteeing Person may be liable pursuant to the terms of the instrument embodying such Guarantee or, if such Guarantee is not an unconditional guarantee of the entire amount of the primary obligation and such maximum amount is not stated or determinable, the amount of such guaranteeing Person’s maximum reasonably anticipated liability in respect thereof as determined by such Person in good faith.

If the Acquisition is not consummated or the other conditions to release of the Escrowed Property (as defined herein), as more fully described below under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory _Redemption” have not been satisfied, on or prior to July 31, 2018 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence_ of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

Assuming the Completion Date occurs on or prior to the Business Day immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date and the Escrowed Property is released from the Escrow Account, the Target and certain of its Restricted Subsidiaries will enter into one or more supplemental indentures to become a party to the Indenture and will guarantee (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) the Notes on a senior secured basis upon the earlier of (i) the date such entities guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) 120 days from the Completion Date. Prior to the Completion Date, neither the Issuer nor the Issue Date Guarantor will control the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Completion Date, the Target and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such non compliance will not constitute a default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Completion Date. The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law and the terms of the Indenture, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Fixed Rate Notes (the “Additional Fixed Rate Notes”) and additional Floating Rate Notes (the “Additional Floating Rate Notes” and together with the Additional Fixed Rate Notes, the “Additional Notes”); provided that if the Additional Fixed Rate Notes are not fungible with the Fixed Rate Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the Additional Floating Rate Notes are not fungible with the Floating Rate Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, respectively, such Additional Fixed Rate Notes or Additional Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code or other identifying number, as applicable, from the Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, originally issued. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens. See “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Except as otherwise_ 153 ----- provided for in the Indenture, each of the Fixed Rate Notes (together with any Additional Fixed Rate Notes) and Floating Rate Notes (together with any Additional Floating Rate Notes) will constitute a separate series of Notes, but shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver or other modification of the Indenture, redemption and offers to purchase or any other action by the Holders hereunder. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes and any Additional Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture. The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Finance Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents will be available from us upon request on and after the Issue Date. The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility_ of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of the Notes, does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income.

In such a case, subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount of interest on a Note (which includes any foreign tax withheld) will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes. In addition to interest on the Notes, you will be required to include in income any Additional Amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld. You may be entitled to deduct or credit this tax, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any Additional Amounts) generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest received, determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such stated interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or 259 ----- periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period; - the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or - the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election. Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment.

Your adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. If you purchased your Note with euro, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euro, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition.

An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, you have held the Note for more than one year.

Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the Note.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue prices that appear on the cover of this offering memorandum for each of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the Offering’s price for each series of Notes and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through United States registered broker dealers. In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that: - the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions by their counsel; - during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 60 days after such date, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries or other affiliates will, without the prior written consent of Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt (including, without limitation, any debt securities, loans or other debt instruments), issued or guaranteed by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes); and - the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Certain affiliates of the Issuer may purchase a portion of the Notes in the Offering. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. During this 40 day period, neither Clearstream nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act. In addition, as Nykredit Bank A/S and its affiliated are not registered with the SEC as a U.S. registered broker-dealer, it will effect offers and sales of the Notes solely outside of the United States. The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market making activities will be 263 ----- subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next successive business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own advisor. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors. Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of Notes. See “Notice to Certain Investors.” Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will perform, banking, investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for the Issuer and its affiliates, for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and reimbursement of expenses. In particular, Danske Bank A/S currently provides transaction banking, cash management, trade finance and leasing services to certain Group companies, namely Stark Danmark A/S, DT Finland Oy, Neumann Bygg AS and Beijer Byggmaterial Aktiebolag. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the 264 ----- Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of the Issuer, the Group, such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. 265 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the centre of main interests “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the centre of main interests of a debtor, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. Recital 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the presumption should be rebutted where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. A debtor’s centre of main interests is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If the centre of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If the centre of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the threemonth period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under of the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. 266 ----- Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States (other than Denmark) so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

Following such a request, the Commercial District Court having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings in the event that the Issuer (a) has ceased to make payments (cessation de paiements) and (b) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If the Commercial District Court considers that these conditions are met, it may open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion, absent a request made by the Issuer or a creditor. If the Commercial District Court declares a company bankrupt, it will appoint one or more bankruptcy receivers (curateur(s)), depending on the complexity of the proceedings and a supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to supervise the bankruptcy proceedings. The period within which creditors must file their proof of claims (déclaration de créance) is specified in the judgment adjudicating the company bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may nevertheless be taken into account by the bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to distributable proceeds. 267 ----- The bankruptcy receiver takes over the management and control of the Issuer in place of the managers. The bankruptcy receiver will realize the Issuer’s assets and distribute the proceeds to the Issuer’s creditors in accordance with the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds left, to the bankrupt company’s shareholders. The bankruptcy receiver represents the Issuer as well as the creditors collectively (masse des créanciers). The bankruptcy receiver will need to obtain of the Commercial District Court permission for certain acts, such as agreeing to a settlement of claims or deciding to pursue the business of the Issuer during the bankruptcy proceedings.

In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial (intuitu _personae agreements) for the other party. However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by law, such as_ employment contracts, unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. Contractual provisions purporting to terminate a contract upon bankruptcy are generally held as being valid. The receiver may choose to terminate contracts of the company subject to the rule of “exceptio non adimpleti contractus” and the creditors’ interest. Unsecured claims of the Issuer (such as the Issuer’s liabilities under the Notes) will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer, only rank after (i) the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and (ii) the debts of the Issuer that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, inter alia: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors of the Issuer (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized and subject to application of the relevant priority rules, liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law). During insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors of the Issuer are suspended. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is fixed by the Luxembourg court and dates back not more than six months as from the date on which the Luxembourg court formally adjudicates a company bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period.

An application for controlled management can only be made by the Issuer. The loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) is identical to the credit test applied in bankruptcy proceedings. As to the second criteria (that is, the case where a company is not in a position to completely fulfil its obligations), a broad view of the total situation of the Issuer is taken. Controlled management proceedings is only available for good-faith debtor. Controlled management proceedings are rarely used as they are not often successful and generally lead to bankruptcy proceedings. They are occasionally applied to companies, in particular holding or finance companies, which are part of an international group and whose inability to meet obligations results from a default of group companies. The proceedings are divided into three steps: (i) The Issuer must file an application with the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court can reject the application because (i) the Issuer has already been declared bankrupt or (ii) the evidence brought forward by the Issuer does not ensure the stabilization and the normal exercise of the Issuer’s business or improve the realization of the Issuer’s assets in better conditions. If the application is upheld at this stage, the Commercial District Court will appoint an investigating judge (juge délégué) to make a report on the overall situation of the Issuer. (ii) Once the investigating judge has delivered a report, the Commercial District Court may (i) turn down the application on the ground that the proposals made by the applicant are unlikely to lead to the reorganization of the business or the realization of the assets in better conditions or (ii) appoint one or more administrators (commissaires) who will supervise the management of the assets of the Issuer. If the Commercial District Court ascertains that the Issuer is unable to pay its creditors (i.e. the Issuer has ceased its paiements (cessation de paiements)), it may set the date as from which the Issuer will be deemed to have been in such situation. Such date may be set up to six months prior to the filing of application for controlled management proceedings. However, bankruptcy may only be declared if the two conditions for bankruptcy are met (cessation of payment (cessation de paiements) and loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit)), and if the application has been dismissed either before or after consideration of the report by the investigating judge or after the reorganization plan proposed by the administrators (commissaires) at the third step described below. The administrators will draw up the inventory of the assets as well as the financial situation of the Issuer. They are also in charge of the annual accounts of the Issuer. The administrators may also prescribe any act they consider to be in the interests of the applicant or its creditors. The administrators have to be convened to any meeting of the board of directors or of managers. They may attend all board meetings but have no voting rights. They have the right to convene such board meetings. (iii) The administrators will draft a reorganization plan in respect of the applicant’s business or a plan for realization of the assets, within the deadlines set forth by the Commercial District Court. The plan shall equitably take into account all interests involved and will comply with the ranking of mortgages (hypothèques) and privileges (privilèges) as required by law, without taking into account any contractual clause regarding termination, penalties or acceleration. The administrators will notify the draft plan to the 269 ----- creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. Within fifteen days of such notification or publication, the creditors will inform the Commercial District Court whether they agree or object to the draft plan. Any creditor who abstains will be considered as having adhered to the plan. The creditors, the company, the joint debtors and the guarantors may submit written observations to the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court may (i) approve the plan if a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the Issuer’s liabilities have agreed thereto or (ii) disagree with the plan proposed by the administrators even though a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the company’s liabilities have agreed to such plan, in which case the application for controlled management will be dismissed or (iii) ask the administrators to propose an amended plan (such amended plan will have to be submitted again to the creditors). The judgment approving the plan will be binding upon the company and its creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. The fees of the administrators will be fixed by the Commercial District Court and will be borne by the company. The administrators who at the same time are creditors of the applicant are not entitled to any fees. _Effects of A Controlled Management Proceedings_ As from the day of the appointment of the investigating judge and up to the final decision on the application for controlled management, any subsequent enforcement proceedings or acts, even if initiated by privileged creditors (including creditors who have the benefit of pledges (gages) and mortgages (hypothèques)) are stayed, save as provided for by the Collateral Act 2005. The Issuer may not enter into any act of disposition, mortgage and contract or accept any movable asset without the authorization of the investigating judge. Once the administrators have been appointed, the Issuer may not carry out any act (including receiving funds, lending money, granting any security, or making any payment) without the prior authorization of the administrators. The administrators may bring any action before the Commercial District Court in order to have any act made in violation of the legislation governing the controlled management or in fraud of the creditors’ rights be set aside. Subject to the prior authorization of the Commercial District Court, they may bring an action (i) to have the directors, managers or the statutory auditor be held liable or (ii) if the Commercial District Court has declared the company to be in cessation of payments, to have certain payments, compensations or security interests be set aside (under certain conditions set forth in Articles 445 et seq. of the Luxembourg code of commerce).",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Preventive composition proceedings may only be applied for by a company which is in financial difficulty. Similar to controlled management proceedings, the preventive composition proceedings are not available if the company has already been declared bankrupt by the Commercial District Court or if the company is acting in bad faith. The application for the preventive composition proceedings can only be made by the Issuer and must be supported by proposals of preventive composition. The Commercial District Court will delegate to a delegated judge (juge délégué) the duty to verify, and to prepare a report on, the situation of the Issuer. Based on such report, the Commercial District Court will decide whether or not to pursue the preventive composition proceedings. If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure should not be pursued, it will in the same judgment declare the bankruptcy of the company (which bankruptcy may also be declared during the preventive composition proceedings if the conditions for the composition proceedings are not met). If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure may be pursued, it will set the place, date and hour of a meeting (assemblée concordataire) at which the creditors will be convened. The delegated judge will make its report at the assemblée concordataire. The preventive composition may only be adopted if a majority of the creditors representing, by their unchallenged claims, three-quarters of the Issuer’s debt, has adhered to the proposal and if the preventive composition has been homologated by the Commercial District Court. Creditors benefiting from mortgages (hypothèques), privileges (privilèges) or pledges (gages) only have a deliberating voice in the operations of the concordat, if they renounce the benefit of their mortgages, privileges or pledges. The vote in favor of the concordat entails renunciation. The renunciation may be limited by the secured creditors to only a portion (but representing at least 50% in value) of their claims with corresponding voting rights. 270 ----- The preventive composition has no effect on the claims secured by a mortgage, a privilege or a pledge and on claims by the tax authorities. If the application results in a preventive composition arrangement sanctioned by the Commercial District Court, the preventive composition could still either be annulled (if it has not been executed) or terminated (in case of fraud or bad faith of the company). In such scenarios, the Commercial District Court may adjudicate bankrupt the Issuer. The bankruptcy judgment can decide to set the date of cessation of payment to the date of the application for the preventive composition proceedings. If that date is less than six months prior to the bankruptcy judgment, the court can of course set the cessation of payment date at six months prior to its judgment. Preventive composition proceedings are rarely used in practice since they are not binding upon secured creditors. _Effects of a Preventive Composition Proceedings_ The Issuer’s business activities continue during the preventive composition proceedings. While the preventive composition is being negotiated, the Issuer may not dispose of, or grant any security over, any assets without the approval of the delegated judge. Once the preventive composition has been agreed by the Commercial District Court, this restriction is lifted. However, the Issuer’s business activities will still be supervised by the delegated judge. Except as provided for in Collateral Act 2005, while the preventive composition is being negotiated, unsecured creditors may not take action against the company to recover their claims.

It can only be applied to a company which, as a result_ of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily cease its payments but which has on the basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of payments may also be granted if the situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious elements of reestablishment of the balance between its assets and its debts. The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking experiencing financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding involving both the Commercial District Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority of the creditors representing, by their claims, three-quarters of the company’s debts (excluding claims secured by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)). The suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons it has lost its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed by the debtor prior to obtaining the suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and other public charges or secured claims (by right of privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are concerned. _Effects of Suspension of Payments Proceedings_ During the suspension of payments, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings against the Issuer or the Issuer’s assets. This stay on enforcement does not extend to preferred creditors, or to creditors which are secured by mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial collateral arrangements governed by the Collateral Act 2005. The Issuer continues to manage its own business under the supervision of a court-appointed administrator who must approve most of the transactions carried out by the Issuer. When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the Issuer’s managers can run the business again.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of pledges over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, preferred equity certificates in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares (such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies), preferred equity certificates, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of pledges depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge over registered shares in a Luxembourg company must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the pledge) and/or (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge under a receivables pledge agreement will be validly created and perfected provided that the pledge under such receivables pledge agreement is executed by the parties thereto. However, if the debtor has not been notified of such receivables pledge or if it did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, it will be validly discharged of its obligations if it pays the pledgor. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required. Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited to: - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties; - sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (if listed shares) or (iii) by way of a public auction; - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the pledges might be substantially delayed. The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges and transfer of title by way of security) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during the hardening period, against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting any one of the parties. The perfection of the pledges created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). 272 ----- Foreign law governed security interests (such as the escrow charge) and the powers of any receivers/ administrators may not be enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/ arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where the relevant Luxembourg security provider or Luxembourg guarantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if ‘main insolvency proceedings’ (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights _in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies in accordance with_ article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Finally, the appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending on the type of security interests. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Collateral Act 2005, a financial collateral may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral takers, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined.

In a Danish bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors based on a priority of claims. Such liquidation may not yield the same value to the creditors as a reorganization and sale of a going concern. As a general rule, the debtor or (provided it has the necessary legal interest) any creditor may present a petition for bankruptcy. A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied that the debtor is insolvent based on a statement of the debtor’s liquidity status and that the insolvency is not of a purely temporary nature. A bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the event of the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security. If there is probable cause for the creditor to believe that avoidable transactions have occurred, it may serve as required legal interest, provided that the creditor is able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with a certain degree of certainty. If bankruptcy proceedings are commenced, payments under the Notes may be delayed and may not be made in full. Provisions on avoidance and set off may adversely affect the enforcement of rights under the Notes. Security interests (except for those qualified as “håndpant eller anden tilsvarende sikkerhedsret” under the Danish Bankruptcy Act (Konkursloven)) may only be enforced by the bankruptcy trustee, however, mortgagees and execution creditors may demand enforcement of such security interests six months after the declaration of bankruptcy, always provided that such security interests are valid and duly perfected. 273 ----- Danish insolvency law also includes a scheme for reconstruction of insolvent companies. In broad terms, this scheme provides for reconstruction of an insolvent company by transfer of the business in full or in part and/or a compulsory composition/moratorium. During the reconstruction procedure, creditors are restricted in their ability to enforce their claims; however valid security may be enforced under certain conditions (including security interests that are qualified as “håndpant eller anden tilsvarende sikkerhedsret” under the Danish Bankruptcy Act (Konkursloven)). If a restructuring procedure fails, bankruptcy proceedings will be initiated against the debtor. The Danish bankruptcy scheme is based on the fundamental principle of pari passu satisfaction of the debtor’s unsecured creditors. However, claims against the debtor are subject to priority ranking, giving first priority to costs incurred during the bankruptcy proceedings or claims according to agreements affirmed by the bankruptcy trustee, including the fee for the bankruptcy trustee. Second rank is given to claims incurred during any preceding restructuring proceedings and other costs incurred with the approval of any reconstructor. Third rank, “privileged claims,” are mainly certain salary claims, including holiday pay, salary income taxes (relating to salary claims being filed) and salary claims payable in the period of six months of the onset of insolvency but excluding salary claims from management. Fourth rank is given to suppliers to the debtor who have, within twelve months of the onset of insolvency, delivered goods to the debtor with the applicable duties paid (or to be paid) by the relevant supplier, but only (i) as regards certain specifically listed duties, and (ii) to the extent that the relevant supplier has a claim for reimbursement of the duties prepaid. After fulfilment, if any, of these priority ranking claims, in the above order, any excess proceeds will be distributed among all ordinary, unsecured and unsubordinated creditors. Interest accrued on ordinary, unsecured and unsubordinated claims will rank as ordinary claims up to the date of the bankruptcy order, after which date the accrued interest will rank as a deferred claim. Deferred claims also include, among others, certain liquidated damages, subordinated loans and penalties. In the event of bankruptcy, claims in foreign currencies will be converted into Danish krone using the relevant currency rate as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The status of a claim is dependent upon express statutory authority (except for subordinated loans).",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Some avoidance provisions require the payment or security to be granted within six or three months, as applicable, before the date of the bankruptcy (or the reconstruction) petition being filed (referred to as “the reference date”). In some cases, however, avoidance can be claimed for payments or security granted within two years or more before the date of the reference date. Under Danish bankruptcy law, payments of debt made by a Danish group company could be void if such payments are made (a) later than three months before the reference date (i) by unusual means of payment, (ii) before the normal due date or (iii) in an amount that has a distinctly impairing effect on such Danish group company’s ability to pay its debts, always provided such payment does not appear to be ordinary, and where such payment has been made for the benefit of a party closely connected to such Danish group company, it may be void if the payment has been made later than two years before the reference date, unless it is substantiated that such Danish group company neither was nor became insolvent at the time of making the payment; or (b) after the reference date, unless such debts are settled under the rules on the order of priority of creditors in bankruptcy, payment was necessary to prevent a loss or the persons for whose benefit the payment was made neither knew nor ought to have known that a petition for bankruptcy (or reconstruction) had been filed. Granting of security could be void under Danish bankruptcy law if, among other things (i) security for the debts was not granted to the creditor before or at the time the debt was incurred; or (ii) security was not perfected no later than without undue delay after the time the debt was incurred, and where such security was made on behalf of a party closely connected to such Danish group company, it may be void if the security has been granted later than two years before the reference date, unless it is substantiated that such Danish group company neither was nor became insolvent at the time of making the payment. The timing requirements in respect of granting of security and perfection are interpreted very strictly under Danish law and “undue delay” in practice means as soon as practically possible. A general avoidance rule applies under Danish bankruptcy law, pursuant to which any transaction, including payments and security, which in an improper way favors a creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the debtor’s assets are prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the debtor’s debts are 274 ----- increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be void if the Danish group company was (or by way of the transaction) became insolvent and the party favored knew or ought to have known about the insolvency and the circumstances that made the transaction improper. In general, only transactions which are contrary to common norms of correct and decent business behavior will be deemed improper, and improper behavior is normally associated with breaching the purpose of insolvency proceedings (e.g., when a creditor ought to realize that a given transaction will deprive the other creditors of their right of satisfaction). Furthermore, there is no limitation in time applicable to this avoidance rule and it can in principle be applied for an unlimited period of time. Under Danish bankruptcy law the issuance of guarantees may be subject to avoidance if, among other things (i) the issuance was made at a time when the issuer was insolvent, (ii) the issuance is without due consideration, and/or (iii) between closely related parties. A claim for avoidance can be made against the main debtor or against the beneficiary.

This is due to a requirement under Danish law that the management of the company must always ensure a proper management of the company’s assets. Further, the management of the company is obliged to act in accordance with the company’s individual interests, including consideration of the company’s financial position, the benefits the company will obtain through and the risks related to the granting of security or guarantee, assessment of the debtor, securing that the arrangement is on market terms, etc. If such benefit is not obtained, the directors of a Danish guarantor or security provider may be subject to civil liability and/or the guarantee or security may be null and void. It is not entirely clear under Danish case law to what extent such corporate benefit is established when a subsidiary guarantees and secures debt of a direct or indirect parent company. The Danish Companies Act furthermore contains restrictions on financial assistance by Danish limited companies. Generally, a Danish company may not, directly or indirectly, advance or make funds available to, or grant loans to, or issue guarantees or provide security for, any of its shareholders, or any of the shareholders in its, direct or indirect, parent company or in any other company which exerts a decisive influence in respect of the Danish company. However, Danish companies may advance or make funds available to, or grant loans to, or issue guarantees or provide security for, Danish and certain foreign parent companies which are covered by Danish Executive Order No. 275/2010 (on loans etc. to foreign parent companies) which includes any entity in the corporate form of (a) a public limited company (aktieselskab), (b) a limited partnership with a share capital (partnerselskab), (c) a private limited company (anpartsselskab) or (d) a foreign company with an equivalent corporate form, having its registered office in the EU or EEA or any country categorized 0 or 1 in OECD’s country risk classification, including USA. In addition to the general restriction on financial assistance, a Danish company is generally prohibited from advancing or making funds available, granting loans, guarantees or security in connection with the financing or refinancing of a third party’s acquisition of, or subscription for, shares in the Danish company or shares in the Danish company’s direct or indirect parent company and any such loan, guarantee, security or other financial assistance will be invalid and unenforceable. To the extent that any such acquisition debt cannot be separated from other (non-acquisition) debt, such other debt may be deemed acquisition debt and any loans, guarantees, security or other financial assistance provided by a Danish company for such other debt may then also be invalid or unenforceable. The prohibition on financial assistance also extends to non-Danish subsidiaries of Danish companies even if, under the local financial assistance and other laws otherwise applicable to such non-Danish subsidiaries, the relevant guarantee or security could validly be granted. If loans, guarantees, security or other financial assistance are provided in violation of the prohibitions above, such loans, guarantees, security or other financial assistance will be invalid and unenforceable and must be repaid together with interests.

Rules have been enacted in the Danish Capital Markets Act (lov om _kapitalmarkeder) allowing representatives to hold security, and exercise authority and rights in relation thereto, on_ behalf of noteholders and the Security Agent may be appointed as representative pursuant to the Danish Capital Markets Act (lov om kapitalmarkeder) and, in accordance therewith, should be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet) to ensure effective representation. There is not yet any case law relating to this legislation confirming the right of the representative to enforce on behalf of the holders of the Notes so there is a risk that enforcement may be delayed. The Collateral governed by Danish law will be perfected by the Issuer in favor of the Security Agent and some of the Collateral may only be perfected after the occurrence of certain events of default or other perfection triggers. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may not be able to enforce its rights in the Collateral against the security provider’s creditors, including a bankruptcy administrator who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. The same principle applies with respect to any third party acting in good faith, provided that such third party has complied with the relevant act of perfection. In general, Danish law stipulate (as an overall principle on perfection) that a security provider must be deprived possession of control over the relevant assets that are subject to security and such dispossession must be effective at all times. If dispossession is not effectively upheld, the security may be extinguished. A Danish court may find that a security interest in dividend rights and voting rights granted pursuant to a share pledge agreement has not been perfected until the parties secured by the share pledge have given notice to the relevant company that the voting rights and dividend rights pledged under the share pledge agreement may be exercised only by the secured parties or a security agent acting on their behalf. Upon perfection, the security interest in dividend rights and voting rights may be deemed to be security for pre-existing debt and, thus, as regards those rights be subject to a hardening period and avoidance following perfection. The same principle applies to security interest over other assets, e.g. bank account in respect of which the security provider is authorized to freely make withdrawals, release and transfer funds and receivables (including subordinated claims) in respect of which the security provider is authorized to freely receive payments, waive and amendment the terms and conditions thereof and exercise rights in respect of thereof. A Danish court may find that security of receivables must be perfected in accordance with the law of the country where that receivable is deemed to be located (the lex rei sitae rule). It is unresolved under Danish law if a receivable is deemed to be located at the domicile of the debtor of the creditor, thus it cannot be ruled out that security over receivables in respect of which a Danish company is a debtor or a creditor will be subject to Danish perfection requirement notwithstanding that the governing law of the receivable between the parties thereto is not Danish law (and vice versa). Under Danish law, the ranking of security rights is determined by the date on which the relevant act of perfection has been taken, and if a security interest created later in time over that same Collateral, but in respect of which the act of perfection is completed prior to perfection of the pre-existing security interest then the security interest created later will have priority (provided that the third party beneficiary, other than creditors, acts in good faith). 276 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

In the event of a bankruptcy of a Swedish company the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (Sw. _konkursförvaltare) who will work in the interest of all creditors of the company with the objective of selling the_ company’s assets and distribute the proceeds among the creditors. The bankruptcy estate is deemed to constitute a separate legal entity. The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the company as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds in accordance with the mandatory priority rules as primarily set out in the Swedish rights of priority act, as amended (Sw. _Förmånsrättslagen (1970:979)) (the “Rights of Priority Act”).

A declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in bankruptcy may in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing contracts.

Kronofogden) or the courts. Upon obtaining an enforcement order against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim. In respect of pledges over certain other types of assets, such as over shares, receivables, bank accounts, trademarks and contractual rights, enforcement can be carried out by the security holder itself. A provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement is typically included in any pledge agreement between the security provider and the secured party or its agent. The secured party is typically entitled to enforce the security through a sale of the collateral. However, certain restrictions apply to the procedure for such a sale. In general, when enforcing the security, the secured party is under a duty of care in relation to the security provider and the security granted. This duty includes, inter alia, an obligation to notify the security provider of any liquidation or sale of the collateral, to account for the proceeds of such liquidation or sale, and to pay to the security provider that portion of the proceeds of such liquidation or sale which exceeds the debt secured by such asset. The security provider should, if the circumstances are not exceptional, be given prior notice of the contemplated enforcement and also of the time and location of the sale. Furthermore, sufficient notice should be given to prospective purchasers in 277 ----- order to create reasonable preconditions for a market price being obtained in the sale. Where the secured party has been granted the right to enforce the security through a private sale, such sale must be made to a party unaffiliated with the secured party unless the market price of the security can be independently and objectively established prior to or shortly after enforcement and the security is sold at such price. Pledges over receivables and other claims are, if the receivable or claim has fallen due, normally enforced through the secured party collecting the payment as opposed to selling the receivable. Certain categories of assets (such as real property) may however only be enforced through the Swedish Enforcement Authority. Enforcement of security in bankruptcy is also subject to certain restrictions. A holder of a real property mortgage, a business mortgage or security over specific assets in the possession of the relevant security provider may demand that the relevant assets are sold by the receiver in bankruptcy without undue delay, provided that the underlying claim is not disputed or has been confirmed in a non-appealable decision. This rule does however not apply to such assets as are necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s business. The receiver in bankruptcy may thus postpone such sale if the receiver in bankruptcy determines that the bankruptcy estate would either incur a considerable loss or that the implementation of a public composition proceeding (Sw. offentligt ackord) would become substantially more difficult, provided that a postponement is not unreasonable to the secured party. A secured party holding a possessory pledge over moveable property (such as shares) may arrange for the sale of the moveable property at a public auction (but not sell the moveable property privately unless the receiver in bankruptcy consents). Such secured party must however give the receiver in bankruptcy an opportunity to arrange payment of the debtor’s debt to the creditor in order to redeem the moveable property to the bankruptcy estate, and the moveable property may not, without the consent of the receiver in bankruptcy, be sold earlier than four weeks after the oath administration meeting (Sw. edgångssammanträde) held as a part of the bankruptcy proceedings. However, financial instruments and currency are exempt from the requirement for the receiver in bankruptcy’s consent.

As a general principle, under Swedish insolvency law competing claims have equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However, some preferential and secured creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law, have the benefit of payment before all other creditors (in the case of preferential creditors only) and before all unsecured creditors out of the assets that secure the creditors’ claims (in the case of secured creditors only). There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights. Specific preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor a right to payment from such separate property. General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the debtor’s estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a preferential right to payment. Claims that do not carry any of the above mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other (unless subordinated). A claim can be subordinated if, for instance, the creditor has entered into an agreement with the debtor stipulating such subordination. It should be noted that, in the case of bankruptcy, claims in relation to the bankruptcy estate (a legal entity separate from the debtor) due to costs relating to the bankruptcy (including fees payable to the receiver in bankruptcy), may have priority over claims in relation to the debtor.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Lag (1996:764) om företagsrekonstruktion) provides companies facing difficulties in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve these difficulties without being declared bankrupt. A petition for company reorganization may be presented to the court by the company or a creditor of the company but a reorganization order may only be granted subject to the company’s approval. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may under certain conditions be extended for up to one year. An administrator (Sw. rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the company. However, the company remains in full possession of the business except that the consent of the administrator is required for important decisions, such as paying a debt that has arisen prior to the granting of a reorganization order, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the granting of the reorganization order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the company’s business. However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the transaction (but may jeopardize the reorganization). Upon the opening of company reorganization proceedings, the administrator must notify the creditors of the reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the proposed action to be taken to resolve the company’s difficulties. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the opportunity to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any of the creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors’ committee of a maximum of three persons. The administrator shall, if possible, consult with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions. The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts entered into by the company. However, the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings entails limitations in the contracting party’s right to terminate a contract due to the company’s delay in payment or performance. Such limitations are similar to that which is stated above in respect of a bankruptcy estate’s right to step into existing contracts. The limitations are not applicable where a creditor has security over, inter alia, financial instruments or receivables originating from a loan granted by a credit institution. During the reorganization procedure, the company’s business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the company may not pay a debt that arose prior to the granting of the reorganization order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the company will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a Swedish law pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company provided that the share certificates of such company has been delivered to the secured creditor or its agent and with a Swedish law pledge over a loan governed by a negotiable debt instrument (Sw. löpande skuldebrev) where such negotiable debt instrument has been delivered to the secured creditor or its agent. During reorganization proceedings, the company may apply to the courts requesting public composition proceedings (Sw. offentligt ackord) which means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced on a percentage basis. The proposal for a public composition must meet certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are allowed to vote, in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set-off rights and preferred creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set-off rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The public composition is binding on all creditors that were entitled to participate, i.e. also creditors who have not attended the creditors’ meeting will be bound. However, the obligations of a guarantor under a guarantee provided in respect of a creditor’s claim which has been reduced by way of public composition will not be reduced correspondingly but will remain valid up to the original amount of such creditor’s claim.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type. Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the secured party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event would therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security interests have been perfected. Security interests that are subject to such delayed perfection stand the risk of being subject to clawback claims whereby the security interest might be held invalid and unenforceable. In the case of shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the share certificates endorsed in blank to the possession of the pledgee. The pledgee is not entitled to vote for the shares but is, absent agreement to the contrary, entitled to any bonus shares and any new shares issued in rights issues. Unless the pledgee and the security provider agree otherwise, the security provider is entitled to all dividends until the bankruptcy date. The right to future dividends can however be pledged to the pledgee or to a third party. As set out above, any security purported to be created over, inter alia, (i) future shares before such shares are issued and/or (ii) dividends after a certain triggering event, will not be perfected from the outset and may as such be vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

The above restriction does not, however, apply to providing credit to or guaranteeing or providing security for the obligations of a parent company or another company within the same “group.” This exemption must be read in conjunction with the group definition in Section 1-3 of the Acts which, broadly speaking, includes Norwegian limited liability companies. Furthermore, there is an exemption for providing credit to or guaranteeing or providing security for the obligations of any legal entity which has “decisive influence” over the company as mentioned in Section 1-3 of the Acts provided that the credit, security or guarantee is granted in order to benefit the financial interest of the group of companies. Section 1-3 defines “decisive influence” as holding or otherwise controlling at least a majority of the voting shares in the company or having the right to elect or discharge a majority of the members of the board of directors of such company. In practice, this exception will be applicable to a Norwegian wholly owned subsidiary of a foreign company provided that the credit, security and/or guarantee is established in order to benefit the financial interest of the group of companies. In addition to the restrictions with regard to, among others, upstream and cross-stream guarantees and security as outlined above, Section 8-10 of the Acts prohibits a Norwegian private or public limited liability company from providing financial assistance (including putting assets at disposal, granting loans or providing security or guarantees) in connection with the acquisition of its shares or in connection with the acquisition of shares in a parent company (including any intermediate parent company) unless the value of such financial assistance is within the company’s distributable reserves and, provided further, that satisfactory security for repayment has been established, the financial assistance is provided on ordinary business terms and principles and that the acquisition is of fully paid shares. Furthermore, before such assistance is granted, certain procedural rules must be complied with. The board of directors shall ensure that the beneficiary parties are subject to a credit assessment and the board will be required to prepare a statement which, inter alia, describes the background for and the terms and consequences of the financial assistance. Such statement will have to be presented to the general meeting of the company, which in turn must approve the financial assistance. The practical restriction in respect of financial assistance referred to above applies irrespective of whether such parent company is a Norwegian or a foreign company, and there are no general exemptions available except for special cases of real property financing and employee share purchase programs. The restriction applies not only to the granting of loans, guarantees and security, but also to making assets available and other transfers that are not lawful distributions in accordance with the Acts. The assistance is restricted if made in connection with the acquisition of shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition (such as the refinancing of an acquisition loan facility or the subsequent merger of the target company and the acquiring entity). This means that in practice a Norwegian guarantor cannot give credit, guarantee or provide security for any loans which have been used to finance the acquisition of the shares of the Issuer, a parent company (including any intermediate parent company) or the Norwegian guarantor. As a consequence of these restrictions, the value of the Notes Guarantees and any security provided by a Norwegian guarantor may be reduced to zero to the extent it secures obligations relating to the acquisition of shares in itself or its parent company. In addition, the Notes Guarantees or security interest infringing the limitations set forth in Section 8-10 of the Acts will be void, and any funds paid out will have to be repaid. Finally, an illegal arrangement of this kind may give rise to directors’ liability issues. The Notes Guarantees and the security interests provided by Norwegian companies are subject to limitation language substantially in the form as follows: “The obligations and liabilities of each Guarantor incorporated in Norway (each, a “Norwegian Guarantor”) for the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes Guarantees, shall be deemed to have been given only to the extent such guarantee does not violate Section 8-7 and/or 8-10 of the Norwegian Limited Companies Act of June 13, 1997 No. 44 or the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act of June 13, 1997 No. 45 (as the case may be) (the “Norwegian Companies Act”), regarding unlawful financial assistance and the liability of each Norwegian Guarantor will only apply to the extent permitted by such provision of the Norwegian Companies Act. Such limitations on the liabilities and obligations of any Norwegian Guarantor may have the effect of reducing the amount of obligations or liabilities assumed and/or the amount guaranteed or secured to zero, to the extent to which any proceeds under the Senior Secured Notes are used in connection with the acquisition of shares in the Norwegian Guarantor or its parent. The limitations set forth in these sections will apply mutatis mutandis to any security created by a Norwegian Guarantor over the Collateral and to any guarantee, indemnity, any similar obligation resulting in a payment obligation and payment, including, but not limited to, set-off and made by any Norwegian Guarantor.” 282 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of the debtor’s assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of transactions (including the securing of existing claims) made prior to bankruptcy, (iv) the handling of the debtor’s contractual relationships and (v) the distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are continued, they are formally continued at the risk of the bankruptcy estate, but in practice at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors. Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the creditors (holding or pretending to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy. There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its debt as it becomes due (the “cash flow test”), and (ii) the debtor must be in “deficit” (the company’s debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values) (the “balance sheet test”). During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor’s assets are seized and controlled by the court-appointed liquidator (usually a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor’s assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors. All of the debtor’s assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held by third parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner, or if the acquisition lacks legal protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights with respect to the seized assets, including, but not limited to, the realization of assets. Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle, realize the security, and cover their claims; however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and other holding legal rights in the assets. Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the estimated value or sales value of all assets secured by the debtor for its own debt or by a third party for the debtor’s indebtedness (limited to the Norwegian Court Fee (presently being in the amount of NOK 1130) multiplied by 700 for each such asset registered in an asset register). Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act No. 17/2004 (the “Financial Collateral Act”) or the Norwegian Liens Act No. 2/1980 section 6-4(9). Any under-secured amount (any amount exceeding the value of the secured assets) will be deemed an ordinary (unsecured) trade claim. In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority: - secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset – either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate); - super-priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator’s costs and obligations of the estate); - salary claims (within certain limitations); 283 ----- - tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations); - ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims); and - subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims). Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the three- to twelve-month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for existing debt and transactions at an undervalue. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’ claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Further, the initiation of company reorganization proceedings is possible – in theory, irrespective of the company’s solvency situation – when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts, and who are not related to the debtor, file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company reorganization.

The suspensions are in force until the company reorganization program has been confirmed by the district court or the proceedings have been dismissed.

The company reorganization program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt. Consequently, the company reorganization procedure could result in holders of the Notes receiving a right to recover considerably less than they would otherwise be entitled to recover under the Note Guarantees. Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, insofar as the value of the security at the commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. Regarding business mortgages, only 50% of the value of the mortgaged property will be considered as secured debt. The value of the property will be determined by the reorganization program. The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs second; or (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security. Payments on a secured debt shall be determined so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed one-half of the original credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, a court will take into consideration the length of the remaining credit period, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

If the application is approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) of the bankruptcy estate (pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by the court. A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and use the proceeds received therefrom in payment of the creditors’ claims. In order to achieve the objective of bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decisionmaking powers of the creditors. 285 ----- As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a “claim letter”), by delivering it to the estate administrator no later than the deadline set by the estate administrator. The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a creditor with a secured claim. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of and within a time limit set by the estate administrator, provide the information on receivables and collateral that should be provided in a claim letter. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over the assets of the debtor as security of a claim against the debtor in bankruptcy or a debt owed by some other debtor shall file the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act 120/2004, as amended, (Konkurssilaki). If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, a value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a claim letter. Creditors have an equal right to a payment from the funds of the bankruptcy estate in the proportion of the amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, the following creditors have precedence over unsecured creditors to receive their claims: (i) secured creditors and holders of retention rights have priority to the proceeds relating to the relevant asset; (ii) creditors of the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, creditors with claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceeding; and (iii) creditors with claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive prior to other claims a disbursement of 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets. The rights of the above-mentioned preferential creditors may adversely affect the interests of holders of the Notes. Bankruptcy of the Finnish Guarantor could result in holders of the Notes recovering considerably less than they would have otherwise been entitled to recover under the Note Guarantees. Finnish law prescribes claims that are to be settled lastly. In practice, the most significant of such claims are the interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the bankruptcy, a bond issued with a low priority and a subordinated loan. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds. However, secured creditors that are secured pursuant to a security over movable or immovable property (excluding business mortgage, which requires a separate judgement) may exercise their right to enforce such collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale for a maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate only if the creditor protected by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

According to the Finnish Company Reorganization Act and the Finnish Enforcement Code 705/2007, as amended, (Ulosottokaari), the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied in company reorganization and enforcement proceedings. The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator in the company reorganization and certain creditors may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor’s counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors, 286 ----- (b) places property beyond the reach of other creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty of the transaction knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction. Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii) the granting of security. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit. When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the bankruptcy estate or the debtor. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that had been paid for the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable property. Accordingly, the validity of the Note Guarantees or any payment made thereunder may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. If the granting of a Note Guarantee or a payment thereunder is successfully challenged, then the granting of such Note Guarantee could be nullified or the payment recovered. As a 287 ----- result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of a Note Guarantee, and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to a Note Guarantee could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Pursuant to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a Contracting Party, will be enforceable in Sweden if it meets the following requirements: (a) a motion for enforcement has been filed with the relevant district court (Sw. tingsrätt) as provided by law and has been granted; (b) that no appeals lie against the judgment entered in the courts of such contracting state; (c) that the courts of such contracting state had jurisdiction; (d) that summons has been duly served on the respondent in the proceedings before the courts of such contracting state; (e) that the judgment is not irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the State in which enforcement is sought; and (f) that the judgment does not contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the public policy of Sweden. A judgment entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not, under the terms of the 2012 Brussels Regulation or the Lugano Convention, a Member State (as defined in the 2012 Brussels Regulation) or a Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention), for example, the United States, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without a retrial on its merits. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by the courts of such state, would not be directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden. However, there is Swedish case law to indicate that such judgments: (a) that are based on contract which expressly acknowledge the jurisdiction of courts outside Sweden; (b) that were rendered under observance of due process of law; (c) against which there lies no further right to appeal; and (d) the recognition of which would not manifestly contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the public policy of Sweden, should be acknowledged without retrial on its merits. In order to enforce any such judgement in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden. In such an action, a judgment rendered by the courts of such state may be regarded as evidence of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of the relevant foreign law, but the competent Swedish authority may also choose to rehear the dispute ab initio. Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability, the translation into Swedish of any relevant document. Further assistance from Swedish authorities in the service of process in connection with foreign proceedings might require the observance of certain procedural and other regulations. Swedish courts may award judgments or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but the judgment debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgment debt (even though denominated in a foreign currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment (however, the judgment creditor may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert such local currency into the foreign currency after payment and remove such foreign currency from Sweden), and a choice of currency provisions by the parties to an agreement may not be upheld by Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish kronor. It is not established by Swedish judicial precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of a service of process agent, can be made irrevocable and therefore any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the Swedish Party giving such powers. 296 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Section 4-6, of the Norwegian Dispute Act (Tvisteloven) or the recognition and enforcement of such judgments are otherwise accepted under Norwegian law. However, such judgments may be admissible as evidence in the courts of law, executive or other public authorities of Norway and may in such capacity carry persuasive authority depending on the merits of the judgment without a retrial on its merits. The foregoing could imply, inter alia, that a judgment by a U.S. court would not be recognized or enforceable in Norway as a matter of right. A judgment against an Issuer or any Guarantor in the courts of a state which is, under the terms of the Lugano Convention, a “contracting state” (as defined in the Lugano Convention) or a state with which Norway has entered into a convention on the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments, and judgments rendered by a court whose jurisdiction have been expressly agreed to and accepted by the party, in writing and in a particular civil matter, in accordance with the Norwegian Dispute Act, and such judgments for which the recognition and enforcement is otherwise accepted under Norwegian law, would be recognized and enforceable in Norway, but only insofar as such recognition and enforcement would not be in breach of mandatory law or contrary to public policy in Norway. Only creditors of a claim may have active judicial standing in a Norwegian court; therefore, a security agent or other representative of the creditors may seek enforcement of a claim but such claim may have to be supported by the actual creditors of such claim.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.5,Finland,27.5.1,,"We have been advised by our Finnish legal counsel that there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Finland. Courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system. As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation for actual losses and damages as proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims presented lies with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is very limited. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings. 297 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements Basis of Preparation,27.47.1,,"The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements include Stark Group A/S (the ‘Company’) and its wholly owned subsidiary undertakings (collectively, the ‘Group’). The consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended 31 October 2017 have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (IAS 34) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and adopted by the European Union. The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets that are measured at fair value. The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the presentational currency of the Group. The accounting policies of the Group are described in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 July 2017 and have been applied consistently in these unaudited consolidated interim financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

IFRS 16 will impact the majority of the Group’s operating lease arrangement as each lease will give rise to a right of use asset, which will be depreciated on a straight-line basis, and a lease liability, with the related interest charge. This will replace existing lease balances on the balance sheet and charges to the income statement. The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however the impact will depend on the transition approach and the contracts in effect at the time of adoption. It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Group’s consolidated financial results. There are no other new accounting standards that have been issued but not adopted in these unaudited consolidated interim financial statements that are expected to have a material impact of the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements.

However, the Group stopped preparing consolidated financial statements in the subsequent financial year, following the Group’s acquisition by Ferguson Plc (‘Ferguson’) in October 2006, as these were no longer required. Since its acquisition by Ferguson, the Group’s IFRS financial information was prepared and consolidated into the IFRS financial statements of Ferguson Plc, the Group’s ultimate parent and for a few years for DT Group Holding A/S, the Group’s intermediate parent.

Acquisition related costs are expensed. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, negative goodwill, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. If the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities subsequently differ from the values calculated at the time of the acquisition, adjustments are made, including goodwill, until 12 months after the date of acquisition and comparatives are adjusted as necessary.

At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the Group income statement. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euros at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the Group balance sheet; profits and losses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant accounting periods. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and are included in the Group’s translation reserve.

Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation and assets under construction are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

517,Offerings 2018.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.135,Stark Group A/S Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,27.135.21,,"IFRS 16 will impact the majority of the Group’s operating lease arrangement as each lease will give rise to a right of use asset, which will be depreciated on a straight-line basis, and a lease liability, with the related interest charge. This will replace existing lease balances on the balance sheet and charges to the income statement. The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however the impact will depend on the transition approach and the contracts in effect at the time of adoption. It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Group’s consolidated financial results. No other issued standard or interpretation would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The result and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to the consolidated statement of changes in equity or the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity, or other comprehensive income, respectively. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered. Tax receivables and liabilities are offset to the extent that there are legal right of set-off, and items are expected to be settled net or simultaneously. The remaining lease obligation is capitalised and recognised in the balance sheet under debt, and the interest element on the lease payments is charged over the lease term to the income statement. All other leases are considered operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. An analysis of the amounts presented as exceptional items in these financial statements is given below: During the years, the Group performed a review of the recoverable amount of branches and the related buildings. The impairment assessment carried out as at 1 August 2014 and as at 31 July 2015, 2016 and 2017 did not lead to recognition of impairment losses. Freehold land and buildings have been pledged to secure borrowings of the Group (see note 16). _Defined benefit plans_ The Group operates defined benefit plans with employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in Sweden and Norway. In the year ended 31 July 2017, the Group disposed of the HR Sandvold business. The Group recognised a total loss on the disposal of €1million. The mandate requires the achievement of a competitive return and high liquidity as regards the placement of excess liquidity. In order to achieve effective management of the Group’s cash, use is made of cash pooling. The Group’s liquidity reserves consist of cash. The Group is insured through the ultimate parent Ferguson Plc, which is insured externally with a high deductible. The Ferguson Plc group has an insurance programme with a lower deductible. Every year a premium allocation is decided for each BU based on the past year’s insurance claims and charged to the Group. subsidiaries and the Company’s Executive Board, Supervisory Board and senior employees and their immediate family members. Related parties also include companies where before mentioned persons have significant interests. _Transactions with related parties_ Transactions with Ferguson plc relate mainly to provision of certain central support services. The Group also participates in the Ferguson Plc share based payment arrangements. In addition, Wolseley Finance (Switzerland) AG a subsidiary of Ferguson plc, granted loans to the Group and the Group participates in the Ferguson Plc group’s cash pooling arrangements. Interest on loans and deposits held within the cash pool are calculated in accordance with respective loan agreements and Ferguson Plc group cash pooling agreements. Interest income and expenses in relation to the cash pooling arrangement and the related party loans are disclosed in notes 4 and 5. During the years, the Group entities entered the following transactions with related parties that are not members of the Group: statements under the Danish Financial Statements Act in the most recent previous financial year, no reconciliation of equity, comprehensive income or cash flows has been presented. As discussed in note 1, the Group prepared consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS in 2006. When applying IFRS 1, the Group has assumed re-adoption of Danish GAAP in accordance with the then current provisions requiring full retrospective adoption of Danish GAAP. This has resulted in reinstatement of goodwill as reported in the 2006 IFRS consolidated financial to cost less cumulative amortisation. Management has determined that the useful life of goodwill under Danish GAAP is equal to 10 years resulting in full amortisation of goodwill as of 1 August 2014. _Exemptions applied_ IFRS 1 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain IFRS. The Group has applied the mandatory exceptions and certain optional exemptions as set out below; The Group has applied the following exemptions: 1. IFRS 3 Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of subsidiaries, which are considered businesses for IFRS, or of interests in associates and joint ventures that occurred before 1 August 2014. Use of this exemption means that the carrying amounts according to the Danish Financial Statements Act of assets and liabilities, which are required to be recognised under IFRS, is their deemed cost at the date of the acquisition. After the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance with IFRS. Assets and liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under IFRS are excluded from the opening IFRS statement of financial position. The Group did not recognise or exclude any previously recognised amounts as a result of IFRS recognition requirements. 2. Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero as at 1 August 2014. 3. IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has not been applied to equity instruments granted before 1 January 2011. For cash-settled share based payment transactions, the Group has not applied IFRS 2 to liabilities that were settled before 1 January 2011. 4. The Group has applied the transitional provision in IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement _Contains a Lease and has assessed all arrangements based upon the conditions in place as at the date of_ transition. _Estimates_ The estimates used by the Group to present these amounts in accordance with IFRS reflect conditions as at the date of transition to IFRS and as of 31 July 2015, 2016 and 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375
517,Offerings 2018.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.136,Critical accounting estimates and judgements,27.136.1,,"In applying the Group’s accounting policies, various transactions and balances are assessed using estimates and assumptions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are held to be reasonable under the circumstances. Should these estimates or assumptions prove incorrect there may be an impact on the following year’s financial statements. The Group believes that the estimates and assumptions that have been applied in these consolidated financial statements would not give rise to a material impact within the next financial year. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The Management has made significant estimates and judgements in the following areas: 1) The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors that provide rebates. Many of these agreements apply to purchases in a calendar year rather than the Group’s financial year, and under certain agreements the rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are made. The Group adjusts the cost of purchases to reflect estimated rebates receivable, which can depend on the projected volume, value and mix of purchases from a vendor through to the end of the qualifying period. Actual rebates receivable from vendors may differ materially from the estimates on which the cost of purchases is based. 2) Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged inventories for which the net realisable value is estimated to be less than the cost. The risk of obsolescence of slow-moving inventory is assessed by comparing the level of inventory held to future sales projected on the basis of historical experience. The actual realisable value of inventory may differ materially from the estimated value on which the provision is based. The Group held provisions in respect of inventory balances at 1 August 2014 amounting to €33 million, €28 million at 31 July 2015, €26 million at 31 July 2016 and €22 million at 31 July 2017. 3) Provision is made for bad debt losses in the respect of the Groups’ trade and other receivables, which are estimated to occur if a customer subsequently is not able to pay. If the customer’s financial condition were to deteriorate, and thus are not able to handle the payments, it may be necessary to make further write down in future periods. In connection with the assessment of whether the Group’s provisions for bad and doubtful debts is sufficient, management analyses accounts receivable, including historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and also takes account of the extent to which protection is provided through credit insurance arrangements. 4) Provisions for legal claims, environmental restoration and onerous leases are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Such provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.",N/A,as_expected,2018,375

The total cost of this restructuring including redundancy payments to affected employees, consulting fees, the write off of inventory, the loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, and the rental, maintenance and other infrastructure costs of maintaining the closed branches, is considered exceptional by virtue of its size and nature. On 2 March 2017, the Group disposed of its Sanvold business. In the development of our Nordic strategy of decentralisation of decision making, a focus on SME customers and the development of our new distribution centre, the Group incurred consulting and advisor costs, which are considered exceptional by virtue of their size and nature. Restructuring represents consulting and other advisor costs incurred in relation to restructuring our head office and STARK Finland which the Group consider to be non-recurring. The gain/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment relates to the gain on sale of Cheapy in Sweden during the year ended July 31, 2016, and the loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment in Denmark. The gain on disposal of businesses represents adjustments to provisions in respect of prior year disposals by STARK Finland.
