1052,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Recent Developments,9.2.1,Refinancing Transactions,"_Tender Offer and any 2025 Secured Notes Redemption_ On January 18, 2024, we commenced a cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) for any and all of our outstanding 2025 Secured Notes, pursuant to that certain offer to purchase, dated as of January 18, 2024 (the “Offer to Purchase”) and the related notice of guaranteed delivery attached to the Offer to Purchase (the “Notice of Guaranteed Delivery” and, together with the Offer to Purchase, the “Tender Offer Documents”). Pursuant to the Tender Offer Documents, we will accept for purchase any and all of the 2025 Secured Notes that are validly tendered (and not withdrawn) or that deliver a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery in connection with the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. ET time on January 30, 2024 (the “Expiration Date”), unless extended or earlier terminated, with the settlement date currently expected to be no later than five business days after the Expiration Date (the “Settlement Date”), subject to all conditions to the Tender Offer as set forth in the Tender Offer Documents having been satisfied or waived, unless extended or otherwise determined by us. The Tender Offer is subject to the completion by us of one or more financing transactions (the “Financing Condition”) and other conditions as set forth in the Tender Offer Documents, but this offering of the Notes and the CEI Term B-1 Loans are not conditioned on the successful completion of the Tender Offer. We cannot assure you that the Financing Condition and such other conditions will be satisfied or waived, that the Tender Offer will be completed or that any failure to complete the Tender Offer will not have a negative effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes. Provided that the conditions to the Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived, we will pay for the 2025 Secured Notes tendered and accepted in the Tender Offer, together with accrued and unpaid interest, on the Settlement Date. 1 ----- We cannot assure you that the Tender Offer will be completed in accordance with its terms, or at all, or that any minimum amount of debt securities will be repurchased pursuant thereto. Nothing in this Offering Memorandum shall be construed as an offer to purchase, or an obligation to purchase, any of the 2025 Secured Notes that are subject to the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is being made solely by means of the Offer to Purchase, and is being made only to the recipients of, and upon the terms and conditions set forth in, the Offer to Purchase. We may amend the Tender Offer in any respect, including waiving any condition to the Tender Offer (including, without limitation, the Financing Condition), subject to applicable law. If, following the Expiration Date, the Tender Offer is not fully subscribed, then we intend to issue a notice of redemption to redeem all of the 2025 Secured Notes less the amount of 2025 Secured Notes tendered on or about July 1, 2024 at the redemption price, expressed as a percentage of principal amount, of 100.000% plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date; provided, however, in the event that at least 90% of the aggregate principal of the then outstanding 2025 Secured Notes are validly tendered (and not withdrawn) or that deliver a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery in connection with the Tender Offer, then, pursuant to the 2025 Secured Indenture, the Company intends to redeem all of the 2025 Secured Notes that remain outstanding following the Tender Offer at a price equal to the price paid to each other holder in the Tender Offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption (the “2025 Secured Notes Redemption”). However, nothing in this Offering Memorandum constitutes a notice of redemption of the 2025 Secured Notes or an obligation to issue a notice of redemption of the 2025 Secured Notes. Following the consummation of the Tender Offer and the 2025 Secured Notes Redemption (if any), we expect to have no 2025 Secured Notes outstanding. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” To the extent we do not have sufficient funds available to tender, redeem, repurchase, defease or satisfy and discharge the 2025 Secured Notes in full, a portion of such indebtedness will remain outstanding. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, we have assumed the full repayment of the 2025 Secured Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer and any 2025 Secured Notes Redemption. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” We cannot assure you that the 2025 Secured Notes Redemption will be completed in accordance with its terms, or at all, or that any minimum amount of debt securities will be redeemed pursuant thereto. _CEI Credit Agreement Amendment_ On January 18, 2024, we entered into an engagement letter (the “Engagement Letter”) with certain financial institutions party thereto, including affiliates of the initial purchasers of this offering of the Notes, pursuant to which such financial institutions agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and syndicate a senior secured term “B” loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.0 billion (the “CEI Term B-1 Facility” and the term “B” loans funded thereunder, “CEI Term B-1 Loans”) to be provided to us as a new incremental term loan facility under the CEI Credit Agreement. Substantially concurrently with the completion of this offering of the Notes, we expect to enter into an amendment to the CEI Credit Agreement (the “CEI Credit Agreement Amendment”) as contemplated by the Engagement Letter. The CEI Credit Agreement Amendment is expected to, among other things, establish the CEI Term B-1 Facility. Neither the completion of this offering of the Notes nor the effectiveness of the CEI Credit Agreement Amendment nor the incurrence of the CEI Term B-1 Loans thereunder is contingent on the completion of the other, so it is possible that this offering of the Notes occurs and the CEI Credit Agreement Amendment and the borrowing of the CEI Term B-1 Loans thereunder does not occur, and vice versa. We cannot assure you that the CEI Credit Agreement Amendment and the borrowing of the CEI Term B-1 Loans thereunder will be completed on the terms described herein or at all, or that any minimum amount of the outstanding the 2025 Secured Notes will be repurchased or redeemed in connection therewith. As the final terms and final size of the CEI Term B-1 Loans have not been finalized, the final terms and final amount of the CEI Term B-1 Loans may differ from those terms set forth herein and any such differences may be significant. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” For purposes of this Offering Memorandum, (a) this offering of the Notes, (b) the effectiveness of the CEI Credit Agreement Amendment and the incurrence of the CEI Term B-1 Loans thereunder, (c) the consummation of the Tender Offer and the 2025 Secured Notes Redemption (if any) using the net proceeds from this offering and the 2 ----- net proceeds of the CEI Term B-1 Loans, and (d) the payment of fees and expenses related to the foregoing are, collectively, referred to as the “Transactions.” _Preliminary Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023_ In a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 18, 2024 (the “January 8-K”), we provided a preliminary unaudited range of our expected operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period ended December 31, 2022. These results are preliminary estimates only, based solely on currently available information and management estimates. We have not finalized our financial statement closing process for the three months ended December 31, 2023 or the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. During this finalization process, we may identify items that would require us to make adjustments to the preliminary unaudited range of expected operating results described in the January 8-K. Our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 will not be available until after this offering is completed, and consequently, will not be available to you prior to investing in the Notes. Our actual financial results could be different from those set forth in the January 8-K and any such differences could be material. Neither Deloitte & Touche LLP nor any other auditors have audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to such preliminary financial data. Accordingly, Deloitte & Touche LLP nor any other auditor expresses an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The estimates included in the January 8-K represent the most current information available to management. The estimates for the three months ended December 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of any future period. As a result, the discussion in the January 8-K constitutes forward-looking statements and, therefore, we caution you that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including possible adjustments and the risk factors highlighted under “Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum and in our other public filings incorporated by reference herein and the more detailed information included or referred to under the heading “Cautionary Statement Regarding _Forward-Looking Statements” of this Offering Memorandum and the other information included in the documents_ incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference herein and therein. 3 -----",,as_expected,2024,174,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Refinancing Transactions\nText: _Tender Offer and any 2025 Secured Notes Redemption_ On January 18, 2024, we commenced a cash tender offer (the \u201cTender Offer\u201d) for any and all of our outstanding 2025 Secured Notes, pursuant to that certain offer to purchase, dated as of January 18, 2024 (the \u201cOffer to Purchase\u201d) and the related notice of guaranteed delivery attached to the Offer to Purchase (the \u201cNotice of Guaranteed Delivery\u201d and, together with the Offer to Purchase, the \u201cTender Offer Documents\u201d).

1052,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Operating Our Business,13.1.1,We face substantial competition and expect that such competition will continue.,"The gaming industry is highly competitive and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate. We compete with a variety of gaming operations, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on Native American reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals at bars, restaurants and truck stops and online gambling and sports betting. We also compete, to a lesser extent, with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sportsbooks, fantasy sports websites, “cruise-to-nowhere” operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. In addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes. In recent years, many casino and online gaming operators, including us, have reinvested in existing jurisdictions to attract new customers or to gain market share, thereby increasing competition in those jurisdictions. In particular, we and other online betting and gaming operators have undertaken extensive marketing campaigns and made significant investments in customer acquisition through pricing and promotional policies. In addition, in response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. The expansion of online betting and gaming in new jurisdictions and the growth of the number of competitors in the online betting and gaming market, the expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties, and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue. These competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance. Our brick-and-mortar operations face increasing competition as a result of the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting, including our own online betting and gaming operations, in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. While we believe that we are well positioned to compete with new entrants to the betting and gaming market through our online betting and gaming offerings, the competitive dynamic is evolving and we cannot assure you that our results of operations will not be adversely impacted by the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting. States that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming, and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future. We also compete with Native American gaming operations in California and other jurisdictions where Native American tribes operate large-scale gaming facilities or otherwise conduct gaming activities on Native American lands, which we expect will continue to expand. Further expansion of legalized casino gaming in jurisdictions in or near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations. Increased competition may require us to make substantial expenditures in marketing, customer development and capital projects to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our online and brick and mortar operations to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities and product offerings. Because a significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and our lease obligations, there can 8 ----- be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund, such expenditures. If we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be negatively affected.",,as_expected,2024,174,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""We compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""We compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers.""}, ""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""We compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: We face substantial competition and expect that such competition will continue.\nText: The gaming industry is highly competitive and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate.

The expansion of online betting and gaming in new jurisdictions and the growth of the number of competitors in the online betting and gaming market, the expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties, and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue. These competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance. Our brick-and-mortar operations face increasing competition as a result of the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting, including our own online betting and gaming operations, in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. While we believe that we are well positioned to compete with new entrants to the betting and gaming market through our online betting and gaming offerings, the competitive dynamic is evolving and we cannot assure you that our results of operations will not be adversely impacted by the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting. States that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming, and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future. We also compete with Native American gaming operations in California and other jurisdictions where Native American tribes operate large-scale gaming facilities or otherwise conduct gaming activities on Native American lands, which we expect will continue to expand. Further expansion of legalized casino gaming in jurisdictions in or near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations. Increased competition may require us to make substantial expenditures in marketing, customer development and capital projects to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our online and brick and mortar operations to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities and product offerings. Because a significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and our lease obligations, there can 8 ----- be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund, such expenditures. If we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be negatively affected.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

For example, a substantial number of the customers of our properties in Las Vegas use air travel. As a result of terrorist acts that occurred on September 11, 2001, domestic and international travel was severely disrupted, which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to our properties in Las Vegas. Visitation to Las Vegas also declined for a period of time following the mass shooting tragedy on October 1, 2017. We cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act, security alerts or war, uprisings, or hostilities in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Ukraine, and/or Syria or other countries throughout the world, and governmental responses to those acts or hostilities, will directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results. For example, a third party that is responsible for our player account management has employees located internationally in countries impacted by such hostility and further negative developments in such countries could negatively impact our digital business. As a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely affected. In addition, natural and man-made disasters such as major fires, floods, severe snowstorms, hurricanes, earthquakes, and oil spills could also adversely impact our business and operating results. Such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities. For example, our property in Lake Charles, Louisiana was closed in August 2020 until December 2022 due to damage resulting from Hurricane Laura. Inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured. In most cases, we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, may be out of our control. In some cases, however, we may receive no proceeds from insurance. Further, if properties subject to our leases with VICI Properties L.P. (“VICI”) and Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc.

In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed.

Our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties\u2019 information security operations. As an example, the Data Incident arose from a social engineering attack on one of our outsourced IT vendors. Advances in computer and software capabilities, encryption technology, new tools, and other developments may increase the risk of a future security breach. As a result of the Data Incident, customer information and other data was accessed by an unauthorized actor. Any future security breach, may also result in customer information or other proprietary data being accessed or transmitted by or to a third party. Despite the measures we have implemented to safeguard our information, including actions taken following the Data Incident, there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information. As a result of the Data Incident, we have become subject to multiple lawsuits and inquiries from state regulators and we may become subject to additional lawsuits, claims and inquiries related to the Data Incident. While the Data Incident did not impact our customer-facing operations, we are unable to predict the full impact of the Data Incident, including any regulatory effects or changes in guest behavior in the future, including whether a change in our guests\u2019 behavior could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations on an ongoing basis. 14 ----- We have cybersecurity insurance to respond to a breach which is designed to cover expenses associated with a cybersecurity incident, including costs related to notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. We also carry other insurance which may cover ancillary aspects of cybersecurity events. While we have submitted claims for insurance coverage relating to the costs incurred as a result of the Data Incident, we are not certain of the extent to which such coverage or third-party indemnification will cover such costs. Any future data security breaches giving rise to a loss, disclosure of, misappropriation of, or access to customers\u2019 or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in additional legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information could damage our reputation, and expose us to additional claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. Any such damages and claims arising from a future breach may not be completely covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

These financial obligations may have important negative consequences for us, including: 17 ----- - limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make payments on our debt and lease obligations; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with debt and rent obligations that are less than ours; - increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, public health emergencies and related public heath restrictions, changes in our industry and economic downturns; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations; - subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, require us to make capital expenditures and limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make other investments; - exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit facilities; and - affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Our operations have been adversely impacted by regulations enacted to limit the spread of viruses. In addition, legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.

We may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, including with respect to technology that we believe to be \u201copen source\u201d. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and the attention of management. If unsuccessful, such litigation could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights, require us to pay substantial damages, subject us to injunctions that prevent us from using certain intellectual property, require us to make admissions that affect our reputation in the marketplace, or require us to enter into license agreements that may not be available on favorable terms, re-engineer our technology or discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings. Finally, even if we prevail in any litigation, the remedy may not be commercially meaningful or fully compensate us for the harm we suffer or the costs we incur. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

The Indenture, the CEI Credit Agreement, the 2025 Secured Indenture, the 2030 Secured Indenture, the 2027 Indenture, the 2029 Indenture and the CRC Secured Indenture include, or will include, covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to do the following: - incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness; - issue redeemable stock and preferred stock; - grant or incur liens; - sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; - make loans and investments; - pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; - enter into transactions with affiliates; and - consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case, an automatic stay goes into effect which, among other things, with only limited exceptions, stays: - the commencement or continuation of any action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy case to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case; - any act to obtain possession of, or control over, property of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate or the debtor; - any act to create, perfect or enforce any lien against the property of the bankruptcy estate; and 32 ----- - any act to collect or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Collateral Agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given or could be delayed under the circumstances). Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for any diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. Generally, adequate protection payments, in the form of cash payments or otherwise, are not required to be paid by a debtor to a secured creditor unless the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, and any adequate protection payments approved by the bankruptcy court are limited to the aggregate amount of diminution in value of the secured creditors’ interest in the collateral occurring after the bankruptcy filing. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case or the length of the delay in making any such payments, whether or when the Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (and all of our other obligations that are secured by the collateral on a first-priority basis), the holders of the Notes would have undersecured “deficiency” claims as to the difference. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code does not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees for such undersecured claims during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. As a result, bankruptcy laws may act to limit the holders of the Notes’ ability to realize upon the collateral and to limit their ability to receive post-bankruptcy interest, fees or expenses or “adequate protection” with respect to any unsecured portion of the Notes. In addition, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will impose certain limitations on the ability of the holders of the Notes to object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing or use of cash collateral (assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place with respect to their liens on the collateral in connection therewith) unless the authorized agent for the lenders under the CEI Credit Facilities opposes or objects thereto. See “Description _of Notes—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”_ In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, holders of the Notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the Notes and all of our other obligations secured by the collateral exceed the value of the collateral available to secure the Notes and such other obligations. No appraisal of the collateral securing the Notes has been made in connection with this offering and the value of the collateral will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. The book value of the collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. We cannot assure you of the value of the collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a sale of the collateral would be sufficient to repay all, or would not be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes and other first-priority lien obligations following a foreclosure upon the collateral (and any payments in respect of prior liens) or a liquidation of our assets or the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantors that may grant these security interests. In any bankruptcy case with respect to the Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, it is possible that a bankruptcy trustee (if one were to be appointed), the debtor-in-possession, any official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in such bankruptcy case or any unsecured creditors, as applicable, will assert that the value of the collateral securing the Notes and all of our other obligations secured by the collateral is less than the principal and 33 ----- other amounts outstanding under the Notes and such other obligations. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy case with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between secured claims up to the value of the collateral securing the Notes and an unsecured claim for any deficiency. In the event of a liquidation or foreclosure, the value of the collateral securing the Notes is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include general economic conditions, the actual fair market value of the collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers and similar factors. The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes also could be impaired in the future as a result of our failure to implement our business strategy, competition or other future trends. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the collateral if they apply certain laws to a proceeding and deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. By its nature, some or all of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. A portion of the collateral may include assets that may only be usable, and thus retain value, as part of our existing operating business. Accordingly, any such sale of the collateral separate from the sale of certain of our operating businesses may not be feasible or of significant value. To the extent that liens, rights and easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us or the Subsidiary Guarantors or constitute senior, pari passu or subordinate liens on the collateral, those third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such encumbrances (including rights to require marshalling of assets) that could adversely affect the value of the collateral located at a particular site and the ability of the Notes Trustee to realize or foreclose on the collateral at that site. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, (i) a lack of entitlement on the part of the Notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses otherwise payable under the Notes and (ii) a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws, in each case, with respect to the unsecured portion of the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses or other amounts had been made on account of the Notes at or before the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes. For these purposes, the value of any collateral that the collateral trustee does not have a perfected security interest in will be zero.",,as_expected,2024,174,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Rights of holders of the Notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.\nText: The right of the Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the collateral securing the Notes upon an event of default is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor prior to or possibly even after the Collateral Agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral.

See \u201cDescription _of Notes\u2014First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.\u201d_ In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, holders of the Notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the Notes and all of our other obligations secured by the collateral exceed the value of the collateral available to secure the Notes and such other obligations. No appraisal of the collateral securing the Notes has been made in connection with this offering and the value of the collateral will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. The book value of the collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. We cannot assure you of the value of the collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a sale of the collateral would be sufficient to repay all, or would not be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes and other first-priority lien obligations following a foreclosure upon the collateral (and any payments in respect of prior liens) or a liquidation of our assets or the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantors that may grant these security interests. In any bankruptcy case with respect to the Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, it is possible that a bankruptcy trustee (if one were to be appointed), the debtor-in-possession, any official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in such bankruptcy case or any unsecured creditors, as applicable, will assert that the value of the collateral securing the Notes and all of our other obligations secured by the collateral is less than the principal and 33 ----- other amounts outstanding under the Notes and such other obligations. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy case with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between secured claims up to the value of the collateral securing the Notes and an unsecured claim for any deficiency. In the event of a liquidation or foreclosure, the value of the collateral securing the Notes is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include general economic conditions, the actual fair market value of the collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers and similar factors. The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes also could be impaired in the future as a result of our failure to implement our business strategy, competition or other future trends. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the collateral if they apply certain laws to a proceeding and deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. By its nature, some or all of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. A portion of the collateral may include assets that may only be usable, and thus retain value, as part of our existing operating business. Accordingly, any such sale of the collateral separate from the sale of certain of our operating businesses may not be feasible or of significant value. To the extent that liens, rights and easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us or the Subsidiary Guarantors or constitute senior, pari passu or subordinate liens on the collateral, those third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such encumbrances (including rights to require marshalling of assets) that could adversely affect the value of the collateral located at a particular site and the ability of the Notes Trustee to realize or foreclose on the collateral at that site. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, (i) a lack of entitlement on the part of the Notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses otherwise payable under the Notes and (ii) a lack of entitlement to receive \u201cadequate protection\u201d under federal bankruptcy laws, in each case, with respect to the unsecured portion of the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses or other amounts had been made on account of the Notes at or before the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes. For these purposes, the value of any collateral that the collateral trustee does not have a perfected security interest in will be zero.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the Indenture, constitute a \u201cchange of control\u201d that would require us to repurchase the Notes, notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase \u201csubstantially all\u201d under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require us to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. See \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014 _Change of Control.\u201d_ In addition, in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, we will be required to offer to purchase a principal amount of the Notes equal to the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales to the extent not invested in our business or used to pay down certain debt. We cannot assure you that we will be capable of paying the purchase price in respect of any such offer at the time require. Our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such offer. Our failure to purchase any such Notes when required under the Indenture would be an event of default under the Indenture.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

All borrowings under the CEI Credit Facilities are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default and the accuracy of representations and warranties subject to certain exceptions. _Interest and fees. Borrowings under the CEI Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option,_ either (a) the forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate term rate published two (2) U.S. government securities business days prior to the commencement of the applicable interest period plus (1) in the case of the CEI Pro Rata Facilities and the CEI Term B Loan, 0.10% and (2) in the case of the CEI Term B-1 Loan, a rate to be agreed (\u201cAdjusted Term SOFR\u201d), subject to a floor of (1) in the case of the CEI Pro Rata Facilities, 0%, (2) in the case of the CEI Term B Loan, 0.50% and (3) in the case of the CEI Term B-1 Loan, a rate to be agreed or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the rate of interest per annum last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the \u201cPrime Rate\u201d in the United States and (iii) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is (x) in the case of the CEI Pro Rata Facilities, 2.25% per annum in the case of any Adjusted Term SOFR loan and 1.25% per annum in the case of any base rate loan, subject to three 0.25% step-downs based on the Company\u2019s total net leverage ratio, (y) in the case of the CEI Term B Loan, 3.25% per annum in the case of any Adjusted Term SOFR loan and 2.25% per annum in the case of any base rate loan, subject to one 0.25% step-down based on the Company\u2019s total net leverage ratio and (z) in the case of the CEI Term B-1 Loan, a rate to be agreed. Additionally, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of any unused commitments under the CEI Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of 0.35% per annum of principal amount of the commitments of all lenders, subject to three 0.05% step-downs based on the Company\u2019s total net leverage ratio. The Company is also required to pay customary agency fees as well as letter of credit participation fees computed at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR revolver borrowings on the dollar equivalent of the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer\u2019s customary documentary and processing fees and charges and a fronting fee in an amount equal to 0.125% per annum of the daily stated amount of such letter of credit. _Mandatory prepayments.

The CEI Credit Facilities are guaranteed by our domestic wholly-owned_ subsidiaries (subject to exceptions, which exceptions include, until the CRC Secured Indenture is not in effect (unless we sooner elect otherwise), CRC and its subsidiaries, as well as immaterial subsidiaries), and is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of the Company and the guarantors, including a pledge of the capital stock of the wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries held by us and the guarantors and 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of the first-tier wholly-owned foreign restricted subsidiaries held by us and the guarantors, in each case subject to exceptions. Each of our and the guarantors\u2019 fee-owned real property and leasehold interests in real property with a fair market value in excess of a dollar threshold set forth in the CEI Credit Agreement and certain other properties are expected to be mortgaged under the CEI Credit Facilities. _Restrictive covenants and other matters. Except during a covenant suspension period as defined in the CEI_ Credit Agreement, the CEI Pro Rata Facilities require compliance on a quarterly basis with (a) a maximum total net leverage ratio test of 7.25 to 1.00, stepping down to 6.50 to 1.00 on December 31, 2024 and (b) a minimum cash interest coverage ratio of 1.75 to 1.00, stepping up to 2.00 to 1.00 on December 31, 2024; provided that, from and after the repayment in full of the CEI Term A Loans, the financial covenants will be tested only to the extent that on the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter the testing condition (which is defined under the CEI Credit Agreement as 25% utilization of the CEI Revolving Credit Facility excluding $170 million of undrawn letters of credit and any cash collateralized letters of credit) is satisfied. For purposes of determining compliance with such financial maintenance covenants for any fiscal quarter, we may exercise an equity cure by issuing certain permitted securities for cash or otherwise receiving cash contributions to our capital that will, upon our receipt of such cash, be included in the calculation of EBITDA for the purpose of such financial maintenance covenants. The equity cure right may not be exercised in more than two fiscal quarters during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters or more than five fiscal quarters during the term of the CEI Credit Facilities. Under the CEI Credit Agreement, we may also be required to meet specified leverage ratios or cash interest coverage ratios in order to take certain actions, such as incurring certain debt or making certain acquisitions. In addition, the CEI Credit Facilities include negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) make non-ordinary course dispositions of assets; (ii) participate in certain mergers and acquisitions; (iii) make dividends and stock repurchases and optional redemptions (and optional prepayments) of subordinated debt; (iv) incur indebtedness; (v) make certain loans and investments; (vi) create liens; (vii) transact with affiliates; (viii) change the business of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries; (ix) enter into sale/ leaseback transactions; (x) enter into 48 ----- negative pledges or restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions and limitations; (xi) change the fiscal year; and (xii) modify subordinated debt documents. 49 -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the “Applicable Authorized _Representative” has the right to direct foreclosures and to instruct the Collateral Agent to take other actions with_ respect to the Shared Collateral, and the Authorized Representatives of other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations have no right to take actions with respect to the Shared Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative will initially be the administrative agent under the CEI Credit Agreement, and the Notes Trustee for the holders of the Notes, as Authorized Representative in respect of the Notes, will have no rights under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to direct the Collateral Agent to take any action with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until it becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative. The administrative agent under the CEI Credit Agreement will remain the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Date”). After the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the Authorized Representative of the Series of Other First Priority Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to the Shared Collateral (the “Major Non_Controlling Authorized Representative”). The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period the applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture or debt document for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations and (b) the Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Priority Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the Indenture or other applicable indenture for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations; _provided_ that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the administrative agent under the CEI Credit Agreement or the Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the administrative agent under the CEI Credit Agreement) has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or any material portion of the Shared Collateral, (2) at any time the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or (3) if the acceleration of the First Priority Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which that Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative (if any) is rescinded in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or other applicable indenture for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations. (a) Only the Collateral Agent will be permitted to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral) and then only on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (b) the Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) and (c) no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will be permitted to, or will be permitted to instruct the Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Shared Collateral (including with 56 ----- respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any Security Document, applicable law or otherwise. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Shared Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or NonControlling Secured Party will be permitted to contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Collateral Agent, Applicable Authorized Representative or Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Collateral Agent to do so. The Notes Trustee and each other Authorized Representative will agree that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the documents governing any First Priority Lien Obligations and other than cash and cash equivalents pledged to secure Credit Agreement Obligations consisting of reimbursement Obligations in respect of letters of credit or otherwise held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to certain provisions of the CEI Credit Agreement or any refinancing or replacement thereof) other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; _provided_ that the foregoing will not be construed to prevent or impair (i) the rights of any of the Collateral Agent or any Authorized Representative to enforce the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) the rights of any First Lien Secured Party from contesting or supporting any other Person in contesting the enforceability of any Lien purporting to secure First Priority Lien Obligations constituting unmatured interest pursuant to Section 502(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any applicable Bankruptcy Law). If a First Priority Lien Obligations Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by any First Lien Secured Party or received by the Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (subject, in the case of any such payments, proceeds or distribution, to the paragraph immediately following), will be required to be applied among the First Priority Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Priority Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Priority Lien Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute and after giving effect to any applicable intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement)) to the security interest of any other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening _Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be_ deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Priority Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, none of the First Lien Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled 57 ----- upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Priority Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if, at any time any Shared Collateral is transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of, in each case, in connection with any enforcement by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of each of the First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged upon final conclusion of foreclosure proceeding; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that (1) if the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (the “DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provisions of any applicable Bankruptcy Law), each First Lien Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or any Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will agree not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless any Controlling Secured Party, or an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate (or consent to the subordination by the Collateral Agent of) its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Priority Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: 1. the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case; 2. the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; 3. if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Priority Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and 4. if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; provided that the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; 58 ----- _provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First_ Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral. If the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor incurs indebtedness in the future that is secured by liens on the collateral that are junior to the liens that secure the Notes, the CEI Credit Facilities, the 2025 Secured Notes and the 2030 Secured Notes, then, upon such incurrence, the Collateral Agent, the Notes Trustee, the administrative agent under the CEI Credit Facilities, the trustee under the 2025 Secured Notes, the trustee under the 2030 Secured Notes, the agent under such new indebtedness and the other parties thereto will enter into a Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement (or a joinder thereto) as to the relative priorities of their respective security interests in the collateral and certain other matters relating to the administration of such security interests.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the \u201cApplicable Authorized _Representative\u201d has the right to direct foreclosures and to instruct the Collateral Agent to take other actions with_ respect to the Shared Collateral, and the Authorized Representatives of other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations have no right to take actions with respect to the Shared Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative will initially be the administrative agent under the CEI Credit Agreement, and the Notes Trustee for the holders of the Notes, as Authorized Representative in respect of the Notes, will have no rights under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to direct the Collateral Agent to take any action with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until it becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative. The administrative agent under the CEI Credit Agreement will remain the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such date, the \u201cApplicable Authorized Agent Date\u201d). After the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the Authorized Representative of the Series of Other First Priority Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to the Shared Collateral (the \u201cMajor Non_Controlling Authorized Representative\u201d). The \u201cNon-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date\u201d is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period the applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture or debt document for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations and (b) the Collateral Agent\u2019s and each other Authorized Representative\u2019s receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Priority Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the Indenture or other applicable indenture for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations; _provided_ that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the administrative agent under the CEI Credit Agreement or the Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the administrative agent under the CEI Credit Agreement) has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or any material portion of the Shared Collateral, (2) at any time the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or (3) if the acceleration of the First Priority Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which that Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative (if any) is rescinded in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or other applicable indenture for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations. (a) Only the Collateral Agent will be permitted to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral) and then only on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (b) the Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) and (c) no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will be permitted to, or will be permitted to instruct the Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Shared Collateral (including with 56 ----- respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any Security Document, applicable law or otherwise. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Shared Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or NonControlling Secured Party will be permitted to contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Collateral Agent, Applicable Authorized Representative or Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Collateral Agent to do so. The Notes Trustee and each other Authorized Representative will agree that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the documents governing any First Priority Lien Obligations and other than cash and cash equivalents pledged to secure Credit Agreement Obligations consisting of reimbursement Obligations in respect of letters of credit or otherwise held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to certain provisions of the CEI Credit Agreement or any refinancing or replacement thereof) other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; _provided_ that the foregoing will not be construed to prevent or impair (i) the rights of any of the Collateral Agent or any Authorized Representative to enforce the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) the rights of any First Lien Secured Party from contesting or supporting any other Person in contesting the enforceability of any Lien purporting to secure First Priority Lien Obligations constituting unmatured interest pursuant to Section 502(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any applicable Bankruptcy Law). If a First Priority Lien Obligations Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by any First Lien Secured Party or received by the Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (subject, in the case of any such payments, proceeds or distribution, to the paragraph immediately following), will be required to be applied among the First Priority Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Priority Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Priority Lien Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute and after giving effect to any applicable intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement)) to the security interest of any other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (such third party, an \u201cIntervening _Creditor\u201d), the value of any Shared Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be_ deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Priority Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, none of the First Lien Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled 57 ----- upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Priority Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if, at any time any Shared Collateral is transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of, in each case, in connection with any enforcement by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of each of the First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged upon final conclusion of foreclosure proceeding; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that (1) if the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (the \u201cDIP Financing\u201d) to be provided by one or more lenders (the \u201cDIP Lenders\u201d) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provisions of any applicable Bankruptcy Law), each First Lien Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or any Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will agree not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the \u201cDIP Financing Liens\u201d) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless any Controlling Secured Party, or an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate (or consent to the subordination by the Collateral Agent of) its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Priority Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: 1. the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case; 2. the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; 3. if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Priority Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and 4. if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; provided that the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; 58 ----- _provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First_ Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral. If the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor incurs indebtedness in the future that is secured by liens on the collateral that are junior to the liens that secure the Notes, the CEI Credit Facilities, the 2025 Secured Notes and the 2030 Secured Notes, then, upon such incurrence, the Collateral Agent, the Notes Trustee, the administrative agent under the CEI Credit Facilities, the trustee under the 2025 Secured Notes, the trustee under the 2030 Secured Notes, the agent under such new indebtedness and the other parties thereto will enter into a Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement (or a joinder thereto) as to the relative priorities of their respective security interests in the collateral and certain other matters relating to the administration of such security interests. The First Lien Secured Parties acknowledge that the First Priority Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the Indenture, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series. For the avoidance of doubt, the holders of the Notes expressly waive any right to share in the proceeds, if any, from title insurance policies insuring other first priority lien obligations of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries.

1052,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.24,Change of Control,59.24.1,,"Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of the holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), except to the extent the Issuer has previously or concurrently elected to redeem Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption.” Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes by delivery of a notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer shall mail a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder with a copy to the Notes Trustee stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Issuer to repurchase such holder’s Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of the holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change of Control; (3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); and (4) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a holder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased. A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control. In addition, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, 61 ----- given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and cancelled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit rating. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under the CEI Credit Agreement (including the CEI Credit Facilities). Future Bank Indebtedness of the Issuer may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Bank Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Bank Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating _to the Notes and Our Company’s Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer, which would result in a default under the Indenture and would adversely affect our business and financial condition. Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the Notes repurchased under a change of control has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control. In addition, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\u2019 prior notice, 61 ----- given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and cancelled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer\u2019s capital structure or credit rating. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under the CEI Credit Agreement (including the CEI Credit Facilities). Future Bank Indebtedness of the Issuer may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Bank Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Bank Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer\u2019s ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer\u2019s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating _to the Notes and Our Company\u2019s Indebtedness\u2014We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer, which would result in a default under the Indenture and would adversely affect our business and financial condition. Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the Notes repurchased under a change of control has occurred following a sale of \u201csubstantially all\u201d of our assets.\u201d_ The definition of \u201cChange of Control\u201d includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of \u201call or substantially all\u201d the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. 71 -----",,as_expected,2024,174,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The Indenture will provide that: (1) the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock; and (2) the Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor) to issue any shares of Preferred Stock; _provided,_ _however, that the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired_ Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and, subject to the third paragraph of this covenant, any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock or issue shares of Preferred Stock, in each case if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been Incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred (in respect of term Indebtedness) or committed (in respect of revolving Indebtedness) to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency (or in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced), and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. 71 -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

For the avoidance of doubt, the nonapplication of any amounts required to be applied to make an Asset Sale Offer or Collateral Asset Sale Offer as a consequence of the foregoing provisions does not constitute a Default or an Event of Default, and such amounts shall be available for working capital purposes of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries so long as not required to be prepaid or used to make an offer to repurchase in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any prepayments or offers to repurchase required after application of the above provision shall be net of any costs, expenses or taxes Incurred by the Issuer or any of its Affiliates and arising as a result of compliance with the preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, amounts that are not required to be applied to make an Asset Sale Offer or Collateral Asset Sale Offer due the operation of this paragraph shall not constitute “Excess Proceeds” or “Collateral Excess Proceeds” for any purpose.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a default under clauses (3) or (9) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Notes Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the default and the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3) or (9) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Notes Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding Notes by notice to the Issuer may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable; provided, however, that so long as any Bank Indebtedness remains outstanding, no such acceleration shall be effective until the earlier of (1) five Business Days after the giving of written notice to the Issuer and the Representative under any Credit Agreement and (2) the day on which any Bank Indebtedness is accelerated. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Notes Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Notes Trustee or the holders of the Notes, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Notes Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the Notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Notes Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Notes Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Notes Trustee indemnity and security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Notes Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Notes Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered the Notes Trustee reasonable security and indemnity against any loss, liability or expense; 90 ----- (4) the Notes Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Notes Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Notes Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Notes Trustee.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

1052,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1053,BOOK ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM,1053.1,The Global Notes,1053.1.1,,"We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders of the Notes may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the Notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture with respect to the Notes. 143 ----- Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of us, the Notes Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Indenture, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.” DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”). DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized bookentry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the Notes Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",,as_expected,2024,174,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary (\u201cparticipants\u201d) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants).
